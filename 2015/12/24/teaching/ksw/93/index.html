<p>Rick: Welcome Everyone to the 93rd Keshnov Keshe Knowledge seeker’s workshop. Its Thursday December 24th 2015 and this is our next to the last knowledge seekers workshop the year and we have got some various people that can show things , some picture and videos and so on but first of all, we will check on Mr. Keshe and see what he has in mind and see what today’s teaching will bring us .<br>瑞克：我们马上要开始第93次的凯史知识探索工作坊。今天是2015年12月24号，周四。这也是今年倒数第二次课程。此前我们请了很多人来上课，在课程中放一些图片或者视频等。好的，我们还是先问下凯史先生能否开始上课，看看他今天会教我们什么。</p>
<p>I think we are ready there Mr. Keshe how are you doing? Hello<br>我们已经准备好了。凯史先生，您可以开始了吗？<br>Speaker: I didn’t disappear, i just forgot to get something and i just ran to get it for you. Good morning to you, good day to you wherever you are and whenever you listen to these teachings and  what we call knowledge seekers programs  we have come a long way in establishing a lot of new technologies, a lot of new sciences. we have come in a way to understand more in how things are and how things work.<br>授课者：我刚才还在这里的，只是忽然想起忘带一些工具，就回去拿了。嗯，早上好。无论你在何时何地聆听我们的课程，我都希望你一切安好。长久以来，在知识探索项目中，我们在发展新技术、学习新的科学知识方面取得很大进步，通过以这样的方式不断了解事物及其运作方式。<br>Hopefully we have added  to the knowledge in so many ways, the correct way  on the knowledge of all and the respected scientist of the past. As i say， knowledge of science ( science, knowledge of a man） is like a house, brick by brick and  the other 2（ has bring the other two on） another brick on the wall and somehow very soon  the way we are going we will becoming a brick in the bottom of  in a new wall of science, well but at least we hope we set the foundation right that the wall on the wall of this way will there are  go up into a better state of what i call understanding.<br>希望能通过各种途径，尤其是正确的方式了解这些知识和一些历史上伟大的科学家。正如我所说，科学和个人知识的关系就像建房子，在筑墙的过程中，一块砖一块砖的向上垒，不断添砖加瓦，很快我们就成了科学这堵新墙的基石，至少我们希望自己是这样奠基、筑墙，达到较好的状态,也就是理解。<br>One of the problems i have seen in the past few weeks with the new teachings especially with the plasma is  how people are the way the people i developing new technologies  different aspects  of this technology with the way they see it on the thing they see it  and how some of you are adding to the knowledge what in a way, in a very beautiful way and you are adding to the knowledge in a the way you understand it and that was the purpose of these teachings.<br>我发现在前几周的新课中，尤其是等离子课程，存在一些问题。人是如何从个人认识事物的角度延伸出有关此技术的其他方面；如何清晰透彻地认识事物，增长见闻；如何通过个人理解来增长见识，而解决这些问题正是此课程的目的。<br>So allow individuals to participate in the development of the technology.and not just to do as we do monkey see monkey does. There are a number of things which has been, in so many ways, interesting for us to learn and teach and in so many ways every now and then we need a summing up of what we learnt, what we knew, what we thought. What has been the total understanding and what has been the essence of how things look and are and how they should be.<br>因此，我们要允许并鼓励个人参与发展技术，而不只是鹦鹉学舌。很多事情，在很多方面，都值得我们去学和教，需要我们不时地总结所学、所知、所想、所理解的以及事物的现象和本质。<br>In the last couple of weeks we have taken a new direction in the course of teachings and as we become more and more plasma oriented and work. Today  i am going to bring to you a very fundamental knowledge, It is so fundamental that you all have done it, you all are doing it but as i said we are going in such a high speed of teaching that for everyone to understand the whole teaching is very very difficult.<br>在过去的几周里，我们的教学步入了新方向，变得越来越等离子化了。今天，我打算带领大家学习一些基础知识，之所以说它是基础，是因为你们都做过，而且还正在做，但因为课程进度比较快，让你们理解整个课程还是非常困难的。<br>It is extremely hard to follow it unless we recap every now and then so today and next week not only are trying to add to the knowledge but recap and add in a way that start making sense to a lot of people. If you go back to the original teaching and , i will try yo use a marker that you can see, we spoke all the time about the plasma and we said the plasma is expantional and it expands, this when we draw it like this we only  speak about magnetical  or gravitational  but this it the mean average both ways of what is brought in as magnetic and what is brought in as gravitational and gravitational is always more than magnetical and magnetical if it gives too much and gravitational does not take in plus one or at least higher order strength, that when it becomes lower it becomes the strength of the magnetic or and  displacement of the fields then we don’t have a  mass, the mass come from when the gravity increases.<br>如果我们今天和下周时不时地回顾这些知识，那很容易就能跟上进度。这样做不只是为了增加知识，还要总结概括并以浅显易懂的方式让更多人了解。如果你们回顾以前的课程，（我会用记号笔画出以便你们能理解）不难发现，我们一直在讲等离子。我们一直说，等离子体不断运动扩展，像我画的这样，要么是磁力作用要么是引力作用，事实上，它一般是受两者共同作用，即磁力作用和引力作用，（右边MAC=磁力，左边GR=引力，磁力向外，引力向内，方向相反，不单独存在，共同成为一个整体）引力作用一般会大于磁力作用。如果磁力增大，而引力没有增加或至少变成更高的强度，所以当引力作用越来越小，等离子体就主要受磁力的作用，在磁场发生位移，难以测量其质量，只有引力作用增大时，才会有质量（让磁力大于引力就能产生飞升）。（注：引力指的原来是等离子体之间相互作用的万有引力）<br>So what we did if you recap we went into the stage of looking at the very first original reactors which were built in early 2005 , 2006 and before and we came and we showed the first reactor which was shown as the dome. remember the blue ones and the black ones and we showed that we put a cap inside it, we made it 2 cores the way as it goes at the centre one becomes a caroline core and the other becomes what we call the outer core.<br>如果你温习了，接下来我们就看看2005，2006年早期建立的首个原始反应器，它像一个圆屋顶，记住那些蓝色的和黑色的，然后我们在里面加一个帽，这样反应器就有了两个核心，位于中心的就是凯若琳核心，而另一个就是我们所说的外核心。<br>In a way we try to create 2 division of the strength of the fields. in some cases we created the rotation in both clockwise，in some cases we created both anticlockwise, and in some case we can rotate one clockwise and one anti clockwise of the two, but at the end, it wasn’t a physical rotation of the core which counted it was the how the gravitational and magnetic fields in each section or what we thought we created a wall decided to move. We had one section which created its own field and with our knowledge we created a second field.<br>这样，我们就创造了磁场力的两个分层。在某些情况下，我们创建两个顺时针旋转；在某些情况下，我们创建两个逆时针旋转；在某些情况下，我们可以创建一个顺时针旋转和一个逆时针旋转。但最后，这并不是核心的物理旋转，而是通过计算各部分引力场和磁力场的强度而旋转的，或如我们所想，建立一堵墙（隔层）（凯史在半圆形里面画了一些绿色的波纹，指的是隔层，wall)促使其运动。本来一个部分里只有一个磁场，而我们依靠所学又创建了第二个磁场（凯史在下面又画了一些蓝色的线，指的是第二个磁场）。<br>In so many ways if we recap and go back understand the knowledge on what we have added up to now that has been that we have a caroline core and we have a second core what or we call the outer core or its traditionally known as, we found out, you will find out does the physical barrier of what we call to be the inner core acceptable.or how we got stuck with this idea  because as a physical Intangible tangible idea of this existence of physicality that we could say  up to there is this matter  and inside is different.<br>在很多方面，如果我们回顾到现在学过的知识，有一个凯若琳核心和另一个传统意义上讲的外核心，你会发现我们所说的物理隔层作为内核心是否成立或者我们怎样陷入这个疑团的，因为作为物理的有形存在，我们可以说，正是此物质，内部有所不同。<br>In reality we have seen the physical matter now with the reactors,  the gases (X)and the nanomaterials you made. material state field is irrelevant, what the field strength decides, inside or outside which dictates the position and the interaction. So what we assume to be the caroline core, for example, and is obtained contained  in the physical wall of the inner core,  how we assume and we could explain which was acceptable at a time was that this inner core where we have like this is a solid and is said that it holds containment of the matter inside it and it leads to the creation of one field and then the second field created by the rotation of the outer core leads to creation of 2 fields, one going this way and and the other one going that way (the outer core in the anticlockwise direction, the inner core in the clockwise direction)， or both go the same direction or as we added to the knowledge and （00.15.07）we know for example in the stars in the sun, there is no inner core outer core, the boundaries are made by the interaction of the field strength， so in a way the theory of the  inner core of the earth becomes invalid, does not make any validation.<br>实际上，装有反应器的物质、甘斯、纳米材料与物质的场强之间是不相干的。场强度决定了内部和外部的等离子体的位置和相互作用。那么，例如，假设这是凯若琳核心，其包含在一个内核心的物理壁隔层之中，我们应如何假设呢？也许我们可以这样解释，正如图上我画的这个内核心是固体，（此处在里面的核心外围又画了一个圈，并用笔涂实）它里面包含了一些物质，这样便形成第一个磁场，外核心的旋转运动形成了第二个磁场，此时，外磁场可能逆时针旋转，内磁场顺时针旋转（凯史画了两个箭头）；或是两者同方向运动，或是我们所了解的在星星和太阳中，没有内核心、外核心之说，磁场的边界都是在场强度的相互作用下形成的（凯史画了一个黄色的圈），那么在某种程度上，地球的内核心理论是不成立的。<br>Because now what it is is the magnetic gravitational field which is made by 1 section in different strength in fact（ respect of ）  another section which is this part now holds validity now makes sense. because in the sun there is no solid core. In the sun  in the stars in the galaxies., we don’t see solid walls separating galaxies from each other. We see the gravitational magnetic field strength which creates that separation, point of no interaction or balance interaction so in so many ways in what we been taught in the beginning of the time of the new science of the geological structure of the earth where there is a inner core and what we call the inner inner  core which is known as the caroline core and the outer core become totally meaningless.<br>因为该部分磁引力场的强度不同（凯史在绿圈与黑圈之间画了波纹，表示内核心的场强）。而另一部分（凯史画了一个双箭头，表示内核的场强与黑色大圈外圈的磁引力场的交互力），产生效用，使其成立。因为太阳没有固体核心.太阳、星球以及星系间，都没有固态的隔层将星系区分开来，而是磁引力场将其分隔，没有相互作用或维持平衡的相互作用，正如我们最初学习的地球地质结构学中，地球有一个内核，内核的内核，也就是众所周知的凯若琳内核，以及外核，都变得毫无意义。<br>In the centre of the earth, there is section which creates its own gravitational magnetic field and through the structure or whatever physicality its field strength interact with another field strength which could be created by a part of the outer core or the  lower of the physical structure of the earth and so we receive the interaction of the 2 fields which the interaction of the 2  gives us the magnetical and the gravitational fields of the planet.<br>在地心中，有一部分形成了自身的磁引力场，通过地质结构或任何物质，其磁场强度与可能在外核心或较低的地球物理结构中形成的磁场强度相互作用，使我们能监测到，那么，两者的相互作用也就形成了行星的磁引力场。[11:50]<br>So it is very interesting now that we understand this, now that we understand the structure change with a simple, very simple idea, this outer core to your magnetic coil, and change this one to your gravitational coil so what happens? The field strength of your gravitational coil which you put inside each other is not a physical matter of the copper and or nano materials, it’s is the interaction of the nanocoated material  with which the field interaction where with the field interaction of the nano-coated of the gravitational coil creates the field flow.<br>这就有意思了。既然我们已经了解这些知识，那么对这个结构进行一些简单的改变，把外核心变成磁场线圈（MAG COIL=磁力线圈）（马克笔标出的最外层的圆圈），让这个（黑色实心圈）变成引力线圈（GRAV这里指的是引力线圈），接下来会发生什么？（能量盒线圈的构造就是根据行星或宇宙的结构来的）<br>放在彼此磁场里的引力线圈的场强度并不是铜质或纳米材料的物理问题，而是纳米涂层材料相互作用的结果，磁场的相互作用与有纳米涂层的引力线圈的磁场的相互作用产生了磁场流。<br>So if you make section have crossed your  springs 此处为回转的线which you made, what you should see is the structure of the inner part of the planet, you should see the structure of the inner part of the solar cell star, you should  then see the structure of the universal creation of the universe. It’s Is the section of the structure of the  universe which man has not seen up to now and or has not had the ability to look at it and or has not had the tools to observe it, follows the same principle. Then the question to ask is are we in the inner circle or are we in the outer circle? Are we in a gravitational field flow galaxies or are we in a magnetical field flow galaxies?<br>所以，如果你将弹簧交叉（画了一个弹簧）从而制作一个单元的部分，你应该能看到地球的内部结构，应该知晓太阳、恒星的内部结构，然后你就知道宇宙的结构。那么，人类迄今为止没有观察到的，或是没有能力看到的、抑或没有工具能观察到的宇宙也是遵循这样的原理。那么问题来了，我们是在内圈还是在外圈呢？我们是在引力场流星系还是在磁力场流星系呢？（指的是宇宙的构成分为引力场宇宙与磁力场宇宙，如宙斯星球可能在引力场宇宙，能量盒弹簧的构造就是按照宇宙构造来的）<br>There is a reason i raise this point because a lot of you in the past years have followed the work, have been through it , made the ping pong balls, made a steel coils made the small copper coils, you made the 21 cm coils from the steel and we all followed the procedure step by step to mature to understand.<br>我提出这一点是有原因的。很多人几年前就在做这项工作，也经历了很多，做乒乓球、钢卷、小的铜线圈，从钢材上抽出21cm的线圈，循序渐进，日益成熟。<br>Can I ask a question? Do you see my writing correct way or is it sideway to you ?<br>Okay , let me see if i get the right way<br>OKay you should have told.<br>Talking is a good thing<br>Lets see if we can get it done this way<br>how is it now? …I’m writing upside down and nobody said it to me.<br>我想知道，你们看这张图是正的还是斜的？好吧，那我来看看对不对。如果不对，你们应该告诉我的。交流是好事。来看看这样做对不对。现在怎么样？我把图画颠倒了，也没有人告诉我。<br>Okay , I’ll see how I can help you. Just wait a few minutes.<br>那我来试试怎样把它放正。稍等一下。<br>[coughing]<br>Is it okay now or is still sideway or upside down?<br>I cannot get it right side up<br>[singing]<br>how did we get to this<br>that is not the problem<br>Is it better now ?</p>
<p>That is not a problem<br>Is it okay now ?<br>No worry we will get it right one day  18:43<br>现在好了吗？是斜的还是颠倒的？我好像摆不正了。<br>[哼唱]现在怎样？小菜一碟。现在好些没有？没事儿，现在可以了吗？不着急，我们会把它摆正。<br>So what we come down to is the reality that does the situation with what we gathered or what we think exactly what we see here ,what is important is hence or have we missed a very big part in the whole of what has been taught in the past few days, in the past few weeks, be it in private teaching, be it in public teaching because, (im going to move this out of the way and move a little bit that way) so let us look at what we have and what we have done, go back to the beginning, go back into what we started and how we come, because by the end of this today’s session, you will find out a new dimension in a lot of things which you have done. a lot of things which has been added on.<br>接下来我们要认清这样一个事实，我们收集的和猜想的情况就是我们现在看到的吗？那么什么才是重要的，或者说，我们在几天前或前几周的教学中遗漏了重要信息。无论是私人教学还是公开课，（我要把这张纸调整一下）我们好好看下我们已知的和我们已经做过的，让我们好好回顾一下开始阶段，好好想想我们地课程是从哪里开始，又是怎样进行的。因为今天课程结束，你们会到达一个不同以往学习的新层面，学到新的知识。<br>Why i raised this point, look at this, this is structure of what you call the earth in this bracket here, is the structure of everything that we know has been done up to now in all the teachings. we have just changed the tools we have just changed the elements. This is the first inner core 8 years ago, 7-8 years ago nearly. This is the first structure we did in , what was it 10, 12 years ago.<br>为什么我会这样说，你们看看，方框里的结构图就是地球，就是截至目前所学到的所有知识，我们只是更换了一些工具和一些要素。这是7、8年前的第一个内核心，（图中黑色实心圆环）这是10或12年前我们做的第一个结构。<br>This is the same structure as the little gas balls you made.  This is the same structure when you added gas in . It is the same structure as the centre of the planet earth. It is the same structure as the earth, It i s the same structure as the sun. It is the same structure as your coils, nothing has changed. Creating gravitational section or creation a different section with a different strength and then cascading it with another field strength with another system.<br>这种构造和你做的气体反应器一样，和你把气体充进去的结构一样，和地心结构一样，和太阳的结构一样，和你做的线圈是一样的，什么都没有变。创造引力场或创建另一个不同强度的磁场，然后将其与另一个系统的磁场相互作用。<br>The present coil system we use, we use the same copper coil, nano coated, gas coated what about if you use and aluminium coil and copper coil and nano coated  both of them. won’t we get a more effective gravitational magnetic field. What about if you put the aluminium outside and put the copper inside. would the choice of material by putting brass and the copper will make the difference? because now the field  if you created by the centre due to the composite materials within the gas of the brass is totally different that the copper outside. Extend the knowledge to the point where this become your core markup set and this becomes your house. Can we create a system that the interaction of your coils creates a position within the house that you don’t need no wiring you work with field instruction.<br>我们现在用的线圈系统，都只是纳米涂层的，甘斯涂层的铜线圈。如果同时使用纳米涂层的铝线圈和铜线圈会如何？磁引力场的作用力会不会更显著？如果铝层在外，铜层在内，效果会怎样？选材时，如果黄铜材质的线圈放在内圈，铜质的放在外圈，会有不同吗？因为这个核心的磁场来源于甘斯涂层的黄铜与外层铜质这两种截然不同的材料之间的作用。假设中间的黑色实心圈是主要的参照点，最外面的圆圈就是房子，那么我们能否在房间内创建这样一个系统，线圈间的相互作用使你不需要装电线便可以在磁场的作用下工作。<br>Teaching is to  ?not to monkey see monkey does. but another part of this is important because if we go back and if we look at what we did. Look at what we did. I draw a circle and you put a dot pole on top, you call this  the ping pong balls. You rotated it you put a motor on it and you rotate as fast as you could, you saw the sections in it on it  but still you contain the matter part of the plasma within the structure of the plasma.<br>教学不是让你一味地鹦鹉学舌，还有一点很重要。如果我们回顾以往学习，看看我们是怎么做的。画一个圆圈，上面有个洞，这就是我们所说的乒乓球，然后放上发动机让它高速转动，你就会知道洞周围的环境，但你控制了等离子结构的等离子体的物质部分。<br>you created the star formation and we saw the effect of the fields to create a free plasma. （00.30.04）we created the coils and we connect the coils, we see return on the power supply. If you look, up to now acts of this position we always have contained the plasma, elements of the matter part of the plasma.<br>通过创造星型组合，我们了解到磁场间的相互作用生成自由等离子体。通过使用线圈，并将其连接到一起，就会知道能量供应的循环或回转。现在，如果你注意到此区域（图像中三角中的的圆圈）的运动，我们总在试着控制这个等离子体，以及等离子体的物质要素。<br>Is there a way where we can create a plasma which itself can hold itself but we create a field force that itself dictates its own containment. In the teaching of last week, i explained a very simple thing that a lot of you missed or understood but did not take notice or it wasn’t important because it was just an issue. I explained how  the motion and  trend in the rotation of the plasma  is created by the equatorial rotation or by polarity rotation.<br>有没有一种方法可以实现等离子体自制而不是我们去创建磁场利用磁力实现自制。在上周的教学中，我讲了一个比较简单的知识点，可能很多人忘记了，即使理解了也没注意，觉得它不重要，毕竟只是一个问题。当时我向大家阐释了等离子体的旋转趋势是赤道循环或极性循环。<br>We explained, it doesn’t matter which way we look at it, the interaction of these 2 field forces leads to the rotation of the physical plasma. Where is the maximum amount of fields which is absorbed inside a plasma at the equator line at this point.  This is your gravitational absorption and this  is magnetic adsorption or repulsion.<br>它的循环运动方向和我们观察方式是没有关系的，两个磁场间（黄色线与黑色线）的相互作用导致这个物理化的等离子体的旋转<br>。在赤道线的这个点，（与极线交叉的点）等离子吸收磁场作用的最大强度，这就是引力吸收效应，（横面的是赤道运动，纵向是极性运动）极性循环上的作用则是磁力吸收效应或是排斥效应。<br>Then go a step further and ask yourself a very fundamental question and the question is we have been told that where we have, i will try split this next to each other so that you can see it because it is important. Where here we have magnetical rotation and we have equatorial rotation which is a gravitational rotation what we have assumed up to now is when we have the sun and we have the earth, because of the direct line on the equator we get the maximum heat due to its facing the sun or be it that way closer or constantly on the same line on the straight.  direct line.<br>如果再深入一点，思考一个基础性问题，（我会换另一张纸进行解释，方便你们学习，因为这个知识点很重要）根据我们了解的磁力循环和赤道循环也就是引力循环，假设这是太阳，这是地球（左边太阳，右边地球），由于地球赤道正对着太阳或距离太阳相对较近（在地球上画了一横线，表示赤道），所以在地球自转和公转过程中这条线上能吸收到最大热量。<br>If we understood all of this and on what we thought before, we understand a flaw in the technology or a science which we have accepted. The equatorial line is always the most heated part of any element of any plasma be it the sun be it the earth. because this is the point where 2 fields constantly interact, if you see this, you understand very clearly that the flaw that the equatorial heat comes due to placing the sun constantly does not apply is not correct. Because the rotational polarity and equatorial rotation of magnetical in the field strength creates the heat and in respect to where the heat seats and how the heat is  distributed to the temperature gradient which partially leads to what we call the heating of the earth,  any system. This is important because in the future when you start working with the plasma totally, you find out you cannot ignore this heating line which comes from rotational diagonal or the polarity and equator.<br>如果我们能够理解之前学过的所有知识点，就会发现之前认可的该项技术或科学中存在的一个谬论：无论是太阳，还是地球，赤道线一直都是等离子体上接收热量最大的地方，因为这部分一般持续的受两个磁场的相互作用（在两条线交互地方画了两个圆圈）。如果你知道这一点，那么赤道热量来自于地球与太阳的相对位置这种观点是不正确的<br>。因为是（地球本身的）极性循环场强度和赤道磁力循环场强度相互作用产生热量，热量的分布引起温度梯度的变化，从而从某种程度上我们称为地球或任何系统中的热力。这一点非常重要，当你日后完全从事等离子体相关的工作，就会发现受对角线循环或是极性和赤道循环作用影响的热量线不容忽视。<br>This puts a lot of assumptions which we have why there is such a high heat on the equator line and to into that now we understand the reality why . Not because of its position with respect to the sun. Then this makes a lot of things which we assume totally on balanced with the whole interaction of plasma in the whole world of assumption of plasma interaction . This is now brings another subject into the whole understanding.<br>一直以来，有很多假设试图解释赤道线上热量高的原因，现在我们终于明白其成因，并不是与太阳距离的位置因素，这样一来，我们做出的关于等离子体相互作用的很多假设就可以得到解释。这样把另一个主题引入到我们整体的理解中。<br>Here we explained that the magnetical and the gravitational field interaction. Here we created the containment with the ping pong balls or copper coils; here we spoke that the fields of these copper coils or ping pong balls leave the physical boundary and they interact and they create free plasma position. If you understood this and you understood what we put on the table in the past few weeks, a lot of you from 26 of October, November, start  making all of these coils. You are looking for allusive power, I am looking for allusive lift where you made the position where all of you got so carried away with the energy that you missed the the reality of the work of what they put on the table in these coils.<br>在这里，我向大家解释了磁力场和引力场的相互作用，第一幅图解释了乒乓球或铜线圈的控制性能，第二幅图解释了铜线圈或乒乓球的物理边界以及通过相互作用产生自由等离子体及其位置。如果你们能弄清楚这些知识，就理解了前几周我们在课桌上制作材料的原理。很多人是从10月26号或11月开始制作这些线圈的。你们是寻找这些工具潜在的运转动力，而在你们的注意力被桌上这些线圈运行的能量吸引而忽视其工作原理时，我在寻找当时暗含的支撑论据。</p>
<p>I will bring the paper up. You will have a look. Maybe some of you understand.where things are very much misunderstood. Now if you understood and you are now understand the operation of this system, is under the way to create boundaryless free plasma where you have a controller. If you understood listen and watch maybe a lot of you will be shocked with what is going to come on the table for you.<br>我会把这张纸拿上来，你们好好对比看一下，可能很多人就会明白很多地方都被人误解了。如果现在你们已经了解这个系统的工作原理，那么就能明白在控制器的周围会产生不受边界限制的自由等离子体。如果你们仔细观察，认真聆听，就会为接下来桌上会发生的事情所震惊。<br>I am going to hold it in my hands i hope i wont damage it, it is coming a long way from phillipine. You have your magnetic core, you have your gravitational core. Would it be right to reposition the tool in a way that the magnetic core sits within the gravitational and inside you create a free plasma. The plasma which you have the control of , you can dictate the power of and you can decide in how it will move. In a way if you look at this, you can put this in a rotational way this way and leave your gravitational is online on its own line.  This is what i wanted to bring you with building this, but in a way we have the side benefit with the power supply. The whole purpose of teaching the coil system you looked as usual for energy i looked for the free parts. If you understood and understand you can expand and build a coil exactly like this which goes this way and leave your gravitational coil this way. In the center ball here which is a spherical. If you look at it it would be like this. If i can put it that way, it would be something like this. Without me damaging the system, it would be something like this.<br>我把线圈拿在手上，希望不会弄坏，这是从菲律宾运来的，外面这一圈是磁力圈，里面的是引力圈。不知道可否重新调换位置，把磁力圈放在引力圈里面，相互垂直，中间产生自由等离子。你可以控制它，可以提供动力，并决定其运动方式。在你观察这个结构时，你可以让磁力圈逆时针旋转，引力圈仍在自己的运动轨迹上，我想让你们按照这个方式建立该系统，但我们可能仅在电力供应上享有一定的有利条件。讲授线圈系统的目的是平常你们主要寻找能量供应，而我关注的是自由等离子部分。如果你能弄明白这些，就可以发散思维，制造这样的线圈结构，磁力圈是赤道循环，引力圈是极性循环，中间区域是球形的。应该是你们看到的这个样子，我会把它立起来，希望没有毁坏这个系统，就是你们看到的这样。<br>Now here you create a plasma which is exactly which is an exact copy of the plasma of the universe. Which is an exact copy of the plasma of the sun.This will dictate the magnetic and this dictates the gravitational but this has a beauty. This ring itself  has  both gravitational and magnetic fields while this both has the same both gravitational magnetic fields. So in fact by making the coil we have made the 2 essence of the creation of the plasma, fields continuously interacting and the fields here have to interact more at this level here if i can turn it this way. You can see it at this level where equator line you get more fields being absorbed into gravitational. The 2 gravitational field are closer and closer as they are closer magnetical gives to this to make it more rotational gravitational and on this side the magnetic will be the same. So you have achieved in fact, i hope i haven’t damaged it because this is a lot of way but it is the only way we can teach. So what is we see is the true structure of the plasma.<br>现在我们创建的等离子体正是宇宙或是太阳等离子体的翻版。外面的线圈控制磁力，里面的线圈控制引力，这样很美好。那么，内外层的圆环都有磁引力场。事实上，我们制作的线圈系统已包含创造等离子体的两个基本要素，磁场间相互作用并且在这个层面上的磁场不得不互动的更多<br>，如果我把线圈翻过来，你们可以看到在两个线圈距离最近的地方相互作用更明显。你们可以发现在这种层面上，在赤道线上更多的磁场都被吸收成为引力场，两个引力场离得越近，磁力场就会更容易受引力场影响，而在另一边的磁力场也是如此。事实上，我们已经还原了等离子体的结构。希望我没有破坏这个系统，虽说有很多方式可以教你们，但这是目前的唯一方法。<br>In so many ways when you stack this up in a tree stacker, you try to create the same essence of work, which was gravitational and magnetical, gravitational and magnetical, Gravitational and magnetical, but in a way a magnetical and a total gravitational to  put which makes it stronger.<br>如果你试图创建整个系统的基本结构，把这些叠加起来，引力圈和磁力圈；引力圈和磁力圈，引力圈和磁力圈，再是一个磁力圈和总的引力圈，成树状栈式存储器，这样就使得整个系统作用力更强。<br>So if you understood this. We covered all basis of production of the plasma in a very simple way this had the physical containment, this had matter component. In this setup in this structure, if you can understand and take a step further. You will understand now you have more or less near enough free plasma control. Where you can change the gravity in the centre or change the magnetic in the outer.<br>如果你明白了我们讲过的关于等离子的所有基础知识，简单来说，第一纸的第一幅图是关于物理控制，第二幅图是组成要素，在黄色板子上的这个实物图中，如果你能再深入一点，多少都会明白自由等离子体的控制，这样便可以改变中心的引力或是外围的磁力。<br>If you understood this process, now you see another tool in the arsenal of plasma play. A huge tool. For those of you who can understand and can take this to the next level you will have a wonderful time, because now you can add into the atmosphere as you like, you can replicate the structure of other planets that can interfere with the free plasma.<br>如果你了解了这个过程，就会明白它是等离子体军火库中非常强大的工具。对于已经弄清楚这一过程，并能继续深入的人来说，这是一个非常美妙的过程。因为你可以根据个人喜好控制磁场，据此可以复制其它星球的结构，使之与自由等离子体相互作用。<br>Now in fact if you look at it you have a free plasma condition. It is like water. You decide what you are going to add what colour, what texture, what material how and then you can change it.If you understood the whole process from the beginning, you will understand a very simple criteria. And that is we have reached a point near enough to demonstration of the creation of the plasma in the way the universe does it, with a  difference that here now we don’t look at the copper as a copper wire, we look at the gans nanocoated material which our plasma take and the copper is inside it is irrelevant. it is totally and absolutely irrelevant, it can be anything. It can be a hair, it can be aluminium, it can be titanium, it can be anything.<br>事实上，如果你现在找个处于自由等离子状态下的物质，好好观察观察。比如水，你可以随意添加颜色、质地、原料，决定怎样添加来改变。如果你从最开始就了解这个过程，就会明白这个基本原理。这样我们就了解宇宙中等离子体的出现，不同的是，我们不把铜看作铜线，带纳米涂层材料的甘斯的等离子体与其内部材质为铜并无关系。这两者完全没有联系，它（材质）可以是任何东西，头发、铝、钛等等。<br>It is the fields which will dictate the creation of the plasma inside in the center and now you can control with that the plasma. You are looking for energy and you are looking for free plasma, out of those set up bring the knowledge to the point that all of you one way or another will start moving into next step for free plasma and if you can do this, then you made 4 coils and open your coils and twist them and place them at the state in 90 degrees in respect to each other the way i show you very much like, i can get the paper out of the that really watch like this,<br>磁场的相互作用促使结构中心等离子体的产生，现在你可以控制等离子体。你要寻找动力也要寻找自由等离子体。除了那些刚开始学习的人，你们可以进入下一步观察了解自由等离子。如果你可以动手做四个线圈，先把线圈打开，再卷起来，相邻两个线圈呈90度放置，像我给你们讲的那样，我把这张纸拿出来你们再看看。<br>Now you have the beauty of a control plasma without any tangibility, where here you went to create it here now you control it. This is another way to create a free plasma.But this is the way what the universal systems create plasma.<br>现在就能感受到无形的等离子体在控制整个磁场，这是很美妙的一种现象。在第二幅图中创造等离子体，现在则能控制等离子体。这是创造自由等离子体的另一种方式，也是宇宙创造等离子体的方式。<br>It Is the plasma created from the inner core or is the plasma created when the matter outside creates such a mass that their fields interaction leads to the creation of the plasma inside out.Then this raises another question. Is centre of every structure hollow. Hollow of a visible matter we see but full and saturated with high level magnetic and gravitational field of the plasma. Does the hollow center earth have any meaning ? Does the hollow centre sun have any meaning. Hollow in a way that none physical visible matter is state at the man point of vision? Yes it is hollow.<br>等离子体是由内核心产生的还是外部物质产生质量，从而促使磁场相互作用产生的？这就引发了下面一个问题。每个结构的中心部分是空心吗？是我们可以看到的空心物质但有充分饱和的高层次磁引力场的等离子吗？空心的地球说得通吗？空心的太阳说得通吗？是在人的视觉条件下，以一种不可见物质为状态的空心化吗？是的，是空心的。(hollow=虚空的）<br>You saw this in a ping pong balls when you put them on rotation. You saw the hollowness suddenly was an empty gap in between and i explained many times that the empty gap has come by the interaction of the fields or interaction of the gases which are winning within the cup, winning within the bowl. This is another tool in a way that can lead you to flight control which we are looking for to production of the material in a household plasma level for the first time. it is in the hand of you and you can decide, because lets look at it this way we saw what alex showed us last week with the onions what he did we put with the orange. You made the star formation balls. Now let us make the springs . You have the spring which is going this way, you have a spring which is going  this way. You have a spring which is going here and you have a spring which is going there. You have a spring here and you have a spring there. You created spring here and you created spring there. Hollow plasma. But interesting a point which you might have not noticed is this itself creates its own plasma, then look.<br>当你让乒乓球不断旋转运动时，会发现乒乓球内就是这样的情况。两者之间的空心突然变成一个裂口，对此我已解释多次，由于磁场或甘斯的相互作用出现了这个裂缝，它也可能存在于杯子或碗中。这也是引导你第一次从等离子角度寻找生产材料实现控制的另一种工具。决定权在你手上，让我们回顾一下上周阿历克斯讲授的有关洋葱的实验,我们当时用的是橘子。之前做了星型组合的球体，现在让我们来用弹簧。先让弹簧横放，再竖着放；然后在图中四个位置放上同样形状的弹簧，然后中间是空心等离子体。有趣的是，你可能没有注意到它本身就是一个等离子体。你们可以对比看看。<br>The hollow plasma, center plasma free, and the outer plasma dictated by the interaction of the control of the matter. Then now for the first time you have full control to change gravitational magnetic fields of each individually and this will create you what you wanted 4 free plasma, and if you can take it to this level and understand this you will find out you will need no rotation, you will need no in a way of physical structure because if you lock position of these, then the only thing  that is left is for the fields to interact on every direction. And for everyone to understand in a very simply way. You have a system which not only conserves its own energy but it allows you to create a position of different field strength across the its environment according to whatever you need might be.<br>空心等离子体就是中心等离子，是自由的，物质的相互作用控制外部的等离子体。接下来你就可以完全控制改变每个等离子体的磁引力，从而出现四个自由等离子体。如果你已进行到这一层面，你会发现并不需要旋转或任何物理结构，因为如果将这些位置像这样固定（画了三个箭头），接下来唯一需要做的就是磁场间各个方向相互作用。简单说来就是你创建了一个系统，不仅能量守恒，而且允许你在当前磁场环境中，根据需要创建满足不同磁场强度的位置（在单元之间画了几个圆圈，表示相互的磁引力场，并画了一个大圈，表示整体）。<br>And this is what in so many ways in the world of chemistry a chemical bond. You can see that it is tried to be filled up in atomic structure or whatever you call it with the composition of electron position, electrons protons and neutrons. But the totally totality sits in this structure teaching.</p>
<p>If you manage to connect these in a way that you can dictate the gravitational magnetic field of each one into a box then you decide this to reduce or that to increase or what and can be done so with any of the and in a very simple way, you can create the allusive lift.？ Because now you don’t have to have the gas and rubit or put in the container. for the first time you have created the free plasma into essence of free. With on no physical contact containment and in a way transparent that the energy can go flow in and out of it. This brings into play a lot of understanding in a lot of ways in what you call chemistry and physics in space technology, in development of the space technology. This allows every man to be able to take into space.<br>很大程度上，这就是化学世界中的化学联系。你会发现它在试图填满整个原子结构，或是不管你叫它电子的位置，电子、质子和中子。但它的整体就是我们刚刚学习的知识。如果你试图把每个等离子的磁引力场连接起来到一个盒子里（在下面画了一个盒子），你只需要通过控制盒子减少或增加某一个场强度，然后你就可以轻而易举的创造飞升，因为现在不需要甘斯或者旋转或将其放入一个容器中。这是你第一次使自由等离子真正实现自由，没有物理控制，显然，能量也可以流进流出。在空间技术的发展中，这就向我们解释了有关该领域物理和化学的很多问题，能够让每个人都可以了解太空。<br>I said last week this is your stacker. And if you can put 4 of your stackers then you can position them in the right place. You will find you will achieve a point where you can lift. Not necessarily Where not .. you can only lift but in putting you reactors in position, if you get your position of the field right, you can allow other materials to lift without ever being made into the structure. Then by changing these fields, you do not need to have the material within the frame of the system, you can position it outside or inside the frame or you can dictate it in how much level up  it goes. This is part of directional transportation and directional communication without any matter of state at the super conductivity in the matter of the plasma. You call this the physicality of the man, you call this the emotion of the man and call this the soul of the man. 55’<br>上周，我提到这就是栈式存储器，如果你有4个栈式存储器并将其放在正确的位置，那么你就可以找到支撑飞升的点。不只是能举起抬高，还可以把反应器放在相应位置。如果磁场各部分的位置设计合理，（淡色的圈是反应器，深色的是磁场）其他物质不需要融入该结构就可以在这个结构中被举起来（在深色圈里画了两个叉叉）。（三角形表示整个结构）通过改变磁场强度，不需要把物质添加到该系统的架构中，你可以把它们放在框架的里面或是外围，或是控制其向上的程度。这是等离子体中没有任何超导电性物质条件下的定向传输和定向沟通。你们称三角形最上面的层次为人类的肉体、三角内部的是人类的精神，肉体之外，也就是三角外面的是人的灵魂。<br>Where physicality does not need to operate within the totality of the structure and the fields can be outside and you decide how this field is ejected to which direction as you can change this and you can run a very easy communication through zero time but matter. So you can see how the coils come into operation.<br>物质不需要在整体结构中运行，磁场也可以分布在结构外围，（画了一个圆圈）通过改变，你可以决定磁场向哪个方向发射（飞升的方向，在上面画了一个三角箭头），可以随时进行零延迟的沟通，因此，你便能看到线圈是怎样工作的。<br> You can see how the position of the coils for the first time gives you the freedom which you did not have with any of the setup before, but it was part of the teaching. But you had to need to understand how everything works, because it was part of the structure to set or structure to work with.<br>你会第一次看到线圈的位置带给你自由，当初你并没有这样的安排，但这也是课程的一部分，你必须弄清楚各部分是怎样工作的，因为这些结构是你接下来要建立的或是要运行的。<br>But one thing interesting you will see is the same proposition as what we saw in the pre free plasma of the gases galaxies. Where you made the ball you saw the free, now that you make the plasmas in the centre and you will see one thing that these plasma will have the same hollow centre. That is where the field are so powerful and the matter level that we don’t see it but if we absorbed at the higher level. If we develop technologies where we can go in, we will see this is the structure.<br>不过，你会发现一个很有趣的现象，它和我们此前发现的关于星系中自由等离子的命题一样。当你做球的时候，你会发现自由等离子，现在你把自由等离子放在中间，你会发现这些等离子都是空心的。这就是磁场如此强大所在，我们在物质层面是看不到的，但是，如果我们从更高层次上了认识这一点，努力开发相关技术，就会明白这一结构。<br>High magnetic fields which is the gravitational working with the lower magnetic field which is magnetic and consequently the rotation of the plasma. Conversion of the strength into motion. This point will become very very important in the coming days and the coming weeks while you get and do the jobs you have done with the systems. If you start making these coils, and if you start positioning these coils more than a flat into a spherical shape.<br>高磁力场就是引力场和较低的磁力场的相互作用，从而实现等离子体的旋转运动，磁场的强度转换为等离子体的旋转运动，在接下来几周的教学中，这一点对于继续学习了解等离子系统相当重要，尤其是在制作线圈，将这些线圈放置成球体而非平面图形时。<br>Excuse me just one second i have to do something in the back.<br>抱歉，请稍微等一下，我有点事情要去后面一下。<br>The whole structure changes. The whole  understanding changes, the whole teaching of the creation of the plasma changes. If you understood for example the gravitational magnetic fields interaction at the equator, （01.00.00）it should not be very far for you to be able to create a heating element with the coils you have. It should not be very difficult to make systems that are heaters.<br>整个系统会发生改变，所有认知会发生改变，整个关于等离子体的教学也会发生改变。比方说，如果你能明白赤道线上磁引力场的相互作用，那你基本上就可以把手边的线圈做成一个热量单位，这样就不难把整个系统做成加热器了。<br>You can make and use the same system for high gravitational magnetic field for communication lines. You can make systems which give you all the facilities for everything which you need and you want, because now you have understood hopefully and you can see the beauty of this system inside the gravitational magnetic field which even the magnetic has a magnetic gravitational section to it. While it is getting its giving , while it is getting it is giving and taking at the same time. That is exactly the true way a plasma works. Where the gaps comes in and the fields go in where the gaps comes in the field comes out. This if you understood is the true working of the plasma and the fields which you would created here are exactly the same.<br>你可以将同样的系统用于高磁引力场以作通讯交流的线路。你可以用这些系统为你提供所需要和想要的所用设备。因为你现在弄清楚了这个知识点，而且你会发现这个系统在磁引力场中的美妙之处，即使磁力场也有引力部分。在接受的同时在给予，它在给予的同时也在接受，这就是等离子体运行的方式。出现裂口的地方，磁场可能会进入或出去。如果你明白等离子体的工作原理，那么你创建的磁场就会与之相同。</p>
<p> Exact  plasma in motion, plasma strength and in so many ways a plasma which for the first time you have full control on making the gravitational fully and magnetical fully or creating a gravitational magnetic field that will  it becomes and feels the strength, heavier or lighter. Heavier in mass, in magrav， lighter in mass in magrav and in comparison to another entity heavier or lighter creating gravitation magnetic position which is the target of the space ship program . The space ship program is heading that way.  1:1:40<br>等离子的运动、强度及其方方面面也会是一样的，这是你第一次完全控制引力场和磁力场，或者第一次创建磁引力场，其强度或重或轻，质量变重是由于磁引力场的改变，质量变轻也是由于磁引力场的改变。通过与另一个重一些或轻一些的实体进行参照比较，创建一个磁引力场的位置，这就是宇宙飞船项目的目标。宇宙飞船项目正在朝这个方向发展。<br>As i said you are getting so close into one of you creating a system which is strong enough to show in public about the lift, motion and full control. This gives you a control arm. You decide how which gravitational is required and which one is in the higher. If you want to descend in an angle or you want to descend vertically, or horizontally, or other way to descend.<br>如我所述，你们已经如此接近最终目标了，其中有人可能已经能创建一个强大的系统，向公众展示其飞升、运动和完全控制力。你享有绝对控制权，由你来决定引力场应该有多大强度，如果你想下降，无论是垂直下降还是水平下降或是以任何角度下降，那个引力磁场应该更高一些。<br>Any of you who has worked with these coils and you will see the right order, coating and gassing, any of you is at a point, all of you at that point of collecting to a plasma supply to another not the electron supply. Electron vibration is too weak to do anything to the plasma. This is why the presence science uses MegaWatts wrong for GigaWatts to do the little thing with the power plasma that they can show. Because 1.4 GigaWatts of an electron vibration is a peanut compared to a single plasma in strength. That is why places like CERN, places like what they use to create plasma runs into so much energy intake and very little out because it is peanuts. All they are doing is spinning something up, but not changing the structure but with one coil which you have made and you can follow it through you can achieve more than these top scientists have achieved in these research centres because they work with the peanuts, they work with the crumbs and you start with the full bread.<br>你们任何人有用过线圈的，就会知道正确的顺序进行涂层与甘斯化。每个人都到达这样一个节点，大家都喜欢等离子供给而不是电子供给，电子振动太弱，完全不能与等离子体相抗衡。这就解释了为什么现代科学采用兆瓦而不是千兆瓦来计量小物件的运动。因为与普通的等离子体相比，1.4千瓦的电子振动的强度就像花生。这就是为什么像欧洲核子委员会这样的机构 ， 他们习惯创造等离子体消耗如此多的能量，外部却释放如此少的能量，因为他们用的是花生。他们所做的就是在不改变该物质的结构的前提下，使其自旋，你也可以用一个线圈做到，如果你根据此前学习的方法，你甚至会比研究中心的那些顶尖的科学家做得还要出色，因为他们只与花生或是面包碎屑这样的小东西打交道，而你一开始就是从整体开始。<br>Any questions<br>接下来谁有什么问题吗？<br>[John]: Mr Keshe this is John in british columbia<br>约翰：凯史先生，您好，我是英属哥伦比亚的约翰。<br>Speaker : Yes<br>讲话者：你好。<br>[John]: You had mentioned when the blueprints came out when we started working on the stacker system the horizontal setup, that the spacing between the stackers, between each layer is very important. Is that only apply to the horizontal configuration or as well as applying to a stacker with a vertical configuration<br>约翰：在您刚刚提到的蓝图中，在我们所要构建的栈式存储器系统中，从横向来看，存储器的间距以及每层的间距都非常重要。这一点是仅适用于横向构造还是横向纵向都适用？<br>Speaker: Both ways. This is another way you can make the stackers which are the stackers themselves<br>讲话者：两者都适用。这是你使栈式存储器成为栈式存储器的另一种方式。<br>[John]: I don’t understand the stackers themselves<br>约翰：我不明白成为栈式存储器本身是什么意思？<br>Speaker; No, Now with this system you still can make the tree stackers<br>讲话者：哦，不是。是在当前系统下，你可以创建树状存储器。<br>[John]: but the spacing is going to have to be much greater<br>约翰：那这样的话，空间就会变得更大。<br>Speaker; Yes but the power is much more<br>讲话者：是的，这样的话，能量也会更大。<br>[John]: Okay<br>约翰：好的。<br>Speaker; In a way if you look at it the top stacker and the bottom stacker destabilizes the field as middle stacker is  much easy to control.<br>说话者：在某种程度上，如果你观察上面和底部的栈式存储器会使磁场不平衡或动摇，那么中间的栈式存储器很容易控制。<br>[John]: Okay<br>约翰：好的。<br>Speaker; because you feed it you don’t wait for it to be fed from outside. Because you feed it, you keep the strength in the centre. If you look at it, if it makes sense to you let’s look at it this way.If you look at the structure like oxygen or if you look at the structure like helium. It is a tree stacker and that is why things like helium are stable and inert because the field flow inside creates a condition in the middle that incovers the totality in a field of gravitational magnetic field. The inertness of the gas is due to the balance gravitational magnetic field in the structure just like plasma. Nothing to do with short of  actual one<br>讲话者：因为你为整个系统提供供给，那么就不需要等着从外面获得供给。因为你为其提供动力，所以你就能把磁场强度维持在中心的位置。如果你观察并觉得对你有意义，让我们这样来看，如果你把这个构造看成氧或者氦，这就是树形的栈式存储器。这也解释了像氦这样的物质—稳定，有惰性，因为里面的磁场流在中间创造了一个磁引力场环境，（中间画了一个深色的圈）（周围画了一个大圈，表示中间的磁场流覆盖整个结构而形成的磁引力场环境）这个磁引力场覆盖了整个结构。气体的惰性归因于其结构中磁引力场的平衡，就像等离子结构一样。与其本身没有很大关系。<br>[John]: OKay, 2nd question just a quick one. You mentioned using a plasmatic source instead of using an electron vibration source would be any an array of Alex’s beads be a sufficient source to get the system triggered? or beginning ..<br>约翰：好的。还有一个小疑问。您提到用等离子源代替电子振动源，那有没有有效的阿历克斯的珠子的排列可以启动整个系统？<br>Speaker: Alex’s beads creates certain amounts of plasma, plasmatic conditions<br>讲话者：阿历克斯珠子创建了一定的等离子环境。<br>[John]: OKay Thank you<br>约翰：好的。谢谢您。<br>Speaker: You need to know how you strength in the current and how you strengthen .. you see when you speak about Alex’s beads and then you speak about the current, in that level you think about the current plasma not current electrical<br>讲话者：你需要知道当时的磁场强度多大，以及怎样增强。当你提到阿历克斯珠子的时候，就会想到当前环境，在这种情况下，你首先想的便是当前情况下的等离子而不是电子。<br>[John]:Yes  约翰：嗯，对。<br>Speaker; and it is a big difference. If you look for vibration of the electrons it will not show because it is too powerful but if you do it as one. In a way if you look at Alex’s bead and in what we talked about the split capacitors, it is the same process, it is very much the same process<br>讲话者：这就有很大不同。如果你要找电子振动，它就不会出现，因为其力量太强大。当你观察阿历克斯的磁珠时，和我们之前讨论到了分离电容器，这些过程是相同的。<br>[John]: Yeah just eliminate modal state in the bead, it would eliminate bead  in the electron state correct ?<br>约翰：您刚才排除了磁珠的模态，是否也就排除了电子状态下的磁珠排列？<br>Speaker: Yeah<br>讲话者：是的。<br>[John]: That is what i thought, Thank you.<br> 约翰：我也是这样想的。谢谢。<br>Speaker: you are welcome<br>不用谢。<br>There is a way you can do something very interesting. if you want to work in a total plasma condition even with your split capacitors or your battery that you don’t need the matter state like you use the aluminium foil or you don’t need the gas state of the matter but you can jump up within the fields.<br>还有一种方式挺有趣的。如果你在完全等离子环境中工作，即使有分离式电容器或是电池，不需要任何固体如铝箔或甘斯态的物体，你就能在磁场之间跳跃转换。<br>One of you, i think you know who you are has starting playing with wire sm pipes, you are on the right track but slightly out of line but if you think of it you can sort it out. Where if you choose your wires are slightly different than your tubes  or totally different than your tubes and then when you put the wires in the tubes and the tubes in the bigger tubes, then you will see a huge difference in the performance of the system the power supply and demand of the system.<br>我想有些人开始使用线和管子，方法是对的，但略偏离正确的方向，不过仔细想办法还是可以解决的。在选择线的时候要和管子有些许差别，或完全不同，接下来把线放在管子里，然后再把管子放到更大的管子里，然后你就会发现整个系统的能量供给和需求会有很大不同。<br>[another speaker]; different material wires besides copper or different gauges<br>提问者：是因为使用不同材料的线还是测量仪器的不同？<br>Mr Keshe’:Pardon, Can you speak louder?<br>凯史先生：抱歉，你能再说一遍吗？<br>[Speaker]; different material wires besides copper or different gauges<br>提问者：是因为使用不同材料的线还是测量仪器的不同？<br> Mr Keshe’:I think the man has spoken<br>凯：刚才是有人提问吧？<br>[Speaker]: Yes 提问者：是的。</p>
<p>Mr Keshe : Yes man you can say what you want to say, What gave you that idea to do it<br>凯：好的。你想问什么就问吧。针对你的想法你是怎么做的呢？<br>[Speaker]: I have for a long time .now i  haven’t have got the stuff to do it so i am starting to do it.<br>提问：很久以前，我就在想这个问题。现在有了材料，我要开始试验了。<br>Mr Keshe: Why don’t you choose an aluminium wire and a copper coil and then brass copper wire and plastic coil<br>凯：你可以试试铝线、铜线圈、黄铜线圈和塑料线圈。<br>[Speaker]: Plastic coil ? 提问者：塑料线圈？<br>Mr Keshe: Plastic coils are one of the best energy transfer units they will pass pipes.<br>凯：塑料线圈传递动力的性能非常好,甚至超越管子。<br>[Speaker]: OKay   提问者：好的。<br>Mr Keshe: I see a lot of you are still following monkey see monkey does. go back to what we explained last week about Amos said to me you know what the 。。 has to be when you were talking about water working like magrav i heard a lot of people talking about it on youtube with the rest.  1:11:40<br>凯：我发现很多人还是一味模仿。回顾一下上周阿莫斯讲的应该是什么样的，想想水是怎样像等离子体那样工作的，我听说很多人在YouTube上对此进行讨论。<br>Understand what it means just don’t look at it for what you do, what you wanted out of the water. If you use nanocoat specific types of plastics not just to use plastic pipe, you will get a huge energy release because you work on hierarchy Hydrogen. That is why the body uses sugar C-H bond, none of you have picked up this to use it for your development. Any of you who used by accident plastic in you nanocoating, have already used the energy of the plastic and you don’t play with it. It is a huge amount of energy which can create a huge amount of gravitational field but the hierarchy  hydrogen of whatever the energy which is there , which is carbon - hydrogen bond in plastic. 1:13:40<br>好好想想事情本身的意义，不要盲目寻找你在做的，想想你从水中需要什么。如果你使用纳米涂层的特制塑料管，能量就会大释放，因为你使用了氢气。这就是人体为何用糖分碳氢键，没有人为了开发而使用它。如果谁无意间用了纳米涂层的塑料，并且已借助其能量，就不要与它做游戏玩耍了。它能量巨大足以产生一个强大的磁引力场，塑料中的碳氢键会产生大量的氢气。<br>You are looking to create a gas of C-H. why don’t you nanocoat the plastic and use this part of the structure in your system. why don’t you buy plastic wires and nanocoat them and use them as the copper wire. You have to start opening.  because a lot of you will falling out from now on because intuition is creeping in and a lot of people start doubting their own results their own work they do and they leave it because they don’t understand but everyone of you knows rightly what their doing. Just try to understand the process.<br>如果你在寻找产生碳氢键的甘斯，为什么不把塑料涂上纳米涂层，并将其运用到你的系统中。为什么不买一些塑料线，涂上纳米涂层，然后像铜线那样使用。你必须要开始做，因为很多人之后可能就会放弃，因为人的直觉会不断影响你的工作，很多人开始怀疑实验结果，怀疑他们所做的所有努力，最后将它丢到一边，因为他们不了解，但其实每个人都知道你们在做什么，你们需要努力了解整个过程。</p>
<p>I was explaining to my son yesterday or the day before yesterday that we never die, death is not something to be afraid of, (01.14.48)all we do is we change state of matter. We came from a different state of matter, lived through that state of matter, when we change the position in the state of matter strength that would we are not physically visible at this strength, they call it a death. Why not the celebration of a new cycle. If you understand this, then you can understand very simply what you can do in your process. Convert the simplest energies. don’t go for complicated when you needn’t. To control your capacitors for these coils that you will have don’t look at the gas of titanium, gas of plutonium look at the gas of hydrogen, look at the gas of C-H bond plastic. A lot of it very rapid you can control it.<br>我忘记昨天还是前天给我的儿子解释，我们是永生的，死亡并不可怕，改变的不过是我们所处的形态。我们生前是一种物质状态，出生后是另一种状态生活，如果我们改变自己生前所处环境中的场强度，变得在物理上不可见，于是我们都说这是死亡。为什么不为下一次的重生而庆祝呢？如果你明白了这一点，那么就能很容易明白整个过程你在做什么。在不需要的情况下，转换最简单的能量，不要变得那么复杂。控制好所有线圈的电容器，不要管甘斯态的钛、甘斯态的钚，了解一下甘斯态的氢，了解一下甘斯态的塑料中的碳氢键。那么很快你就能掌控它。<br>Any other question. You are on the right track brad but understand what you are doing<br>还有其他问题吗？你们选择的方法是对的，但需要弄清楚你们正在做什么。<br>[Rick]: There is a question from Arthur who asks, what is the best way to nanocoat plastic, is it still plastic caustic? and the difference between the plastics.<br>瑞克：亚瑟问了一些问题。怎样才能很好地给塑料涂上纳米涂层，它仍具有碱性（腐蚀性）吗？这在不同种类的塑料间有差别吗？<br>Speaker: Caustics used to be one of it. and different plastics create different kind depending on the pressure and how they have been built and, i do not know much about it, i haven’t worked a lot with them, but the more i work with plastic the more i realised i have not understood the work of it.<br>讲话者：以前是有碱性（腐蚀性）的。不同的塑料是有差别的，这要看当时的压力以及他们是怎样被制作的。我对这方面不是很了解，因为我几乎没做过相关实验，不过，我越从事与塑料相关的工作，就越发现自己对这项工作缺乏深入的了解。<br>[Rick]: You did determine the difference in one point in the necks of the coca cola bottles being different than the body of the bottle and they were better for use in some of the experiments for generating hydrogen<br>瑞：你曾总结可口可乐的瓶颈和瓶身的不同点，这对于在一些实验中制造氢气有很大帮助。<br>Speaker: Because it allows you to releases the hydrogen very rapidly.<br>讲话者：因为它可以帮助你迅速释放氢气。<br>[Rick]: and they do use caustic to break down plastic bottle that are hard to break down<br>瑞：人们会用腐蚀剂分解那些难以分解的塑料瓶。<br>Speaker: You don’t break down with caustic what is caustic. Is it  hydrogen,or is it oxygen and has a sodium you have the hydrogen in the plastic. The 2 balances, then if you look at it a lot.of  you have never tested it to see inside you  have the nitrogen, sodium , from the caustic you have the carbon from the plastic and you have the free oxygen from the caustic. have a look what combination it gives you. A lot of Amino Acid ,A lot of free energy already in the shape of wood. In a shape of free energy life, well then we can see the variety of fields you can use to create what you like.<br>讲话者：不是用腐蚀剂去降解，什么是腐蚀剂。是氢，氧还是钠。塑料中含氢，如果你仔细观察，会发现两者是平衡的，大部分的人都没有去验证过。腐蚀剂中有氮、钠，塑料中有碳，还有腐蚀剂中的自由氧离子，好好琢磨一下这个组合，大量的氨基酸，大量的自由能已经存在于食品中，存在于使用自由能的生活中。这样你们会看到你们可以使用不同种类的磁场去创造你们喜欢的任何东西。<br>[Rick]:Okay there is  another question from EMC Square .will different ganses? be  applied to the individual coils or can the or can the same soup of different gases can be applied to all coils 1:19:00<br>瑞：好的。还有一个来自EMC广场的问题，不同的甘斯会应用在单独的线圈中还是可以将同样数量的不同甘斯应用于所有线圈中？<br>Speaker: We explained this before, depends on how you want the coil to perform. We have seen different performances we have seen different characteristics of it. The structure of how you do this you have to start planning things, you have to start making things preplanned and  just getting things then because it is done before you regret.<br>说话者：我们之前就对此进行过解释。这取决于你想让线圈怎样运行。我们曾见过不同性能下的线圈的运动，你要好好计划安排整体架构，你要提前安排因为在你后悔之前已经做好了,不能改动了。<br>[Rick]:Well this<br>瑞：好的，那么。<br>Speaker: We don’t see any much new innovations<br>讲话者：这方面很难有创新。<br>[Rick]:Well that is right and this came up in our discussion in the plasma reactor group. Chandor came in toward the end of the show and then started discussing that we should have a plasma schematic basically or a vision where the plasma is going to flow in our device, whatever  it is<br>It is or we are making, we should have that full vision before we even start to use the physicality to direct it.<br>瑞：确实很对。接下来是等离子反应器组的讨论。向道尔在讨论结束前提出我们应有一个关于等离子体的基本概括，或者等离子体在我们的装置中如何运动的认知，因为无论做什么，在开始使用物质来实验前应该有个整体的了解。<br>Speaker: The thing is if you understand and wanted the visuality of it and so gentleman with the 3 boxes with gases  of different ..which are now part of the Keshe foundation innovation which has now become members of the Keshe foundation like more for the team of innovators and none of who play a role of the month of January. 1:21:00<br>讲话者：关键是如果你想要了解其全貌，带有不同甘斯的3个盒子的人也是凯史基金会追求创新的一部分，现在也已成为凯史基金的一员，凯史基金会更像一个创新的团队，没人能扮演更重要的角色，没有人能控制整个团队。<br>We showed you where the direction is. You want to see how they interact, follow the example put your thing in and move your magnet on the top and see how the bubbles of the gas will fall off, move your gas in a solid container until and move it to one corner and see how the bubbles will be decreased in your side they will be depressed and there will be no bubbles, then you see how everything works.<br>我们已经给大家指明方向，如果你想知道它们是如何相互作用的，就可以按照案例，把各部分添加进去，转动顶部的磁铁，然后看甘斯的泡沫是怎样减少的，把甘斯充入一个固体容器内，测试它，然后把它放在边角上，观察甘斯的泡沫如何在你这边逐渐增加的，然后逐渐减弱，直至没有，这样你便知道整个过程是什么样的了。<br>[Chandor]: Hello it is Chandor here. as I am here I just like to add to what Rick said so 24hours ago or 25 hours ago, it was the Keshe plasma reactor group weekly meeting where we have seen beautiful 3D drawings made by Robert Kavatesian and I just suggested before doing a lot of work for making such a beautiful 3D rendering of the concepts to avoid to do any mistake it is better to understand it by any …<br>向道尔：您好，我是向道尔。我想对瑞克在24或25小时之前说的话进行一些补充，在凯史等离子体反应器的小组会议上，我们欣赏到了Robert的3D绘画，刚刚我只是建议，在为3D绘画进行大量准备工作之前，我们可以先从整体上把握其概念，从而对其有更好的了解，以避免一些错误发生。<br>Speaker: Excuse me if I should stop you there, I am going to stop you there , I know you mean good but I we all never make mistake, we just look at the things our way<br>讲话者：很抱歉在这里打断你。我知道你的出发点是好的。但是我们没有出现过错误，我们只是从我们的角度看问题。<br> [Chandor]: Yes,I meant about the direction of the coils and .difference in one portion and difference in another portion.. there I suggested when you are working with coils who do have an idea about the direction of the flow in the coils. What you want of them before you actually starting wasting the time and material for the working it out , just to have a concept of the idea before just doing a monkey see monkey does copy-paste job<br>Speaker: Even so that was the purpose of what I said yesterday<br>向道尔：是的。我的意思是线圈的方向，各部分都不尽相同，所以我建议使用线圈时，要对线圈内部的能量流动方向有基本把握；在花费精力和物力来完成这项工作前想好你想要什么；在进行模仿实验之前，对整体概念要有一定的了解。<br>说话者：这也就是昨天我所上课程的目的。<br>All : [speaking]<br>[Chandor]: Just to understand understand the flows of the plasma which are behind. 1:23:22<br>向：这样只是为了帮助了解等离子体的运动方向。<br>[Rick]; We were in particular looking at the split capacitor and trying to see I think you had the different winding on the coil and we were trying to envision how that would affect the flow with the give and take of the plasma . There is the picture in question right there<br>Can that be rotated a little bit,John.<br>瑞克：我们主要是在观察分离电容器的情况，你们可能在线圈中有不同的线。我们之前一直在设想如何利用等离子体能量的释放和吸收影响能量流。图中便是我们的问题。约翰，图片可以稍微旋转一下吗？<br>Mr Keshe: Can i try respond to respond to his work of this what you are showing on the screen.<br>凯史先生：我现在能回答屏幕上的这个问题吗？<br>[Rick]; sure of course.<br>瑞：当然。<br>[Mr Keshe]: What about if you put a 3rd coil in between these 2.<br>凯：如果在两个线圈中放入第三个线圈会怎样呢？<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>: Well right now what Robert and i doing, we are just generating models and we, i know, i understand what you are saying,but from what Chandor was saying, all we doing right now is generating models all the different configurations that you could have so you have choice when you want to assemble these devices but a 3rd coil in the centre of this, exactly how would you connect that? What would be the purpose of the 3rd coil other than<br>工作人员：现在，罗伯特和我正在生成模型，我能理解你所说的话，但根据向道尔所说，我们现在做的就是构建不同结构的模型，以便在你想要将这些配置装配到一起时，可供选择。那中间的第三个线圈你打算怎样把他们连接在一起？那第三个线圈的用途又是什么？<br>Mr Keshe]: What is the purpose when we make it 4 coils and on the same stick.<br>凯：如果在同样的条块上放四个线圈，会有什么用途呢？<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>: well if you had 3 coils on the same stick, you could drive all 3 layers of your stacker unit with one device i suppose.<br>工作人员：我想如果你在同一个条块上放三个线圈，就构建了三层栈式存储器，其中就有一个装置。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Yes but going further. what are you dealing with ? Aren’t they the same kind of   the same line in the feedback  on the low side, have you ever thought of that<br>凯：是的。如果更进一步，你接下来要怎么做？它们不是在同一种线圈并在能量反馈的一边吗？难道你没有想过这些？<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>; Strikes me with that, as that could be configured as for lack of a better term and amplifier.<br>工作：您一下就点醒我了。可以改进它的结构做成放大器。<br>[Mr Keshe]: More or less because we take more of one side to the other .What about if you put 2 coils on this, What about if you put 4 coils on this same space<br>凯：或多或少，我们都需要将能量更多的一边向少的一边转移。如果你能在这个条块上放置两个线圈，那么在同样的空间放四个线圈又会怎样呢？</p>
<p>工作人员：正是这样。<br>[Mr Keshe]; so let’s just open the eyes we are looking at a lot of different ways of applying and using these things. In a coming time i will explain to you how can put a plasma through another plasma without a matter condition. Getting there a lot of people will be going that way. I will explain that way i just left it. I just came to touch it but another way we saw  so we slept for what is way    1:26:50<br>凯：我们要打开思维，采用多种方式来应用这些装置。接下来，我会向大家介绍在没有物质的条件下，一个等离子体怎样通过另一个等离子体。很多人都会这样做，我会从之前停下来的地方继续向大家解释。<br>[Rick]:Mr Keshe, I think we need to adjust your microphone a little bit.<br>瑞：凯史先生，您的话筒可能需要调整一下。<br>[keshe]:Yeah,Is it better now? It’s dropping off, it has been too long i think.<br>凯：现在能听清吗？话筒刚才掉了，可能已经掉很久了，我刚刚发现。<br>[Rick]:Yes, I think so.Is there a better microphone for the new year?<br>瑞：我想也是。明年能换个更好用的话筒吗？<br>[Keshe]:We cannot afford it, because it is too…<br>凯：我们可能无力承担，它好像不在我们的计划之内。<br>[Rick]:Yeah, maybe someone will buy it in Christmas as Christmas presents.<br>瑞：嗯，也许会有人把它作为圣诞礼物送给您。<br>[Keshe]:Anyone who like to use the microphone, it’s just that it keeps on moving. The position is as i said earlier on the time to teach, the way we taught up to now is coming to an end. We discuss to inspire and we have seen a lot of inspiration a lot of new people doing new things. I am showing to some officials in the coming week. The true flying system, gravitational magnetical flying system, we are set to do this. That is strange enough, all of you can do it.We are to present the flight system to the, to governments, it will be done in the coming 3,4 weeks. we will not show in public but we will show the technology and leave it to the government to start our project piece for us. The flight system will be shown to the government officials in the coming weeks and i am talking to world leaders not to ordinary people.officials.This is the cause we done.<br>凯：谁想用麦克风，它总在动。现在教这些还有些早，到现在课程即将进入尾声。我们不断地去讨论，从而激发人去思考，而且确实有很多新鲜力量加入为我们带来更多新的体验。接下来的一周，我会向一些官员展示我们的飞行系统、磁引力飞行系统，这是我们的使命。奇怪的是，你们每个人都可以这样做。我们将在接下来的三到四周内，向政府展示我们的飞行系统。但这个不会向公众公开，但我们会向政府展示我们的技术成果，然后继续我们的项目。最近几周，我会向领导人介绍我们的飞行系统而不是普通官员。这是我们已经在做的。<br>[Rick]: There is a Douglas here who says he has achieved lift of a small iron object but i don’t think that is the kind of lift that you are talking about. Maybe we should hear more from Douglas<br>瑞：有个叫道格拉斯的人说他能让小铁片飞升起来，但我觉得他说的意思好像跟您讲的不太一样。我们可以看看他是怎么做的。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Is Douglas the gentleman in this generation.<br>凯：道格拉斯是这批人中的那个年轻人吗？<br>[Rick]; I don’t know he just made a comment in the chat and , he said yes that is me, do you want to speak perhaps<br>瑞：我不太清楚。他只是在评论区里留言了。他说那是他。您想跟他聊一聊吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe] : yeah sure, we don’t go for secrecy. if he speaks let him speak but douglas have you spoken to your boss.<br>凯：当然。这不用保密。如果他有要说的就让他讲。但是，道格拉斯，你有向上级报告吗？<br>[Rick]; You cannot mute there Douglas if you want to speak, there he is<br>瑞：道格拉斯，你那边没有声音。如果你想跟凯史先生讨论，他就在这里。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Because he works with a reddit on the innovation side (01.29.50)<br>凯：因为他在创新版块那里<br>[Rick]; Do you want to say something there Douglas ?<br>瑞：道格拉斯，你有什么要说的吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Can you show us Douglas what you are talking about ?<br>凯：你能向我们介绍一下你要说什么吗？<br>[Douglas]; （01.30.04）I have it on a video that was listed on my youtube channel, but it was there a few days ago. It was piece of iron ferrite i think i explained to Renin about this and i didn’t know if i could, anyway the Iron ferrite accidentally which was just a chip, i accidentally dropped it down in  my solution gans and i reached in and i grabbed it with pair of stainless steel surgical forceps and i noticed an immediate attraction at an unbelieveable distance almost as it lifted up out of my solution to attract itself to the forceps and i thought that was odd being that they were stainless steel. i know there is 3 different types of stainless steel and each one of them have a different reaction but i placed the object in front of a Preyyer pliers needle nose bar  far which i know where iron and there wasn’t any or was a little magneticity there but that was nowhere near the attraction so i tried it again with the forceps, it didn’t work it went to like 5-7mm before it move the object again so i redid the scenario process on the camera, i dropped it in the solution picked it back up with the forceps and that time started the procedure over again and this time the forceps could make an interaction and make the piece of iron ferrite moving in each direction i wanted to at 20mm away but we are talking about a small piece of iron ferrite, i mean it was just a small piece but i get the concepts of what is gonna be used for<br>道格拉斯：几天前，我在Youtube上上传了一段视频。我已经向瑞克解释了，它是一块铁素体，我不知道自己可以完成这个操作。这个铁素体只是是一块铁薄片，不小心掉到甘斯溶液（solution=溶液）里面，后来用不锈钢外科医用手术钳把它捡起来，后来我发现在相当远的距离中，有一种即时的相互吸引（指的是手术钳与铁素体之间），铁素体自己被手术钳吸引起来。我当时觉得很奇怪，因为手术钳是不锈钢的。我知道有三种类型的不锈钢，而每种都会有不同反应。不过，我在尖嘴钳的前面放了一个铁片，因为都是铁制的，但两者（尖嘴钳与铁片）不能吸引到一起，因此，我又用了手术钳，但没有成功，直到两者距离接近5-7mm处，才有吸引作用。于是，我用相机把整个过程拍了下来，我把铁片又放到甘斯溶液里面，然后用手术钳把它拾起来，整个过程又重复了一遍，这一次，手术钳与铁薄片相互作用，手术钳可以使铁素体向各个方向移动。我还想增加两者的距离到20mm的地方，但它只是一片很小的铁素体，不过这也足够我们去了解这个概念了。<br>[Mr Keshe]: is it still on your youtube or you took it down . Can you show us the picture or the video?<br>凯：这个视频还在你的Youtube列表里吗？还是你已经把它删除了。你可以给我们看下图片或是视频吗？<br>[Douglas];（01.32.12） It is still on the youtube but there is particular warn there is  nothing revealing to it, in other words there is nothing that somebody nobody would see that they would cause an issue, it is just me with a micrometer and drawing some lines out in millimeters out on a piece of paper and show the interaction between the iron ferrite and needle nose pliers and also the forceps.It would have been one of a light issue to the video because i wont be making anymore videos. Since becoming a part of the foundation.<br>道：它还在我的视频列表里，不过有提醒说它并不能说明什么，也就是没有人能从中得到任何结论。我只是在一张纸上用千分尺画了几条几毫米的线，用以解释铁素体和尖嘴钳、手术钳之间的相互作用。这只是一个小视频，在我加入基金会后，就不会再上传任何视频。<br>[Rick]: If you wanted you could play your video on your screen and share it with us, if that is okay<br>瑞：如果可以，你能不能把视频放出来，让我们看一下？<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>;  If you have a local copy play that one rather than download it again and upload it, all at the same time.<br>工作人员：你有没有一个本地副本，而不用同时再次下载和上传。<br>[Douglas]; local copy… this is the one thing i am not good at the computer thing, i can build them, i can tear them apart and turn them into bit but this whole knowledge it takes to get over to Youtube and put that on this page, that i like<br>道：副本，我不是很会用电脑进行这样的操作，我可以创建它，可以将其分离，解剖，不过我所知道的就只是关于Youtube的，所以我喜欢将它上传到网页上，<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>; Can you provide the link to Rick, he can do that,<br>工作人员：你能把链接给瑞克吗？他懂这些操作。<br>[Douglas]; Yeah Rick did it the other day he pulled up one of my pages cast out in 1969 in Yahoo. com on youtube<br>道：好的。瑞克之前这样做过。他曾把我的页面放在Youtube上的1969.Yahoo.com.<br>[Rick]:  let me try to find it again there.<br>瑞：让我再试一下。</p>
<p>[Douglas]; It would be the one labeled magnetic anomaly in nickel gans. Mr Keshe you still there.<br>道：是那个在镍甘斯目录里面标记为磁场异象的视频。凯史先生，你现在还在吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes<br>凯：在。<br>[Douglas]: Because i got a question regarding something,making the CO2 gas same formula since day one and i have quite some production of some beautiful white CO2 gas .<br>The thought It has not come to me last night why don’t I not add CO2 to the mixture, so I made my own home made generator of sugar, yeast, water and rice and generated my own CO2 mixture through tubing down to the same nano coated plated with a zinc plate and I have not yet produced any white substance, since it is all a rusty coloured substance but at the bottom of the hose where the CO2 bubbles are coming out .I have solid chunks of white mass that looks like CO2 gas<br>道格拉斯：(01.34.26)我有一个关于制造二氧化碳气体的问题，第一天开始使用同样的配制方法，现在已经有一些很完美的白色二氧化碳甘斯生成物。昨天晚上，我突然想到为何不把二氧化碳加入混合物中。于是，我把糖、酵母、水和米放入家庭自制的发生器中，生成的二氧化碳混合物通过管道与有同样纳米涂层的锌板接触，但却没有产生白色物质，仅仅是个铁锈色的生成物，不过在软管下端有二氧化碳气泡产生，之后好像是二氧化碳甘斯固化生成白块。<br>[Mr Keshe]; No you are producing zinc oxide and partially you are producing calcium in the water.<br>凯：不是的，最后生成的是氧化锌，水中的部分生成物是钙。<br>[Douglas]; But we need the Zinc Oxide right?<br>道：但是我们需要氧化锌的，对吗？<br>[Mr Keshe]; Yeah but what it is if you, I am going to go back into something which goes back to the physiology and into chemistry and biology and the whole process.<br>凯：是的。如果我是你的话，我会要再回想一下整个过程中物理、化学和生物的相关知识。<br>[Douglas]; That’s what we thought at first too, but because we thought that the zinc structure from the iron was coming through but you can tell the zinc structure is not even been altered. it is still just as shiny as it was, There is no rust or rust colouration<br>道：最初我也是这样想的。因为我们都认为锌和铁结构不会发生反应，锌结构不会发生改变，依然会闪闪发光，没有铁锈或铁锈色。<br>[Mr Keshe]; you don’t see it that way but on the other hand when you get the white residue at the bottom , It’s not much of it, it’s just a block of it?<br>凯：你还没有看明白，但是另一方面在管子底部也得到了白色沉淀物，量不大，但也有一块吧？<br>[Douglas]; Yeah where I moved the hose, where ever I moved the CO2 hose I will end up with a little white ball at the end of the CO2 hose.<br>道:是的，当我移动装有二氧化碳软管的时候，都会发现有白色团块。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Do you understand what is the atomic mass of calcium?<br>凯；你知道什么是钙的原子质量吗？<br>[Douglas]: No I don’t understand it, I have been mess of it. I will have to look it up.<br>道：我不知道。我有点混乱了，接下来我会好好补足这方面的知识。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Can we see your video and then we go?<br>凯：我们现在可以看你上传的视频了吗，然后我们再继续讨论？<br>[Rick]: Excuse me.Can you give me the name again? It’s what 1969.<br>瑞：抱歉，可以把名字再给我说一遍吗？是什么1969啊？<br>[Douglas]; yeah cast iron 1969;<br>道：掷铁1969<br>[Mr Keshe]; so if you go back on a calcium, go back on the zinc,  go back on the CO2 and if somebody tells us what the atomic mass of the calcium is on the periodic table.<br>凯：（01.36.57）当你回想钙，锌、二氧化碳的原子质量时，有人会说钙的原子质量就在元素周期表里。<br>[Douglas]; I can give you zinc but I don’t have calcium now, I can pull up the chart<br>道：我可以告诉你锌的原子质量，但我不知道钙的，我去查一下周期表。<br>[Someone]; 40 calcium is 40;  1:37:00<br>某人：钙是40.<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yes I am awake was getting away.<br>凯：嗯，我刚刚不在。<br>[Someone]; I sent you an email<br>某人：我给您发了封邮件。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Yes I saw it,I didn’t ignore it I haven’t had time to read it yet<br>凯：嗯，我看见了。我没有忘，只是还没有时间阅读。<br>[Rick]: Okay I have got the video setup here, let me do a screen share on that<br>瑞：（01.38.03）好的。我现在已经把视频打开了，等下放在屏幕上。<br>[Douglas]; yeah it is not a very long one this time<br>道：这个视频比较短。<br>[Rick]; Should I play it, it’s 6 minutes, 7 minutes right.<br>瑞：现在需要播放吗？大概是6到7分钟。<br>[Douglas]: Yeah it not a very long one<br>道：是的，它比较短。<br>[Rick]; So should I play sound on it?<br>瑞：需要放出声音吗？<br>[Douglas]; There is nothing there I don’t play music in it or anything, so it’s me describing what is going on<br>道：视频里没有配乐或其他声音，只有我在一直解说。<br>[Rick]; I should play that then or else you can describe it, you should be able to see it there, let us 0 in on the live screen. Okay that is it.<br>瑞：我把它放出来，这样你可以解说，你现在应该能看到，现在好了。<br>[from the video]; Hey Everybody Cast-iron here, its December the 16th still 9pm at night, I have just discovered this and I wanted to share it with you guys let me see if I can get down here to the micro level so you can see, this is scaled off exact 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 millimetres lines and this is a piece of the magnetron magnet. Now earlier, accidentally, I was messing around and dropped that small piece into the nickel gans, it went straight to the bottom if it and I have a pair of forceps here haemostats some of us call them you clearly see here let me back up so you guys can see, forceps, haemostats whatever you want to call them and as soon as I got near the water, this thing leapt up out of the nickel gans and attached itself to this stainless steel surgical stainless steel instrument. Pretty amazing on its own. These little pliers here are magnetic I will show you 25, 20, 15, 10 millimetre we still have no reaction, just a tiny bit of a field reaction at 10 millimetre, we get up at 5 it will attach itself so you can see it is clearly magnetic, now I have to do it again and drop it in the gans it seems like, it seems like I do, it seems like I have the last time so this may not do it this time I may have to drop it in the gans in front of you and repeat the process ok at  25millimetres , 20 millimetres, 15millimetres actually bit , there it’s on the line, 15 millimetres , about 10 a little less than 10 okay. Now then watch this I will drop over here in, let me see, watch me drop it in there the, not seeing where it landed, I will race down here and pick thing up, it attached to it instantly, from out of the water. I will dry, dry it off here real quick, it and my tool which is surgical stainless steel which didn’t know had magnetic properties such as those anyway, we gone put that right back on the line and once again we will come, 25, 20, 15 and we are at 10 nothing is happening this time at 10 as you can see we get in closer 7 and a half still nothing happening we get in around 5, still nothing happening. Now then  25, 20, 15, usually around is where I start seeing it move around 13 right there, 10, 5 and it flipped. That is what it is, it’s the poles. Ok so there is the poles that’s the pole that is attracted right there, it is kind of hard to define a pole on this thing it’s a shiver now, let’s try this again, 25 so we know at 15 at 10 we got a reaction, not much of a reaction , now it starting to move at about 7, 8 you can see it is moving a little bit we put it back there on the line about 7 or 8 and did you see the thing move as soon as just, look here all the way back here. I hope you all are picking that up. Don’t ask me to explain that other than somehow or another the gans has made some kind of magnetic link of between these 2, this is a, look here all way back at 20 if you go up above it spirals you see back here at 20 you don’t get jack shit nothing. I just thought I would share that with you, that was dropped in the nickel gans just one of the other tests I’ve done that is truly amazing going to have to do some more testing with more magnets and different strengths and other things this is an anomaly I don’t think has been brought up yet anyway peace and blessing to each and every one of you. Thank you Mr. Keshe and thank you all knowledge seekers throughout the world.</p>
<p>[end of video]<br>（01.38.55）大家好，这里是铸铁视频，今天是十二月九号，已经晚上九点了，我刚刚发现了这个，想与你们分享。我先看看能不能把这个调小，可以让你们看清楚些，好了，你们可以看到我已经缩小到正好指向5、10、15、20、25毫米了，这是一片磁控管磁铁，早前我在摆弄东西的时候一不小心把这个小磁铁片掉到了镍甘斯缸里，它径直落到了底部。这里有一副镊子，也有人称它为止血钳，我退后一点，你们可以清楚地看到，我拿着钳子一靠近甘斯水溶剂，小磁铁就会立刻从镍缸中弹出来，吸附在医用不锈钢仪器上，很神奇吧！这些镊子是有磁性的，你们可以看到，当尖嘴指向25、20、15、10毫米的时候它毫无反应，（钳子不断靠近小磁铁）只是指到10毫米的时候有微小的反应，（距离10MM）当我们调到5毫米的时候它就吸住了，所以我们知道它是有磁性的，所以我得再做一遍，就像我上一次我把它丢到甘斯溶剂里一样，一样，重复这一过程，现在是25毫米，20毫米，接近15毫米，正好指到15毫米，接近10毫米，但还没到10毫米，继续，（吸住，在7CM-8CM左右位置）现在看好，我要把它放进去了，（把小磁铁放到甘斯溶剂里）看着我把它放进去，不要看它掉到哪了，我会放慢速度，把它捡起来，（用钳子放入溶剂里面），我去把它捡起来，它立刻吸附上去了，我拿出水面。我马上把它弄干，（毛巾弄干）我的医用不锈钢仪器还不清楚是不是有磁性，我把它归位，重新来一次，25，20，15，现在到10毫米了，毫无反应，你们可以看到，但7.5的时候仍然没有反应，，5CM，还是没有反应，然后25，20，15，（又重来），接近13的时候，它动了一下，10，5，它弹了一下，好了，找到电极了，像这样的东西很难找到电极，现在它是一个铁片。好了，我们再试一次，现在是25，我们知道在15和10的时候有微小反应，现在我们移动到7和8，我们看到它有细微的移动，（动了一下，01.43.56）我们再把钳子返回，（返回到15CM-20CM之间，在空中时磁铁动了）到7和8，看，它立刻就动了。我希望你们都理解了。让我们回到20CM的距离在空中做螺旋状的运动，（螺旋运动），但没有什么反应。这些应该都不用解释，不过甘斯使两者之间产生磁场连接，这是因为看，如果它呈螺旋上升运动，所有的都会回到20CM这里，到了20CM之后就没有任何反应了，我觉得应该让你们看看这是怎么回事，它掉进镍甘斯里，这是我之前的一个实验，之后还会用更多磁铁和不同磁场强度做实验。这种现象很奇怪，可能还没有人发现。不管怎样，希望大家安好。感谢您，凯史先生，感谢所有的知识探寻者[Rick] : Is the there anything else you want us to see  right away there.<br>瑞：还有其它让我们看的东西吗？</p>
<p>[Douglas]; No that was just about it in the magnetic anomaly i have been concentrating on work on another project, I still got the magnet out, but i just haven’t had time to play poly with them a whole lot.<br> 道：没有了。这就是我所说的关于磁力异常现象。我一直都在做其他项目，虽然我仍在收集磁铁，但却没有时间将他们聚到一起（做实验）。<br>[Rick]; okay thank you<br>瑞：好的，谢谢。<br>[Mr.Keshe] What would be interesting is go back and find the same kind of magnets 2 of them, and keep one away from nano material and nano ganses and ones you see if you have the same effect.<br>凯：比较有趣的是回去找两块相同的磁铁，一个远离纳米材料，另一个进行纳米甘斯化，然后两个对照看是否有相同的效应。<br>[Douglas]; i was using the needle nosed pliers and iron and surgical stainless steel<br>道：我用的是尖嘴钳、铁和医用不锈钢手术刀。<br>[Mr Keshe]; depends on who made the steel and where it is made if it had some iron in it. because stainless steel it depends on how they roll it. So you can try to buy the same pair of, i think a lot people can test this we will see what is the outcome.<br>凯：这要看不锈钢是谁做的，哪里生产的，其中是否含铁，因为不锈钢取决于制作者是怎么卷的。所以，你们可以买完全一样的进行实验，根据其他人的实验情况，看看结果如何。<br>[Rick]; You could see if a magnet attaches to the pliers there, not the pliers but the other pinchers, the forceps. Because if a regular magnet doesn’t stick to them. there is definitely something odd going on down there.<br>瑞：如果你发现一块磁铁吸到尖嘴钳，不是尖嘴钳而是夹锭钳或是外科专用手术钳，那就比较奇怪了，因为磁铁一般不会和它们粘在一起。<br>[Douglas] That is what i am saying i have had them for years, i use them in all sorts of applications holding electronic devices, little small wires when i am soldering them together. i have never noticed a magnetic reaction that is why i was laughing. Not once have i noticed a magnetic reaction and in any a time that i have never used those forceps, i have 2 pairs, one of them is a little bigger but they are both German surgical stainless steel, well i don’t know that makes any difference Dad was a chemical engineer he says there is 3 different types of surgical stainless steel and he said one of them does not have magnetic properties. I don’t know that is out of my element<br>道：这正是我想说的。这些东西跟了我很多年，无论要做什么，我都会用这些东西：帮助我掌控电子设备、小电线或焊接东西。我之前未曾注意到磁性反应，所以才觉得比较有趣。事实上，之前我不止一次见过这种现象，但却从未用手术钳去实验。我有两把手术钳，有一把比较大，但都是德国造的外科专用不锈钢手术钳，而且也没觉得有不同。我的父亲是化学工程师，他经常说有三种外科专用不锈钢手术钳，其中一把没有磁性，但我不知道我的手术钳是什么材质。<br>[Rick]; Just try a magnet and just if it attracts to it that would tell you<br>凯：找一块磁铁试试，如果能够吸引，就证明它具有磁性。<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>; Me and Vince did this a year and half ago we got the gans and dried them out and got stuff stuck there around, you don’t even need a stainless steel you can get do it with straws and wood and you see the interaction with the pieces of gans with it, spin around and fly off and get recharged and repelled to different material.<br>甲：(01.48.29)我和文斯一年半前就用了甘斯，我们把它弄干，在其周围放置一些填充物，不需要用不锈钢，你可以用稻草和木材与甘斯相互作用，不同材料旋转、飞驰、也相互排斥。<br>[Rick]: you could have used you hands , you hands were, your hands were able to do it too<br>瑞：你本可以用你的双手去做的，手也可以完成这项工作。<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>; That is what i am thinking it is basically the gans that’s creating the field there, is that basically what you are saying because that is what i am feeling too.<br>Man：我看，基本上是甘斯创建了磁场。<br><a href="Exactly">Man</a>; I think there is a bunch of videos somewhere of what we did.<br>甲：我们好像制作了很多相关的视频。<br>[Rick]; I think it is different than magnetic because a magnet was making what you are talking about, Brad and Vince, a magnet was making about the same thing. The difference is using hand, a hand could make a more difference than the magnet it’s certainly.<br>瑞：我觉得这可能与磁性有些不同。因为磁铁也可以做布莱德和文斯提到的工作，它做的都是同样的事情，不同之处在于使用手，使用手当然会和磁铁有很大区别。<br>[Douglas]: Exactly it could contain both properties, both attractive and repulsive yes exactly<br>道：是的，确实是这样的。它有两方面的属性，既会吸引也会排斥。<br>[Rick]; What else do we have here? is there more comments about that ? I have got Ali here who has his video about a madgrave star formation, maybe we could have a look at that.<br>Okay let us see what we have here. Let me get that set up and.<br>瑞：(01.49.31)我们这边还有什么问题吗？还有其他评论吗？我这边有个叫阿里的，他有个关于磁引力场-星型组合的视频，我们可以看一看。让我看一下，我们这边有什么，然后把它放出来。<br>[Mr. Keshe] Before we go to that, can we explain why some of you get like blocks of white stuff at the bottom and you don’t understand what it is because a lot of you have seen it, a lot you report what  is the difference between C02 and  zinc oxide.<br>凯：在我们看视频前，要不我们先来解释下为什么你们会在管子底部发现一些白色固体，可能有人还不是很清楚，因为很多人都发现了，也有很多人在讨论二氧化碳和氧化锌的区别。<br>[Rick]; That is an important point that you have got to clarify.<br>瑞：这个知识点很重要，还请您帮我们梳理清楚。<br>[Douglas]: The way i understand you Mr Keshe the zinc oxide has a orangish colour, no.<br>道：凯史先生，在我看来，（不同之处在于）氧化锌是橙色的。<br>[Mr Keshe] No Zinc oxide is always white orange you don’t get a zinc oxide it is white in the gans state the orange color is mainly C-H<br>凯：不是的。氧化锌通常是白色，你不会见到甘斯状态下白色的氧化锌，而橙色通常是碳氢键的作用。<br>[Douglas]; okay so zinc oxide is white,  it would be similar to the CO2 gans<br>道：所以，氧化锌是白色的，与二氧化碳甘斯很相似。<br>[Mr Keshe] Yes but it is a slightly different white<br>凯：是的。但是白的程度还是有些不同。<br>[Douglas]; cause i did that with aluminum and i obtained another one that is almost white but it is aluminum<br>道：因为我是用铝来做的实验，然后我就发现另一个也差不多是白色的，但那是铝。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Aluminum is a gooey white, the one where you get the luckiest substance at the bottom when you make the CO2 can i share the, what do you call it okay.<br>凯：铝是胶白色。现在让我来向大家分析一下，你做二氧化碳实验时，从管子底部拿到的残留物是什么。<br>[Douglas]; Okay let me write these down.<br>道：好的，我要把它记下来。<br>[Mr Keshe]; What you see  here Zinc oxide is ZnO2 you have 60+16+16 which is 92. If you look at when you have the zinc oxide and you have the plates inside where you are creating a carbon 40+40+12, These 2 become molecular gans of calcium plus the carbon. Which that carbon becomes partially CO2 and this molecular calcium gans, this is the solid bit at the bottom of your body, at the bottom of your container.<br>你看到的氧化锌其实是二氧化锌，也就是锌的原子质量与两个氧的原子质量相加（60+16+16），总数为92. 当产生氧化锌时，其内部的锌板在化学反应中生成碳，也就是两个钙分子与碳的原子质量相加40+40+12，总数为92.（01.52.26）这两个（2个40）变成了钙的甘斯分子加上一个碳，其中部分碳已转化为二氧化碳，而这个分子状态的钙甘斯则是你容器中剩余的固体。<br>This is how calcium is created is created in the body of the man for the bone structure. Partially the difference when the people who can not digest milk or cannot take calcium in the body or when you have a calcium loss or soft bone tissue. Doctors look at the wrong side of the thing. You can compensate it with the zinc and you can do that very very easily with the conversion of the zinc to calcium.<br>这就是人体骨骼中的钙是怎样产生的。对于有的人不能消化牛奶、身体不能吸收钙、钙流失或者得软骨病这就可能有些区别。医生经常是看到事情错误的一面。其实，你可以用锌来弥补钙缺失，或是通过简单的方式将锌转换为钙。<br>This is what the oyster does, this is what the sea fish does, what you call it shell fish do. That is why they absorb so much zinc from the bottom of the of the sea, because they go through the same process,it has never been understood so add to the knowledge. You understand now. They absorb the zinc , they store the zinc in combination with the presence of the carbon which is part of the breathing system which they use. They produce calcium,  that is how the shell of the sea shell fishes are created.<br>（01.53.44）牡蛎就是这样做的，海鱼也是这样做的，水生贝壳类动物也是这样做的，这就是它们从海底吸收大量的锌的原因，因为它们也要经历同样的过程，这也是之前从未涉及到的知识，现在你们应该了解了。它们吸收并储存锌，与参与呼吸系统的碳相结合，从而生成钙。这就解释了海洋贝壳类生物的壳是如何产生的。<br>And that is why for example oyster has white what we call shell. It is the calcium conversion where there is the CO2 created inside using zinc for the creation of calcium which becomes the shell of the fish. That is how you produce these blocks at the bottom of your pot wherever you have the zinc. You literally produce oyster shell or the bone structure which we have in the body of the man. This has never been known now maybe you understand adding to the knowledge.<br>（01.54.20）这就解释了牡蛎的壳是白色的，这就是钙的转换，二氧化碳与锌反应生成钙也就是水生贝壳类生物的壳。这就是为什么在含有锌的瓶底会产生白块。这就直接解释了牡蛎壳和人体骨骼产生的原因，此前我们可能不知道这一点，但现在应该都能理解。<br> We see a lot of people say i produce zinc oxide, when most of the time whenever you see white solids at the bottom of your pot you are creating zinc oxide, because the zinc oxide leads to the creation of the calcium  which is bottom of the molecular structure gans of calcium. That is actually sheets of mole, ganses of calcium which is stuck as a molecule and stays together on nano layer ,？so true nano layer of material, the same as you make with the nano coated copper.<br>很多人都说他们做实验产生的是氧化锌，在大多数情况下，你们看到的瓶底的固体正是氧化锌，氧化锌从而生成钙，钙也就是钙甘斯分子结构的底部。由氧化锌生成的钙就像钙甘斯的防护提，而钙甘斯成为分子状态并集合在纳米层中，所以真正的纳米涂层就像你做的纳米铜一样。<br>Those of you who index the teaching. Maybe you index that how the shell of the animals are created. Where it comes from zinc to calcium in the gans state. Thank you very much for bring this up, i have trying to teach this for a long time, but keep forgetting that i teach some people but i explain they say , whenever you see solid residue you have used a high power you did not put a filter like a  LED light on it. So what you have done i  have explained it before, what you have done is when you put your copper outside and zinc plate in, the current flow of which when then 2 you tie it up together. 99% you are making zinc oxide. If you take a lot and put LED light into a motor or a LED light, everything that they don’t like, it don’t need to be a sin, let you create CO2.<br>做课程索引的人也就可以找到动物的壳是怎样产生的。它是在甘斯状态下从锌转换成钙的。谢谢你提出这个问题，我一直都想给大家讲这个知识点，但总是忘记。当我给一些人讲的时候，他们却说，当你看到固体残留物时，是因为当时能量过高，你没有放一个带有LED灯光的过滤器。那么接下来你该怎么做呢，正如我之前讲过的把铜放在外面，锌板放在里面，当把两者连接起来的时候产生能量流动，那么99%的可能会生成氧化锌。如果你产生了较多的氧化锌，安装一个LED灯连上马达，你就会生成CO2。<br>That is why as i said before in the couple of weeks past teaching, the new and the CO2 plates and the CO2 kits which are dipped in the Keshe foundation manufacturing italy from next week. all have an LED light it is because it is a CO2 kettle. If you want produce zinc oxide take the LED out and just connect the 2 wires together and close all connections. Wherever you see these residue solid bits at the bottom, you produce calcium exactly like oyster, like the bone of the man. One of the sections of the bone of the man, is the way man creates bone, the bone structure is the use of the zinc,because zinc is connected to the emotional part and the bone structure producing an immune system ,is to guarantee the survival of the emotional part in the blood which it creates.<br>（01.56.45）这就是我前几周说过的，从下周起，新的二氧化碳包会进入凯史基金意大利制造中心，所有的都将会有LED灯光，因为这是一个二氧化碳容器 。如果你想制造氧化锌就把LED拿出来，像图中那样，将两条线连接在一起，然后关闭所有连接。当你看到瓶底有固体残留物时，便产生了钙，这就像牡蛎壳和人体骨骼一样。人体骨骼的产生，是骨架中含有锌，因为锌与人的情感相关联，因此骨骼是人的免疫系统，确保血液所产生的精神活动的有效进行。<br>So zinc is part of the essential part. It is a glue, it is a , what is the word for it. It is an agent, a catalyst, when you create a field of zinc for the creation of calcium in the bone of the man or creating the bone structure, because it carries part of the emotion with it.<br>OKay can we see the next video.<br>因此，锌是很关键的一部分，它是一种胶合物，有个词怎么说的，是代理人，催化剂，在人体的骨骼或骨架中，有大量的锌转换为钙，因为它有携带一些情感因素。好的，让我们来看看下一个视频吧。<br>[Rick]; Thank you for that clarification we need to show here. oops.<br>瑞：很感谢您用刚才那段时间将这一知识点梳理清楚。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Is this the video from Ali ?<br>凯：这是阿里的视频吗？<br>[Rick]; Yes, let me make it a little bigger so you can see it netter.<br>瑞：是的。稍等一下，我来把它放大，这样看得更清楚一些。<br>[Mr Keshe]; How did it go with the stacker manufacturing system<br>凯：他是怎样完成这个栈式存储器制作工程的。<br>[Rick]; Its not clear on what exactly he is doing right now maybe he can tell us;<br>不知道他现在在做什么。如果他在应该会向我们解释清楚的。<br>[Ali]; Hi Mr Keshe and yeah this is the stacker that i built again about 15 stackers in total, i was very busy last week and i created a star formation and i was experiment with, today and when i dim the light i see, it has to be pretty dim but i see shimmers underneath and I do see like shapes and it is kind of like a tin glass that moves so it like a misty vapor around a unit when i move my hand or something so it’s creating this field around.<br>阿里：你好，凯史先生。这就是我用15个存储器（周围各三层，中间6层）做的系统。我上周非常忙，做了一个星型组合，一直在实验。当我把灯光调暗时，必须要非常暗，于是我看到下面有微光（闪光），同时能看到它具有形状，它就像移动的锡杯，把我的手放在这里就也感觉像是有雾气环绕一个单元，我想这里可能创造了一个环绕的磁场。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Let me stop you there, you have created the first lift system (01.59.56)<br>[Ali]: Yes<br>凯：我要稍微打断你一下。你制造了第一个飞升系统？！<br>阿里：是的。<br>[Mr Keshe]:You have created the first lift structure of the UFO or what you call the space ship. If you see the shimmer it is the way you stacked them the way it is, i explained that in the last teaching you have done what i explained stacking it the way it is on the last teaching of last week so you have to adjust the field flow and you will see our UFO or your spaceship. Do you see the shimmer floating or vibrating?<br>凯：你制造了第一个类似UFO或宇宙飞船的飞升系统，你把它们叠加在一起，看到几点微弱的光，这就是按照上周课程中我讲的那种叠加方式，然后你只要调整磁场流，就会看到UFO或飞船结构。你能看到微光在浮动或摆动吗？<br>[Ali]: There is movement so when i look at it even see rotation of the field so what i did i made sure that i have different ganses, so i am,..<br>阿里：现在是有些运动，当我看到磁场旋转，我就能确定是不同的甘斯在起作用。<br>[Mr Keshe]:You have achieved what we said, actually part of the structure we showed or did it in the coming time and that is why taught it that for people to understand but i don’t use the way you use the stackers, we are using 5 magrave systems.<br>凯：你已经做到我们之前讲到的内容，以及部分是接下来我们要介绍的，这就要让你们能够理解，不过我不像你那样使用存储器，我们要构建5个磁引力系统。<br>[Ali]: OKay<br>阿里：好的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: i taught this last 2 week when i talked about you put one stacker on top of the other you have done exactly how it should be done. Control you energy you will start seeing the first UFO, I told you somebody will do it before but forget those you are close.  as birth surprise.<br>（02.02.22）两周前，我讲的把一个存储器放在另一个上面，你正是这样做的，控制动力，你就能看到UFO结构，可能有的人会先做这个，作为生日惊喜。<br>[Ali]: It is interesting because today is my birthday<br>好巧，今天恰好是我生日。</p>
<p>[Mr Keshe]:Happy Birthday try to start powering it though power supply, try to power it through plasma capacitors or batteries. You will see the first UFO and you have done it exactly the right time<br>凯：生日快乐。打开电源，开始为系统提供动力，你可以用等离子电容器或等离子电池。这样你就能看到第一个UFO，你现在做正是时候。<br>[Ali]: So what i did， i made some powder from the quartz crystal and i 3 types of gas, one was CO2 CH3 and the other one was the heavier one, i put the dust of the crystals in the gans and i coated the stacker with the dust of the gans and the quartz crystals  and then run some…<br>阿里：我研磨了一些石英晶体的粉末，用到3种甘斯，CO2、CH3和一个比较重的甘斯，我把石英晶体粉末放入甘斯中，再把这些粉末涂在存储器外，然后…<br>[Mr Keshe]:Do you have the system running now ?<br>凯：现在系统正在运行吗 ？<br>[Ali] Yes .<br>阿里：是的。<br>[Mr Keshe]:Can you go on camera if you can show it i want to have a look at something<br>凯：请把镜头对着系统，我想好好观察一下。<br>[Ali]; i have to either move my computer or bring it over here. I can bring it over here hold on<br>阿里：我要移动我的电脑或是把它拿过来，好的，等一下，我把它拿过来吧<br>[Mr Keshe]: do you want me to give you a time and come back in 5 minutes if you want<br>凯：给你留些时间吧，5分钟可以吗？<br>[Ali]; I can bring it in a minute it’s just gonna take a second hold on<br>阿里：我很快就能拿过来，稍微等一下。<br>[Mr Keshe]:That would be interesting to see if your shimmer has a dome, if you shimmer has a dome you will achieve the first UFO structure<br>凯：如果微光上有个圆顶，一定会很奇妙，这样，你就完成了第一个UFO结构。<br>[Ali]; I saw on the bottom i wanted to look at the top it is like kind of like a tin glass and i can put my hand in through it and the plasma goes into my , into the palm of my hand<br>阿里：我在底端看到过，好想看看在上面是什么样 的。它就像锡杯，我可以把手伸进去，手掌都能感受到等离子运动。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Can you stop this video, Rick can you stop sharing the video<br>凯：瑞克，能不能把视频先暂停一下。<br>[Rick]: okay<br>瑞：好的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: You have achieved the construction of the first soft UFO what do you call it spaceship if come by uranium that is fantastic i am sure you understand the meaning of it<br>凯：你已经完成了第一个UFO或是你们所说的宇宙飞船的建造，如果加上铀，效果肯定更好，我相信你能懂我的意思。<br>[Ali]; Awesome i will go bring it over yeah hold on<br>阿里：好极了。等一下，我去拿过来。<br>[Mr Keshe]: I gave you the hint i gave you the structure and you,just do what you want to do,  Ali: Pardon?  Keshe:We keeps on falling off don’t worry, it got too excited Okay is that okay now ? You have to switch off you back light if you want to see it, and we are seeing you hair and your headphone<br>凯：我给你一些提示，交给你们结构是怎样的，接下来你们想怎么做就怎么做。阿里：怎么了？ 凯：没什么。我们这边有点掉线，不用担心。真的很激动。现在好了吗？如果你想看清楚，就要关掉壁灯。我们看到了你的头发和耳机。<br>[Ali]; Okay just hold on let me move this over a bit<br>阿里：好的。等一下，让我稍微挪动一下。<br>[Mr Keshe]: you have to get your stacker very straight, don’t move it<br>凯：你要把存储器竖直摆放，不要动。<br>[Ali]: Yes these are made of plastic plates so they are not that, just finished the stackers last night the making of the so<br>阿里：是的，这是塑料板，可能不会特别直，昨天晚上才做好的。<br>[Mr Keshe] You are feeding the bases together, exactly.<br>凯：你是给所有的底盘一起供能的。<br>[Ali]; So yeah the power comes from the bottom, i have 2 sets of different ganses so it starts from the heaviest gans goes to the middle and goes to ..<br>阿里：是的，底部要提供动力，在底盘我有两种甘斯的设置，于是能量从最重的甘斯到中间（手指从最低层移动到上面一层）。<br>[Mr Keshe]: You are following everything word by word<br>凯：你在一句句的教着。<br>[Ali]; yes , and then again heavier medium and CO2. and then at the top it feeds the stacker here all of them  at the bottom go to the top and connects to the second stacker goes to the top and then feeds the bottom, goes to the top. And i put like a really low voltage like maybe 2 Watts or 3 watts and an adapter when i go<br>阿里：呵呵。对。然后能量流到中间比较重的部分，再是CO2，上面给这个存储器提供动力，而底端的能量流到上面，与第二层相连，先到顶端，再向下，再去顶端。我用的电压比较低，大概是2到3瓦，还有一个适配器。<br>[Mr Keshe]; How do you feed the center column the one at the centre?<br>凯：你怎样给中间的圆柱供能的？<br>[Ali]; The centre column right now is plugged to my second magrave unit so i have another magrave unit here let me …<br>阿里：我刚刚在中间的圆柱中塞了一个磁引力装置，我还有一个。<br>[Mr Keshe]; are you married or are you single<br>凯：你结婚了还是单身？<br>[Ali]: im single<br>阿里:单身。<br>[Mr Keshe]; No wonder your time to make things<br>凯：难怪有时间做这些东西。<br>[Ali] so i have another crystal 6 stacker here .<br>阿里：我还有一个晶体，6个存储器。<br>[Mr Keshe]; I have seen this before. Ali: yeah, so this ten right now is plugged feeding the other right now. Keshe:you have achieved the first space ship structure and i congratulate you.<br>凯：嗯，我之前看到了。阿里：这十个被用来给另一个存储器供能。你现在已经完成了第一个宇宙飞船结构，恭喜你。<br>[Ali]; Thank you i am really happy.<br>阿里：谢谢。我也很开心。<br>[Mr Keshe]: you have to know how to strengthen the wall of it and you have to understand how to , this just what i was just teaching this morning You have to understand how to strengthen it,in a connecting one to the other, what i suggest you to do is stop making the carboxides, the zinc oxide. the what do you call these CO2 and CH3 make a slightly different, can you switch you light off? can you make the dark room is that okay<br>凯：（02.07.04）你要知道怎样加强场强，我今天早晨刚讲过的，你要知道在两个存储器相连时怎样增强它。我建议你不要再做碳氧化物或氧化锌，或者是你说的CO2、CH3，稍稍做些改变。你能把灯关掉，让房间变暗一些吗？<br>[Ali]; Yes sure<br>阿里：好的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Can you move you hand inside it ?<br>凯：你能把手伸进去吗？<br>[Ali]: That is bit too dark so i am going to open up another light here yeah so that’s the…<br>阿里：这样房间太暗了，我想打开这边的小灯。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Can you tell where you see the shimmer or is it,do you see it now or ?<br> 凯：你能告诉我们微光在哪里，现在你能看到吗？<br>[Ali]; Yeah it’s really like little particles of light now that coming around here. when i go underneath i can see something above here i can’t even touch it, is like a little glass thing that keeps moving sometimes it shapes around like even there is a rotational field that i see ，especially in the centre, i see a big column coming out, like white column coming out of here in middle.<br>阿里：能。大概在这里有小颗粒一样的微光。如果我从下面看，大概在距离存储器顶端15到20厘米的半空中有光，我不能碰，像玻璃一样，不断地移动，我看到这边就有旋转的磁场，特别是中间出来的状似白色圆柱的光。<br>[Mr Keshe]: you have achieved the production of the first space ship system And I congratulate you<br>凯：你已经做出了第一个宇宙飞船系统，恭喜你。<br>[Ali] thank you, Thank you Mr Keshe<br>阿里：谢谢你。<br>[Mr Keshe] :You have to know how to strengthen the centre field as well that it can spread between the 3 dishes. We will show this technology worldwide, it in the coming time and this was part of the force field for bring world peace. What you have to do if you can, is to fix this structure solid, fix it to a plate that none of your plates move and none of your plates move sideways. Fix it into the structure that can be held with the power systems which you had brought and exactly what I showed in a couple of Thursdays ago and you followed it, the intentions was to get you to show someone and show somebody and you have done it.<br>凯：你要知道怎样增强中间的磁场从而向四周其他三个单元之间扩散。我们向公众展示这项技术，它将为世界带来和平。你还能做的就是使这个系统更坚固，固定它们，使之不会向侧边移动，把它放入你做的动力系统中，这是我几个星期前的周四讲的，你就这样做。这样一来，你就能向别人展示你已做成这个系统。<br>[Ali]: Thank you and I was also thinking maybe you use different kind of cores because now everything is copper, we want to have gradients of differences so maybe a …<br>阿里：谢谢您。我在想要不要试试别的材质的核心，我们现在用的是铜，如果我们想感受不同梯度不同层次的力量，那么。<br>[Mr Keshe] :  A lot of field forces you don’t see. remove you plates and it fuses the fields force. you understand when you central column and the slight move and you don’t see it to differentiate tomorrow morning the move themselves. You have achieved the first UFO structure I congratulate you<br>凯：你还有很多磁力没有感受到。移走塑料盘会将磁场融合在一起。如果你稍微移动中间圆柱，没有什么变化，第二天你就可以移动它们。（指的是通过有形的单元已经形成了一个固定的无形的UFO磁场）还要恭喜你已经完成第一个UFO结构。<br>[Ali] : Thank you  阿里：谢谢。<br>[Mr Keshe]: it is a very joyful time, and those of you be promised by 2016 we will do it and we<br>are getting what you promised now you done it because I told you, inspire those I don’t teach but I show and if you, what you got to see when you put your hand in or out, how do you feel emotionally?<br>凯：真的很开心。2016年的许诺我们还会继续完成，就像现在我们已经实现之前的心愿一样。还会不断指导大家，激励我没有教的人，我会向你们展示。你再看看，把手伸进去再拿出来，会有什么感觉？<br>[Ali]; Definitely,  I definitely felt it the first time I was there, It was like I was buzzing inside this thing and it wasn’t even connected to anything, like I was putting the plates one by one the minute I was standing on top of it, my whole body was buzzing and it just feels good to be inside it<br>阿里：好的。我感觉像是第一次到这里，,没有连接到其他物体，我好像在这个里面有些晕晕的一样，就像是 我站在上面把塑料盘一个个堆起来，我整个身体都发出嗡嗡的声音，在里面感觉很好。<br>[Mr Keshe]: See you power supply which is electron vibration which is not as strong enough, you have to change you power supply you can keep your power supply the way you want. Caroline, escheat of what do you call this spaceship. And in parallel with it, plasmatic batteries used to control it in a way that with one of you bases, put let us see 4 batteries the next one do 5 batteries and with the 3rd one to 6 batteries. All in series and the way you have done, but your batteries have to be parallel with each other you understand.<br>凯：你的动力系统是电流，所以感觉不是很强烈，你要更换电源，换成你想用的，凯若琳或是你们所说的宇宙飞船，同时，等离子电池用来控制系统的底层，放四块电池，旁边的放5块，第三个圆柱底端放六块。所有的都连在一起，但是电池要平行放置。<br>[Ali]: yes 阿里：好的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: And then what you got to do? On every line which you now come around the 3 bases connect one line from your magnetically side or from your gravitational side to the centre column. You understand? now you have connected the 3 bases in a series to each other and you have connected the central column to another power supply. You need to connect a gravitational and a magnetic or as a feed back to the 3 bases to the line that you are feeding with another supply power, you need this to be able to control and one thing that you gonna be make sure is the your systems are locked, make sure that you systems are locked that is what I said, I am carrying with me 5 units for this purpose. We are showing to the world leaders that time of changes has come and you showed it<br>凯：接下来你要做什么呢？每条线上都连接3个基座，再用一条线从磁力圈或引力圈一端与中间圆柱相连，你能明白吗？（02.13.15）这样周围的3个基座相互之间连成系列，中间的圆柱连另一个电源。用磁力或引力圈与之相连，或是作为三个基座连在一条线上的反馈，就要有另一个电源提供动力。你要能够控制这个系统，还有一点就是这个系统必须是固定的，如我之前所说，要用5个装置来实现这一目标。我们将向各国领导人展示的时代改变已经来临。<br>[Ali]: And having said that having the coils the new format of 3 dimensional format that I would say if had all 3 coils in that format that would even be better. Isn’t it.<br> 阿里：如果将线圈换成新的三维版式的线圈，情况也许会更好。不是吗？（试图将线圈相互垂直）<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yes, you are going too far but it’s good, the way you have to do. it is you have to make sure that your gravitational distance between you gravitational centre ring is equal to the distance to the centre. You coils can touch each other, you gravitational coils can touch each other or its advisable to, you know when you do this one and you then you do the next one, try to keep a gap equal between your gravitational coils too, but they do not touch, if your coil is 5 cm I think you are using a 82 turn it should be 5.2 cm or something like this<br>凯：是的。你跳跃的太快了，但是对的。那么，你要保证引力圈环间的引力距离要和 到中心的距离相同。线圈可以相互接触，引力线圈可以相互碰触或最好是这样，你要知道什么时候该怎样做，保持相同的引力线圈间的间隙，这个不能碰触，如果你的线圈是5cm,就用82转，这样就是5.2cm.<br> [Ali]: Im using 89 and 144 so it’s the golden ratio 1.61  (02.15.17)<br> 阿里：我用的是89和144，黄金比例1.61.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: so your stackers have to open up slightly but they will be placed on tight, make sure you have a feed back and start feeding, because when you start feeding all of the batteries on each base in the system 4,5 and 6 you create that variation in power that creates the rotation of the plasma and by feeding from you magnetical to your gravitational from gravitational to central stacker you create a balance lift. if you fit it to the table correctly and if you get you spaces correctly, your table first of all you should see a shimmer and then you should not be able to see you system anymore except like, You are very close to a compete flying system but try you are on the right path, Its just  you gotta understand,if any of these plates move and you lose your strength and that what happens most of the time<br> 凯：那么存储器就要稍微打开一点，但是整体的结构必须是紧凑的，确保你能得到反馈，然后再开始提供动力，因为当你为所有电池提供动力，无论是4个、5个还是6个，在能量上会有差别，从而形成等离子的旋转运动。从磁力圈到引力圈，再从引力圈到中心存储器的能量供给，你就实现了平衡有序的飞升。如果系统能很好地适应桌面或是空间，就会先是在桌子上能看到微光，之后你可能就不会看到你的系统了（指的是这个人飞升了）。你马上就能完成整个飞行系统，但是一定要采用正确的方法，现在你要理解，如果你的塑料盘移动了，就会失去动力，大部分情况都是这样的。<br>[Ali]: Okay, one of the things I like is to connect to my consciousness and use and move the unit with my mind and the reason I use quartz crystals in the gans was that the quartz is the bridge between you consciousness and the physical aspects<br>阿里：好的。我想说，这个系统好像与我的意识连接在一起，我可以用意念来使用或移动这个装置。我用和甘斯混合的石英晶体的原因就是它像是一座桥梁把我的身体和意识相连接。<br>[Mr. Keshe ]: you don’t need to do it, you achieved the first step in the structure in what need to be done correct and do it the right way and one of the things you will find out you got to do. I see you have got wires touching everywhere make sure your wires don’t touch the floor. Do all this changes and you will see a color, you see what it was doing and what is not doing, you electric current wires should not be inline they all  have to come from underneath because you can put it away.<br>凯：你不用这样做。你已经成功迈出了第一步，成功把这个结构建成，做了你该做的事情。我刚才注意到你的电线摆放的哪里都有，注意不要让它接触到地板。完成我刚刚说的这些操作后，你会看见一种颜色，就知道有什么做了以及什么没有做。你的电线不应是这样内联在一起，因为它们不得不从下面上来，你可以把电线拿走了。<br>Make sure the whole environment is in a constant balance of the electron field but not in a plasmatic field and if you have seen the shimmer, this is what I have told you will see a shimmer suddenly become solid, possibly you will not see you plates. It is possible. it make you come invisible but if you see the thing, if you have, if you want to see and want to become invisible or becomes a point that you don’t see it. Before you even start any further build yourself 4 capacitors in  parallel and 8 capacitors in series, it is very important, you make 4 capacitors in parallel and 8 in series, connect them in series to each other and if you do not see the visible system if you get to that point to which, I hope you don’t because you have a misrelated, you just put the 2 end of the wire, everything has to be nano coated in the zone where last you have seen your system. It will bring you the universal power supply and  the current flow of the plasma it becomes visible that is the only way you can make things visible or make yourself 4 capacitors block in parallelthe way you can and then 8 in series, then you will create a power flow but the create a capacitor with a capacitance which is the same at what you have and your system becomes invisible or visible. You can add to the power supply, you don’t if you build it just get a a long string of wire, you can poke into the shimmer you see.<br> 确保整个环境都是稳定的电场而不是等离子场。如果你看到微光，这就是我之前说的，微光突然稳定，可能你不会看到塑料盘，这是很可能出现的。你可能会看不到事物，如果你能看见或是想看到，如果你看不到，或者达到某个点让你看不见，这样在你想再往前走一步之前，放置4个平行的电容器以及8个连接成一系列的电容器，这个步骤很重要，四个平行的电容器和8个连在一起的电容器，如果你没有看到系统，假如出现这种情况的话，当然我希望不会出现这样的的情况，那是因为你有一个错误的连接，（正确的）就是要把电线两端连接到装置中，这个区域所有的装置都要纳米涂层的，最后你就会看到整个系统。这种就是宇宙能量供给，等离子流也是可见的。系统可见的方法就是放置四个平行的电容器，然后是8个连在一起的电容器，这样就产生了动力流，但是创建一个电容器或制造电容，会使整个系统可见或不可见。你随时可以增加能量供应，就是把一条电线插进你看到的微光中。<br>[Ali]; Thank you Mr. Keshe, thank you everyone thank you Rick<br>阿里：非常感谢您，谢谢所有人，还有瑞克。<br>[Mr Keshe]: this is fantastic, This is what we said we are going to see a shimmer that is what you saw, this is what the purpose I taught .so somebody will do it and you have done it, and it is nice to see that it has been achieved in such a way. You have to move back, but if you have a, I know you have one of the videos because I think one of you has already done a video. Do you have one of these pens which show the field? Which lights on the top.<br>凯：很好。根据我们所能能看到微光，然后你就看到了。这就是我上课的目的。总有人会这样做，而你确实做到了。非常荣幸能看到你做到了这一点。你可以再回顾一下，你应该有之前的视频，就是你有能散发磁场的笔吗，就是上面亮着的那个。<br>[Ali]: Are you talking about these pens?<br>阿里：您是说这样的笔吗？<br>[Mr Keshe]: which lights on the top,<br>凯：就是上面亮着的。<br>[Ali]; Because is was not my video im not sure<br>阿里：因为不是我的视频，我不太确定。<br>[Mr Keshe]: oh yeah Alex, has one of these, and get one of those and see how your field goes we gonna disclose this, I think we have to do it. Is Alex on the background anywhere? Stay there Ali please<br>凯：哦，是阿历克斯。他有一支，去找一支这样的笔，然后看看你的系统的磁场会是什么情况。我们准备关闭视频了。阿历克斯在吗？阿里，你先等一下。<br>[Rick] So Alex you wanna go ahead<br>瑞：阿历克斯，你能接通吗？<br>[Alex]: Hello<br>阿：你好。<br>[All]: Hi Alex how are you?<br>阿历克斯，你好啊。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Alex, there is a reason I have brought you in here is what you are doing at home with the lights flashing if you create such a position and put the end of a light near the washing machine and think to different part of the plasma he makes, you will see the same light<br>凯：现在找你是有个问题要问，你房间里的灯在闪，你在做什么啊？如果现在是这样一种情况，就是把灯的一端放在洗碗机旁，他制作的等离子体会有什么不同吗，还是会看到同样的灯光？<br>[Alex] Okay<br>阿：好的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: You understand<br>凯：你听懂了吗？<br>[Alex] I am gonna do that<br>阿：我准备试试。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Do you want to share with us what you have done?<br>凯：可以跟我们说说你在干什么了吗？<br>[Alex]: I have , It is not configure now because I have been in the kitchen yesterday,<br>现在还没有成形，因为我昨天一直待在厨房。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Would you like to explain what you showed me a couple of days ago<br>凯：你可以向我们解释一下几天前你给我看的东西吗？<br>[Alex]; Alright when you plug your appliances to the magrave system even when the system is switched off it has a lot of current in it, like if you put a .<br>阿：好的，当你把装置放在磁引力系统中，即使系统是关闭的，你也会看到电流。<br>[Mr Keshe]: It is a plasma current not an electric current<br>凯：这是等离子流不是电流。<br>[Alex]: Oh yeah, if you connect one wire to the appliance for instance like a washing machine and then at the other end of the wire you get a lot of current.<br>阿：是的。比如，你用一条线与这个装置比如洗碗机连接起来，在另外一端你就能感受到大量的电流。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Let us say to the wall of the machine not to the machine itself just connect it anywhere on the body of the machine<br>凯：应该是连接到机器的边缘而不是机器，你可以把电线连在机器上的任何地方。<br>[Alex]: And then you connect the other one to the end you get, passing light, passing currenti have trying to find out how to, I have been trying to make this discovery but it really not possible.<br>Mr Keshe told me to add some capacitors which I did but nothing changed.<br>阿：然后把另外一条线连在它的底部，然后灯就会亮，有电流通过，我想弄清楚这是怎么一回事，不停地尝试，都没有发现。凯史先生告诉我添加几个电容器，我也试了，但还是没有什么变化。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yeah but you have to add enough to reach the point<br>凯史：你必须要增加足够大的电流直到那个平衡值。<br>[Alex]: I have to add a lot of capacitors?<br>阿：可以加很多电容器吗？<br>[Mr Keshe]:  since there is AC to DC flow<br>凯：就是AC档变为DC档。<br>[Alex]: But sometimes it’s works with DC as well, it depends on what part of the machine<br>阿：但是，有的时候已经到了DC了，应该还是要看连接在机器的哪个部分。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yeah this are the fairly a bit large LED bulbs 3 of them. Can you tell us what is the power of them<br>凯史：是的。这里有3个相当大的LED灯泡，你能告诉我们电力大概是多少吗？<br>[Alex]: If fluctuates, I think it is between 120V- …<br>阿;这也是上下浮动的。我想应该是120伏到<br>[Mr Keshe]: No no the power, how much does it say like how much energy?<br>凯：不是的。我指的是它有多大能量？<br>[Alex] Yes that is what  I am saying on the reading it is 120V then it goes down to about 80 or 86V.<br>阿：是的，这就是我说的120伏，低一点可能是80或86伏<br>[Mr Keshe]: I mean on the bulb on the light bulb you use what does it say is the power of them<br>凯：我指的是灯泡上的，它的能量。<br>[Alex] Oh it is 12. 12V DC LED lights and then in it. I will make a video and put it online so that anyone can see.<br>阿：是12,12伏 DC LED灯。我会把它做成视频放在网上，以便大家观看。<br>[Mr Keshe]: How many are you using 3 of them?<br>凯：你是怎么用这三个的？<br>[Alex]: Sometime is use 4 but if I use 4 one of them just blows up or just comes on lightly<br>阿：有时是用四个。但有时它会爆炸有时仅是微弱的光。<br>[Mr Keshe]: This is to show that for the first time, maybe you understand why I said to you use a capacitor in 4 and 8 that we don’t need to connect to the system, to the margrave system to use this energy, because it is plasmatic it flows ,so in a way, what you add to the body of the freezer and to the earth, that is why you have faulty AC because you connect it the sink to the same. But if you connect it to another part of another system. This is kilowatt and Kilowatt you can use which is a plasmatic and you have free energy.<br>凯：这就是，你要理解我为什么说要用4个和8个电容器，并不需要把它们放到磁引力系统中，因为这是等离子体的，它会流动。你把它与冷冻器或是土地相连，这就是为什么会出现错误的AC，因为你把它与同一种东西相连。但是如果你把它连到另一个系统中，那就是千瓦，等离子体就会产生千瓦的能量，然后你也就有自由动力。<br>[Alex]: Yeah that is true because even the …<br>阿：对，是这样的。因为即使<br>[Mr Keshe]:  Let me explain , Alex please. Those of you who have been looking for power supply free energy from the margrave unit after the margrave this is where it comes all before the margrave when you power it. You do not connect to the power unit ,you connect to a power unit which is already supplying appliance or another unit，<br>凯：请听我解释，阿历克斯。那些像你一样从磁引力场寻找自由动力的人，在此之前，当你准备为系统提供动力时，不要将把它与能量装置连接到一起，将其与正在为其他装置提供能量的装置相连。<br>And then you connect that unit and you connect total plasma condition and whatever you use in the plasma condition because it doesn’t go through your meter is a free flow energy. This is in the part of the adding of the knowledge will come next step in the 60 days for those who have started putting 400 , 500 Watts , after the system and too before the systems, now you have to run this for about 60 days maybe 3 months and then if you connect it into the appliance which you put after the system and you connect to a line before the system or earth it you get an AC supply or a DC high voltage for your system to use and anything you use in this side is free.<br>连接后，就与整个等离子体环境相连，无论你在等离子环境中使用什么，因为它不经过电表，它是自由流动的能量。这是接下来两个月要讲的课程，主要针对那些刚开始用400/500瓦的人群。在开始讲述这个系统前，你必须已将其运行两、三个月。如果你在建立系统后将它与装置连接起来，或在系统建立前连上一条线或者把接地线，那么你获得的AC或DC高压为系统提供动力即是免费自由的。<br>It is too early for us to release it because none of you have gone through that process. The reason Alex is getting this is because he has already been using this for nearly 6 months in the house. Everything in the house is plasma flow and very soon you should be pointed out that you don’t need to have any more wire into the system. I have told Alex what to do hopefully he gets a chance to do it and tell us next week or 2 how to make the wireless systems in the power supply. Your margrave system come to use for power supply and let Alex do his work, he knows what he wants to do. Have you managed to do it yet Alex?<br>对我们来说这些有些早了，因为你们都还没有到这个过程。阿历克斯能做是因为他6个月前就在这个房间里使用此系统。房间里的所有东西都是等离子流，很快你就会发现这个系统不需要任何电线。我已经告诉阿历克斯该怎么做，相信会在接下来的一或两周时间向大家展示如何为一个无线系统提供动力，也就是用磁引力系统提供动力。你的磁引力场系统就是用来提供能量供应的。好了，让阿历克斯做自己的事情吧。他知道该怎么做，接下来你准备怎么办，阿历克斯？<br>[Alex]: I would have for the equipment I am still waiting for it to come. When it comes i am going to do that.<br>阿：我还在等一些设备，到了之后我就开始做了。<br>[Mr Keshe]: How are you going to receive that soon weren’t you going to show me yesterday.<br>凯：怎么会这么快，昨天你不刚给我说吗？<br>[Alex]; Maybe 阿：希望快些。<br>[Mr Keshe]: No problem thanks anyway, it is a pleasure to work with you Alex<br>凯：没关系。不管怎样都要谢谢你。与你一起工作很开心。<br>[Alex]; Alright Mr. Keshe, thank you 阿：谢谢凯史先生。<br>[Mr Keshe]: This is where now we come we’re going to do total work through plasma. as I said to you we gradually go because we allow people and knowledge seekers to add to the knowledge as it builds up the system which you see here on the screen on the table with Ali is the first system A lot  of you will try this process and you will fail because you are not following the rules  of what i said you dont follow the process the way I have said.. Some of you will succeed but halfway collectively we all will achieve it, this is a victory or success for humanity that is not one of us but all of us reaches.<br>凯：这就是整个等离子系统中开始的地方。像我说的那样，我们逐步向前，希望有更多探索知识的人和我们一起努力，来构建这个系统，也就是屏幕的桌子上放置的系统，阿里目前是第一人。很多人都会经历这个过程，也会有失败的案例，因为没有按照我说地去做。还有一些人会成功，但这是我们共同实现的，这是人性的胜利，不仅仅是个人，而是所有人实现的。<br>At the foundation we have access to people like Ali and the others who are around have all the gone to the phase of producing these things. One of the ways in a future i will show you the 3 dimensional without the 2 coils. We have already produced  in the ration of section August October of this year and we will show it. It sits in Phillipine we bring it to be show now that it’s been put to an advance. It is combination of both magnetic and gravitational field with one  structure and its been made by our people in the Philippines they did not bring it to the table, now it is time to bring it to the table they bring it out and showing,<br>在基金会中，我们有机会可以接触到像阿里这样的人，其他人应该也已经开始制作这些东西了。未来可能会是三维系统，而不是两个线圈。今年八月和十月，我们在菲律宾已经实现了量产，取得一些创新成果，由于比较重要而且很先进，我们很快就会推出。系统实现了磁力场和引力场的融合，共同融合在同一个结构中，是我们在菲律宾的工作人员设计的，他们不是把系统放置在桌子上，但是是时候让他们拿出来展示给大家了。<br>What we got to do Ali is make sure the fields within the system feed themselves.Don’t allow any leakage connect the magnetic and gravitational fields on both stackers, if i was you i connect the gravitational of all the 3 trays at the bottom to the gravitational of the bottom bottom plate and connect the magnetical part to the top of the plate we see on the top. Have you connected the 2 stackers on top to each other or is it just free?<br>阿里，我们需要做的是让系统为自己提供动力，维持其正常运行。不要让两个存储器相连的磁力场和引力场发生泄漏。如果我是你，我会把所有圆柱三层塑料盘的底部引力场与最下面塑料盘的引力场连接起来，然后将其磁力场与上面的塑料盘相连。你有没有把上面的两个盘子连起来还是什么都没有做？<br>[Ali]: No the 2 stackers are connected. so the bottom goes to the second ，3rd one to the up to the up so all of them are connected in series - to +<br>不，是连在一起的。所以，最下面向上连，到第二层，到第三层，这样一层一层地向上连在一起。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think i would have been advisable to keep the 3 stackers separately<br>凯：我想最好还是让三层相互隔离分开。<br>[Ali]: Or just do 3 by 3  (02.30.05)<br>阿里：或者直接三个三个的连。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Now that you have connected the  magnetical from the 3 plates and  gravitational from the 3 plates to the bottom and magnetical to the top, you create the the flow you are looking for , you should see the top of your system creates a whitey silverish glow.and then you should see what you would see is that this white silverish glow will move away. it is like a bubble. You should see a bubble which comes up about the same distance as the one of the stackers and then he will create in one sweep a flash of light. It just comes like a flash of light will connect with the 3 base bottoms and you will see your UFO or your spaceship.<br>凯：既然你已经把三个塑料盘的磁力场和引力场相连，引力场与底部相连，磁力场与顶端相连，那么你就会发现要找的磁场等离子流。整个系统的上方会出现银白色的气流，然后你会看到这个银白色气流会移动，它就像一个气泡，你会看到一个气泡上升的距离就像是一个栈式存储器的高度，然后会扫出一道光，就像一道闪电，与三个基底相连，这样你就会看到UFO或是宇宙飞船。<br>You have to see the floating bubble up, if your system is made in a way that i showed in the pictures 14 bubbles sit in the middle between what do you call it, the 5th  and 6th as you can see. Then you will have a problem. If you do your stacker solid, i wish i could send you, send the …, I tell what we are going to do Ali, you get some…, my… , hold on…,Is Ella on the line ?We have Ella anywhere today? Vince do you see her in the background , or Stanley<br>你要看到这个漂浮的气泡不断上升，如果你的系统像我在图上讲解的那样在第5层和第6层之间有14个气泡，那就有问题了。如果你把这些存储器固定下来，我想我应该可以送给你一些，阿里，我要说，阿里，你会获得一些…艾拉在网路上吗？她在哪儿啊？文思，你在后面看见她斯坦利？<br>[Vince] No i don’t see them<br>文：我没有见到他们。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What i am going to do Ali is  i am going to the factory to send you 10 boxes, the blue boxes that you can build you stacker solid into the boxes<br>凯史：阿里，我会让工厂送你10个盒子，就是那个蓝盒子，你可以把存储器在盒子里固定。<br>[Ali]: Thank you very much Mr. Keshe i highly appreciate it .<br>阿：非常感谢您，凯史先生。真的很感谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: go to Ella and give your address to Ella and we send you the boxes through<br>凯：你把你的地址给艾拉，然后我们会把它寄给你。<br>[Rick]: Just send to me in the web master<br>瑞：在网站主页上把地址给我就可以了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:Sorry vince is Francois or JF online? Nothing maybe JF is not listening. I think Francois or JF have about 20 boxes they can give you in Canada a few pieces<br>凯：抱歉。文思，弗朗赛或者杰夫在线吗？没什么事，杰夫可能没在。我记得他们有20个箱子，这样就可以直接在加拿大给你一些。<br>[Rick]: Let me work on the back<br>瑞：我去后面看一下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes work on the background because 20 boxes went to JF for other thing he is doing. Ask them to give you the boxes and put these rings in the boxes. Then they are solid, they don’t move<br>凯：好的，去看一下。因为杰夫用这20个箱子做其他项目了。让他们给你一些，然后把圆盘放进去，这样就固定了。<br>[Ali] Thank you very much<br>阿：谢谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You are quite welcome and congratulation i salute you<br>凯：不用客气。我要恭喜你。<br>[Ali] Thank you peace to this planet and to the whole universe<br>阿：谢谢。愿世界和平，宇宙和平。<br>[Rick] We still have the night  before christmas you still got a lot<br>瑞：今天还有平安夜，你会得到礼物的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Not forget the light of christmas came from the Iranian culture<br>凯：不要忘记伊朗文化中的圣诞节灯光。<br>[Rick] On the day before christ’s birthday. Kind of a spoiler it’s interesting<br>瑞：圣诞节的礼物正在路上。真是天上掉馅饼。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:We should be able to do it. I think there are the units with JF we can transfer if you are in Canada, you literally rapidly get it to each other and some more to jam, We are going to announce as part of the structure as part of the process with respect to our work in the coming days ,which is what now what do you call it Ali has shown we will make an announcement in this respect as part of the world peace project. We are very much on course we do not disclose the way we used to for people to cause trouble but we are on our way and this completes information depended by , Ali project needs a lot of very very fine tuning to get it and you will see it. Your cups, your plates the way they are stacked, they destroy a lot of you field that is why a lot of your, the shimmer you see is not so strong. You have to get it perfectly right<br>凯：我们应该这样做。如果你在加拿大，杰夫就能把这些东西直接送给你了。你很快就能拿到，还有一些要给杰姆。作为这个结构或整个项目的一部分，我们会在接下几天发个通知。就像阿里展示的，我们会就世界和平项目发一份声明。我们还在路上，不会去揭露那些为人们带来麻烦的方法，而是去整合我们需要的信息。阿里，这个工程项目需要很多调试音，你会看到的。你的杯子、盘子的堆放方式会破坏你的磁场，这就是为什么很多人看到的只是点点微光，你必须合理安排。<br>[Rick]: Are they styrofoam plates<br>瑞：那是餐盘吗？<br>[Ali]: yeah the one which you use to save on food<br>阿里：是的，是我以前用来放食物的盘子。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: you have to stack them very perfectly correctly  and you have to make sure your centre fields are all the same. when you used, because now the units you had, you need the 2nd generation of the plates, the present generation is a very thick wall between the coils you have to turn it upside down or cut the centre half and put the thing on it. i have done that in factory a couple of weeks ago.<br>凯史：你必须把它们合理堆放，同时要确保中心磁场必须是一致的。你需要重新换一套盘子，因为现在的线圈之间的盘子太厚，你要把它翻过来，或是把中间切掉，然后把东西放上去。我之前在工厂里这样做过。<br>When you get it if you a problem to do it ,contact me and i tell you how to do it. You have to clip the middle plate out and you have the ring to put it in the position and all you need to is to string it and  it hold in exactly the same position. the plates of the new core coming out in january. But we get on the line all the systems which we have sold or has been ordered or had been manufactured and have left  or leaving in the next few days. Speaking of the New Year and Christmas, the factory must have been shut down to make sure we have no orders.  all the power units just waiting to be shipped. Literally or technically no problems inside.Labeling that boxes have been packaged wish it  is completed by the end of the year Hopefully we  able to do.<br>当你收到盒子后，如果有任何问题，就联系我。我会告诉你该怎么做。你要把盘子中间剪开，将剩下的圆环放在相应位置，再串起来，这样就能保持在原来的位置上。新的内核会在一月份生产出来。我们网上的那些系统都已经卖掉或者被预订，或者正在生产中，在接下来的几天会送走。说到圣诞节和新年，工厂要暂时停业，在此之前要完成订单所有的动力装置准备装船，箱内物品也有标识，所有的盒子也已打包。希望年底前都能做好，希望我们能够做到。</p>
<p>All the power units or car units should be  0 ordered backlog in the centre end  of December and all the unit which is going charity organisation should be coming out of the Philippine government and to the African nations should be completed by hopefully end of January.so with this number equal to sales sent to the Palestinian government to the African nations and to the Italian population in a very random manner .on the other hand i should say today is the day before christmas and maybe we have received our presents for the christmas with seeing what is in front of us. So 2016 will be the change and we have seen the change before 2016 and the wisdom comes from within not from outside and it’s beautiful that is found within the structure of Keshe foundation where we will work and i shall openly show it. If you can place this unit on a transparent plastic that if you manage to get it lifted from this position you will see the star formation  light on there very very easily and the plastic will allow you to see it. I congratulate in a very deep way.<br>所有的动力装置或车用单元都已在12月中完成订单，送给慈善机构的单元也已经准备好；还有送往非洲各国的应该会在一月末完成，与销售额相同数量的装备会非常随机的送给巴勒斯坦政府，非洲国家以及意大利。另一方面，今天是圣诞节前一天，也许我们收到的圣诞礼物就在眼前。2016年会是变化的一年，之前也已经发生很多改变，智慧也会由内而外散发，这样很美妙，就像我们看到的凯史基金会的结构一样，我们再一起工作，在一起分享。（对阿里说）如果你把这个单元放在透明塑料上，如果你试图让它在这个位置上飞升，你会发现这个星型组合变得很轻并很容易就被抬起，塑料能够帮助你。预祝你能有更进一步的发现。[Ali] Same here i send my love to you, and to everyone and this earth and everyone in the universe<br> 阿里：我也是。希望你和所有人都能安好。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Just carry on like this you have a perfect job .you have to just balance it. If you photograph this shot ,you will see your plates change position because they are loose, you need to lock it in . Get polytrim pins and go and lock and tie them up, like put 4 pins around, drill it through that it just hold them in their position.You know this plastic pipes that they hold them to the safe regular stacker  and i’m sure if you get it right, if you haven’t interfered with anything you should be able to do to show the whole shimmer. There is a problem with this, i know i can see it to reach a full, what i call the spaceship shape but make sure all the time you keep this system off the ground.<br>凯：像现在这样继续，你一定会取得好成果的。你需要的就是保持平衡，如果你能把现在的情况拍下来，就会发现盘子很容易就会移位，因为他们摆放的很松，因而必须要固定。找别针把它们固定住，然后固定，在连接在一起，可以用四枚针钻个孔别在四周，这样就能固定，你知道的，这个塑料盘子能使里面的弹簧系统成为安全正常的能量单元。我相信你能做好，如果你还没有用其他东西，那你就可以试一试，就能看到整个微光。这可能也存在一些问题，我相信总会实现的，成为宇宙飞船的形状。但也要注意一定要远离地面。<br>[Ali]: Okay  好的。</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: Keep this system off the ground . If you keep it into ground level, ,you will not see such an effect.When you put it on a transparent plate make sure the plate doesn’t sit flat like this on the table,  they has 2,3 legs to make them minimize any connection. But it will do, keep a distance measurement and try to leave a radio very near to this and listen to the radio ,constantly listen to the radio, it tells you if  you hear the break in the noise, the sound goes down the radio goes silence, it means just go out of the room in a safe distance because the field start building up and it builds very rapidly and the system you will see the structure of the spaceship. but i have done this many time and leave a radio very close by. people who work with us know what i am talking about, when the noise of the radio goes when you feel expansion comes but with this system you have a rapid expansion and you will go very very fast and fly<br>凯：一定要让他远离地面。如果接触到地面的话，你就不会看到这种效果。你不会想看见这样的情况的。如果你把它放在透明盘子上，确保这盘子不是像在这个桌子上是水平的，它们要有两三个支撑点，从而把所有的连接最小化。还有，要确保距离一致，并在系统周围放一个收音机，用来听广播，要一直放，一直听，它会告诉你一些事情：如果你听到噪音中的破裂声，声音越来越小直至没有的时候，就是提醒你要赶快离开房间到安全距离以外，因为这个时候系统的磁场开始运行，而且运行速度特别快，之后就会看到宇宙飞船的结构。我之前试验过很多次，把收音机放得很近，和我一起工作的人知道我在说什么，当收音机的噪音出现，当你能感受到周围力量在蔓延，扩张速度非常快，那么这个时候，你会感到越来越快并飞起来。<br>[Ali]: OKay 好的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Just get yourself a radio, you need to listen to FM and AM ,you need 2 of them, one gives you the indication which way you are going<br>凯：记得准备一个收音机，你要听FM和AM，两个都要听，在听某一个频率的时候，你就知道什么时候要离开了。<br>[Ali]; Okay, Thank you Mr Keshe<br>阿里：好的，谢谢凯史先生。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You have done exactly what was said and this is absolutely perfect .so just don’t forget to add the Capacitors ,so listen to this presentation 3 or 4 times before you start working, get everything correct, if we just found Francois online, we could have got you. Give your address to, what do you call it, webmaster and we will get you somehow these units to be done .but our units for this things require a little bit of modification, but it locks in your systems, it locks the system in it doesn’t just l et it move it goes into the box to margrave unit . Arman are you online, I know you are online<br> 凯：你已经做了要做的东西，非常好。不要忘记使用电容器，在你开始之前把这次的课程多听3、4遍，每件事情都做好。如果刚才弗朗赛在线，就能把这些东西给你。把你的地址给网站管理员，我们会送给你一些做好的单元。不过，我们的这些装置可能还需要稍微改装一下，但它肯定能固定你的系统，不会让它移动，然后会形成磁引力场。阿曼，你在线吗？我知道你在。<br>[ARMAN]; Yes 是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: have you transferred the unite which was supposed to go the department of energy or it is still with you<br> 凯：你把之前的装置送给能源机构了吗？还是你还在拿着？<br>[Arman]; NO 还没有<br> [Mr. Keshe]: I mean do you have it with you 4 or 5<br> 你有四个还是5个？<br>[Arman]: No I have 2<br> 我只有两个<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah you had 3 and you took 2 before , 5<br> 那你之前有三个，现在两个，就是五个。<br>[Arman]: No 2 I had and one is the in the factory<br> 不，我只剩下两个了，有一个还在工厂。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No problem, it is just that I wanted to see how fast we can get him some units to lock it in. It okay see what you can if you have a problem, the guys in Canada I know there is 20 units on the way that was see that they get you that<br>没关系，我就想了解一下我们多快能把这些装置给阿里固定系统。好了，没关系，只要你有问题，我们就能帮助你。在加拿大的同事有20个箱子，很快就会送给你的。<br>[Ali]: Okay that would be excellent, thanks you  好的，真是太感谢了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Congradulations fantastic and on before Christmas. Any other thing we can see?<br>凯：再次祝贺。还有其他问题吗？<br>[Rick]: Yes, sorry who is here ?<br> 瑞：好的，请问贵姓？<br>[Bernard]: (02.44.28) Its Bernard, I might have a system to show here, I have been holding off on it I didn’t want to confuse everything it pertaining to the same principles as Mr Keshe has brought up if we have got time maybe I can show it<br> 伯纳德：我是伯纳德。我建立了一个系统，为了不影响它的性能，我与它保持了一定距离，而且我是按照凯史先生讲的原理做的，如果您有时间，我可以向您展示一下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes please why not<br> 凯：好的。<br>[Bernard]: Hi Mr Keshe how are you, hello to everyone<br> 伯：开始先生，你好，大家好。<br>[Rick]; Show your video then we can put it no<br> 瑞：把你的视频给我们看一下，我可以把它放上来。<br>[Bernard] I have a few photos and stuff, I have got a new mac here and im sort of getting hand on things cause im still tryna work, you might have to help me, I think I can show my screen<br> 伯：我只有一些照片。我刚换了一台电脑，我现在刚上手，可能需要您帮我一下，不过我可以给您看下我的屏幕。<br>[Rick]: You might not want to show your whole screen you might want to show just a window depending on what is on your screen because it will show everything on your screen<br> 瑞：你不用把整个屏幕都给我看看，给我看一个窗口就可以，这取决于你的屏幕上有什么东西，不然我会把屏幕所有的内容都看到。<br>[Bernard]: It is just a picture window that will show up and I will scroll through and click on what I want to show. Alright, I have a couple of short videos and I have a few pictures to show and I can explain it as we go I guess<br> 伯：只有一个图片窗口，我会拉动滚动条，然后点击我要展示的，对了，我有一些小视频和一些图片。在播放的时候，我会向你们解释。<br>[Rick]; Sure just click on share screen<br> 瑞：好的。点击分享视频就可以。<br>[Bernard]: Hold on a minute here I have the whole thing covered everything up , I will hit share screen there alright. You see this ?<br> 伯：稍微等一下，我这边整个图片盖住了其他东西。我会点击这边的分享屏幕，你能看到吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Nope, just a little round thing which is a head of man I think<br> 凯：不能。只有一点圆圆的东西，可能是一个人的头。<br>[Rick]: You should be able to   share screen and window will come up with selection and you have to select,<br> 瑞：你应该能看到 分享屏幕的选项，然后会跳出窗口供你选择。<br>[Bernard]: Okay screen I will hit screen share and I will select screen share here<br> 伯：好的，点 分享屏幕，再选择我要分享的。<br>[Rick]: It should be a green button on the bottom of the zoom window, is that what you mean.<br> 瑞：应该是窗口下方有个绿色按钮，是这样的吗？<br>[Bernard]; I have got, share video, share screen, I have got it here okay now I will try to see if I can put my pictures up here. They are up. Can you see it, is there something behind if…<br>伯：我找到了。分享视频、分享屏幕，现在我找到了。让我来试试可不可以把照片放上来，好了，放上来，你们可以看到吗？<br>[Rick]; Instead of … Oh here we go I am starting to get it.<br>瑞：好的，我现在把它上传。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What are we looking at which one?<br> 凯：我们要看哪一张？<br>[Bernard]: These are just different things I got. This would be the unit there. i have some music behind it, can’t get my pictures into another department, this computer yeah. I don’t know mac can,,,<br>伯：这是我做的一些不一样的东西。这应该是我要展示的那个系统。我有设置背景音乐，我不能把照片放在另一个地方。这个电脑啊，我不知道MAC…<br>[Rick]; You could just be able to , you could<br>瑞：你可以…<br>[Bernard]: I will show you the video first, i have a video up here, maybe we should go through that quickly, it just give you an idea, it show you unit working. It is function and probably has been for 18 days now hooked to the house<br>伯：好的，我先给你看下视频。我这里有个视频，可以浏览一下，给你们做个参考，我要给你们看的是正在运行的装置。我把它挂在房间里，大概已经运转了18天。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: And what deduction can you see<br>凯：你能推断出什么结论？<br>[Bernard]; I have been keeping tabs on my smart meter and stuff and yeah things can calm down considerably, i don’t know how, i think my , excuse me ?<br>伯：我一直在关注智能电表，事情很快就能稳定下来，我想，怎么了？<br>[Mr Keshe]: How much ?<br>凯：有多少？<br>[Bernard]; In 24 hours there was probably about .87 on the meter and it down 33 in a span of 17 days but i think what is showing is the.<br>伯：经过24小时，电表上显示的是87，经过17天，就降到了33.<br>[Mr Keshe]: You are in North America or in America<br>凯：你是在北美还是美美国？<br>[Bernard]  i am in Canada, Eastern Canada<br>伯：我在加拿大，加拿大东部。<br>[Mr Keshe]: I thought you were in America. you are on the 2 phase system?<br>凯：我以为你在美国。你是二相电系统吗？<br>[Bernard] Yes<br>伯：嗯。<br>[Mr Keshe]: That is why, we said when you are on a 2 phase system we get 66% that is what you are going to get you get 66%<br>凯：问题就在这里。当你是二相电系统的时候，要达到66%，也就是你也要达到66%。<br>[Bernard]: Yeah but later i think my smart meter reversed polarity or did something and they caught on to it and at one point, it dropped 400 point one night and the next morning it started climbing again. but what happened i think what is showing on the meter is what is going out into the grid. This is what i think is happening<br>伯：但之后我想我的智能电表可能是反极性才会这样，曾经一夜之间还一度下跌了400点，第二天又回升了，但我想电表发生这种情况可能是输电网的原因，我现在也是这样想的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yeah the positions. I have seen something very interesting you will see this is what it is, because you are pushing on2 phases you are forcing the 3rd phase to accept which is this is way in india -Europia single phase connections online, in the 2 phase you are forcing the 2 phases are forcing the 3rd to phase to reverse,its possible. This is something that  we have seen that in the factory in the elevation now you could understand why one of the phase is 0<br>凯：是的，相电系统的位置因素。我之前也见到过这样的奇事。因为你在推进二相电系统，你又迫使三相电系统接受它，这是印度-欧洲单相电系统线上联系使用的方式，因为处于二相电系统，却要使两相电系统迫使三相电系统倒退，这是可能的，也就是我们看到的关于工厂电量的问题，现在你就能理解为什么会有一个相电系统是0。<br>[Bernard] But now i getting charge…<br>伯：但我现在充电的时候。<br>[Mr Keshe]: you are getting charged what<br>凯：你要充什么电？<br>[Bernard]; Now what is happening is, i went online to check my readings when it was close to, just my bill. There was some bit of confusion, it was 0 balance and nothing would come up,and then finally i got my bill, they had a little note on it, if you disconnected, done construction, but something was not adding up in their department or something was adding up on it in your apartment, they finally billed me for what i have been pushing in the meter, because my meter is just showing what has been, something being drawing in but what is happening  it’s showing what  is going out. That causes the confusion<br>伯：现在的情况是当快要到我交电费的时候，我上网核对电表读数。那么问题来了，电表显示的是0度，而且没有异常情况，最后我拿到了账单，上面有个通知，询问我是否断开电路，自己建了一个电路系统，或者是你在公寓里放置了什么设备，后来，他们按照智能电表的读数收取的电费，因为我的电表显示的就是它使用的电量。但是，现在发生的事情是已经过时了的。这给我造成了一些困扰。<br>[Mr Keshe]: So they are taking power from you<br>凯史：所以他们是在你身上拿走能量<br>[Bernard]: Their charge would be for what is showing on the meter .but what is showing on the meter is im pretty sure  is it is what i am putting into the line.<br>伯：他们是根据电表显示收费的。但我确定电表显示的是我在线路上所使用的。（他没使用供电局提供的电量，但电表还是在计算他在房间里使用的从能量装置获取的电量）<br>[Mr Keshe]: Is there any difference between it<br>凯：这两者有什么不同吗？<br>. [Bernard]: :Oh yeah i have done some tests with it here, i back off on a few things, i even unhook the system  yesterday, and what was showing on the meter went down to just a trickle, that means I wasn’t putting anything into it but my load in the house was still running continuous.<br>[Mr. Keshe] I see you have that in the 2 phase I have seen a more strange thing in a 3 phase. I am gonna explain to When I explained to you something which we have explained to the energy suppliers that is why they aren’t very happy with us. I will let the cat out of the bag<br> 伯：有的，我做了一些测试。我撤下了一些东西，昨天还把整个系统解开，而电表上显示的参数也是涓涓细流，这意味着，虽然我没有放置任何东西，但是整间房子还是有电流在不停运转。<br>凯：我知道你在二相电系统中出现的这种情况，我在三相电系统中曾遇到过更奇怪的现象。接下来，我会告诉你们之前向能源部官员的解释，尽管并没有使他们满意：我会让真相大白。<br>[Rick; can we see a picture there Bernard ?<br> 瑞：我们能看看你拍的图片吗？<br>[Bernard]: I am going to let another cat out of the bag, all them transformers on the telephone poles, probably closer to my house, they all going to be nano coated, those will be little reactors I think.<br> 伯：那我要让另一个真相出来，电线杆上的转换器，由于比较靠近我的房子，就要变成纳米涂层的小型反应器了。<br>[Mr Keshe]: yeah, let me explain to you something very interesting, do you want to show something and then I explain,<br>凯：让我给你讲一个很有趣的现象。你想要展示什么吗，之后我再讲。<br>[Bernard]: I will show a little explanation, working unit here, there maybe some music come on I will try to kick it off<br>伯：我会简单说几句。这就是工作系统。可能会有一些背景音乐，我会把它关掉。<br>[Mr Keshe]; Yeah take the music off, we don’t want pay a penalty for you<br> 凯：好的，请把音乐关闭。我们可不想为此替你交罚款。<br>[Bernard] Let me just turn that off right away. I will have to scroll through all these stuff here, if is the right one<br>伯：我现在把它关了。我会拉动滚动条让你们好好看些这些配件，看看是不是这个。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Is that your stacker ?<br>凯：这是你的存储器吗？<br>[Bernard] Yeah there is music behind it , i can’t explain. i have coils all over. all the way around it, they are in star formation and that piece in my hand that feeds the bottom. it is a nano paste in there with foil and stuff and i have other coils in series wrapped around it, the plasma battery  is also…. here as you can 2:53:00see in the bottom are in star formation and i have got one big plasma battery in the centre and there is a coil directly up top over that but that plasma battery is connected to the bottom coils. The system feeds in at from the tuck and starts at the bottom star formation coil so these are positive negative flow coils. Where my thumbs are …<br>伯：这是有音乐的，我也不知道该怎么解释。我把这个存储器的四周都围上了线圈，就是那个星型组合，我手上拿的这个东西是放在底座为其提供动力的。它是纳米涂层的金属薄片，这是缠绕在外围的其它线圈，还有等离子电池。底部的这种结构就像星型组合，在中间，我放了一个很大的等离子电池，还有一个线圈是直接连到顶部的，但是等离子电池是与底部线圈相连，整个系统从底部构成星型结构的线圈开始供能，通过线圈进行传递，这些是正负极电流线圈。我拇指放的这个位置是…<br>[Mr Keshe]: What does this system do ?<br>凯：这个系统是做什么的？<br>[Bernard]; It produces the power that i am talking about, those are the power batteries, i have 6 of them on top, there are tied in series together but they are tied in parallel when they get to the bottom of the system but it is  a bit complicated but i put the theory to use here and it works, actually i think it is quite powerful i am not sure how much it puts out but  i don’t know if i can unnute this quickly<br>伯：我说的这个是提供能量的。这些是能量电池，我在上面用了6块电池，并把它们系在一起，并且是平行放置的，底部的系统有些复杂，但我用了您之前讲过的理论，它就可以运行了。这个系统能量巨大，我不确定他能释放多少能量，但是我不知道,如果我取消静音（噪音出现）<br>{from video}</p>
<p>This is just from the battery setup right now, i thought i had 3 weeks on the battery<br>刚刚是从电池装置上发出的，大概使用了三周。<br>[Rick]: the thing is the music and stuff, what you can is screen share without the audio<br>瑞：关键是你的背景音乐和其他杂音，你可以在分享屏幕的时候可以把音频关闭。<br>[Bernard] Can you hear me now? i guess i will explain.It is just a battery charger, it is a computer right. it runs on its own ，right now, i have got he system tied into itself. It is strong enough to feed itself plus there is, i am running about 800Watts on that and it was 500 Watts showing on the inverter so i was getting basically 300 Watts this was all in the testing stage when i was getting the system goingleft here for 3 weeks before i tied it to the house grid. So  there are other systems, so basically we have seen this. i’ve got some picture i can show you if you want to see can you still hear me ?<br>伯：你现在能听到我说话吗？我可以向你们解释一下。它只是一个充电器，现在成为一个计算机了，它现在正在运行。整个系统是绑在一起的，能量巨大，可以自给自足，现在功率大概是800瓦，逆变器上显示的是500瓦，所以剩下的300瓦基本上是供我使用了，系统还在继续测试，这个系统在我把它加入房间的供电网络前，已试运行了3个星期。有其他系统，基本上我们已经看到了这个。我有一些照片，我可以告诉你，如果你想看到你还能听到我吗？<br>[All] Yeah 可以<br>[Bernard]: I have a few different kind of photos. I am just trying to  scroll my computer so i can sorta picking my way round it, trying out stuff into it. I can’t seem to get it out of this section here with all the music. I will try this i will shut the music down but it shows in more in detail how i constructed this thing<br>我还有一些其它照片。现在我在拖动电脑的滚动条，希望能找到需要的东西。我好像总是不能把音乐去掉，再让我试一下，我会关掉它的，这里有很多我建构这个系统的细节。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Can you stop the music please, it okay stop it because it can cause us problem. We donnot want have problems.<br>凯：你能把音乐停下来吗？请关掉她，因为它会给我们带来一些困扰。我不希望出现这样的问题。<br>[Rick]: What you can do is on your screen share is to not select to do the audio feature and see if that might help. You might have to reselect you screen share without the audio feature<br>瑞：你可以在屏幕分享对话框中上不要勾选音频功能，看看有没有用。这样的话，你可能要重新选择分享屏幕。<br>[Bernard]: Rick can you still see my screen,<br>伯：瑞克，你现在还能看到我的屏幕吗？<br>[Rick]: Yeah we still see your screen<br>瑞：可以。<br>[Mr Keshe]: You music is safe, your mac is safe. oh you are a mac user<br>凯：音乐停了，电脑好了，你现在已经是MAC的用户了。<br>[Bernard]: yeah they just hacked in and burnt my other system. I was under attack for quite a while here with stuff i was posting. Yeah now they will be more difficult to get because things are encrypted.<br>伯：是的，他们只是攻击电脑上的其他系统。前段时间，他们总是黑进我的电脑，查看我的帖子。现在他们就很难做到，因为我把所有文件都加密了。<br>[Rick]; What you have to do is re share  your screen stop the screen share and re share it<br>瑞：你现在可以重新分享视频。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Let me explain to you a little bit about how you get hacked because a lot of people are getting this problem. It coming through your skype. It done professionally, it’s done by NATO Belgium and Germany and we know who is doing it are. Do not  use your skype for communication on your laptop. You can do the skype on your mobile they can’t  get android mobile they can’t touch at the moment. but this done by, these professionals they come and send you something by skype and they come  in through Belgium and Germany.<br>凯：让我给你解释一下你是怎么被黑客攻击的，因为很多人都遇到了这个问题。这是北约、比利时和德国的专业人员通过Skype账号黑进你的电脑，我们知道谁是谁做的。不要在上笔记本用Skype聊天。你可以在你的手机上用Skype，他们一时还不能黑进Android手机。但这些专业人员会通过Skype给你发东西，这些人主要是比利时人和德国人。<br>[Bernard] They got into my other computer that way they pretty much put a nasty virus, but skype, i don’t even have skype anymore i have this livestream here and<br>伯：他们进了我的电脑，很可能把讨厌的病毒植入我的电脑中，但说到Skype，我甚至都没有Skype账号，一般都是用直播，<br>[Mr Keshe]; Yeah it is the skype they use it, it is the same thing that they damaged our system. It is untrue the same people and everybody knows who they are by now. Especially in Germany they are Hackers and in Belgium there are part of the structure of the government to damage as much as they can. We have seen what they have done and what they do.<br>凯：他们用的Skype，这与破坏我们的电脑系统是一样的原理。虽然很不真实，但这都是同样的人，其它人都知道他们是谁。尤其是在德国，他们都是黑客，在比利时，他们有一部分是政府机构的工作人员就任意破坏。我们也都知道他们都做了什么。<br>Since that it is finished now they can pickle as much as they like ,it will be a waste of time and whatever they like. We will make announcement in respect to these things very soon and  i think just to let me advise you do not use skype, do not post anything with connection with a skype connection on your mobile that come and destroy everything. It is done by people we know who they are, they are in a post and the people who understand the role law in different countries but i do apologize we go the same situation most of us got  stranger on the Keshe foundation. people work round the foundation and people post about the foundation then get done. It is a very nice job they are doing it, they get very well paid in thier accounts in swiss banks and the German banks but the German banks and the international banks system is watching what they are doing and the ones who are doing because the money is going in literally in a very very back door way. 既然已经结束了，他们就可以任意破坏，这样很浪费时间，但他们喜欢。很快，我们会就这些事情发个通知，建议你们不要使用Skype，不要通过Skype发布相关的帖子或是在手机上用Skype发帖，否则他们就会毁掉你的所有东西。我们都知道他们是谁，他们有自己的岗位，了解不同国家的法律。我也要道歉，我们都有遇到同样的情况，很多人都在凯史基金会发现一些陌生人。他们在这里工作，发布一些关于基金会的信息，然后就被攻击了。这些黑客从事的工作很轻松，而且高薪，他们在瑞士银行和德意志银行的账户上都有一笔不菲的存款，不过德国的银行和国际银行系统会密切监视他们在做什么，谁在做，因为这些钱毕竟都是通过非法途径转入的。</p>
<p>(03.00.21) i have a very good news for you if i can add Keshe foundation pen and  the pal have been certified as a medical equipment. We got the medical certificate it has been done yesterday and we have been equipment too .if they would have given us one we would be able to advertise. but because of his work he has gone into certification 2 will take us a few more days to do all the final bits. we have make a lot of paperwork background for it. It has recognised as a health medical health system not as an alternative.<br>我现在有一个好的消息要宣布，凯史基金会的止痛带与医疗笔已被认证为医疗机构。我们昨天拿到了医学认证，也配备了一些设施，如果他们给我们1级，我们就能登广告。但由于他们的工作原因，他已开始认证2，这将多耗费几天时间来完成最后工作。我们已经做了大量的文书工作，现在它已被认证为一种医疗健康保健系统，不再是一个替代品。<br>it is said quite an essential tool which allows still to advertise but not the way did without going public with it, but we really have to negotiate to bring it down to 2 than the full medical system. Then nobody could have advertised to see it to get the website that we have to come to a standard, you cannot advertise for aspirin. You cannot advertise for anything which is medical one  and have we been lucky and we managed to negotiate our team managed to negotiate with the teams at Keshe that it has been recognised hopefully when we release the good in january<br>这些产品变得很有必要，且允许做广告，但不能以公开方式，不过我们还是要协商，降到2级，而不是完全的医疗机构。那就没有人会通过广告看到我们的网站，此外，还要设定一个标准，不能用来广告阿司匹林。你不能发布任何关于医疗的广告。我们已经很幸运，接下来还会设法与凯史基金会的团队协调，我们已经被认证，相信会在一月份发布好消息。<br>  it carries this health CE certificate as a medical equipment and i can congratulate Keshe  team in the fine tree they are working very hard to get this done and so the way because we done the pens and the pad different with the way it was done China. It is done under the European regulations the materials has been changed to be in the regulations to have a C certificate to be out ,but our management and the new director we brought in. they decided we are doing such a fantastic thing they treasure it and we have been given health certificate 2 which is we can sell it as medical equipment but what are some restrictions during advertising is  which we have to follow our lawyers . As i said we have just in the company now they are seeing how we can advertise.<br>我们的医疗设备都有CE健康证书，祝贺凯史团队不断生根发芽，每个工作人员都辛勤工作，才把这件事情完成，我们做的笔和垫子和中国做的不同。因为是按照欧洲标准评定，所以材料都要改到符合规定改变，这样才会有一个C级证书，不过我们新派来的管理层和董事都认为他们在从事一项伟大的事业，都倍加珍惜，我们得到了健康证书2，就可以作为医疗产品出售，但对于发布广告有哪些限制，我们要听从律师的建议。正如我刚才说的，我们刚到他们公司，他们就在考虑我们如何做广告。<br>we had to remove some wording to the structure then it will be the leaflet which are  accompanied will be certified as health equipment and is not of off the table or whatever we will see how far we can go but for the next 3 4 weeks all should be tied up somehow and you buy health equipment  certified CE health to authorized by or under the Euro regulations. there is a lot of restrictions and a lot of advertising but with them moving it to 2 still allows us to advertise but we cannot do it to 1. There is a possibility that the pad will move into section 1 in the next 12-18 months if they decide to do to but at the moment we do not see it that way but the pen has been marked for total health equipment, with the certification. it is not the way you do it .This is not the way has been done by a lot of people. i have modified it to be that way and hopefully we should be able to deliver this and we have shown it, i have it here  i showed the box to you.Just one second please.<br>我们必须去掉一些措辞的说法，宣传页也要符合医疗机构认证的标准和不发表与我们无关或是对未来愿景的话，但在未来3到4周都应该实现一定程度的联结，你购买的医疗设备都必须经过CE健康认证或是满足欧洲标准。<br>有很多限制也有很多广告，到2级仍然允许我们做广告，但在1级的时候我们不能像现在这样。如果他们决定这样做，在未来12-18个月，垫子可能会进入第一级医疗认证。只是目前还不知道；但笔已被认证为完全健康设备，还有认证书。这笔可能不是你们那样做的，很多人可能都没有这样做过，我们变换了一下，希望我们在正式发货之前展示这些东西，它就在这里，请等一下。<br>This is the exact copy of what you are going to get .without We have modified tip within the two stern within the regulation for the health equipment so it cost us a little bit more we had to change the casting because of the regulations and the pad has passed full certification<br>这就是你们很快就能拿到的样本。根据对卫生设备的相关规定，我们对笔尖两侧进行了一些改造，于是花费的成本变得较多。由于标准的限制我们必须要改变铸件。垫子已经完全通过认证。<br>[Rick] You want to start your video there Mr Keshe<br>瑞：凯史先生，您要播放视频吗？<br>[Mr Keshe]: I am just waiting for caroline. We are giving these units as a gift to as part of the world peace position. This is as strong as before. We even had to pay for the boxes to be redone because of the certification.This is the way you will receive it and we had the tip for health regulations. the tip was changed to comply to regulations to what we been asked to do, the ultimate shape and size is the this the tip might be slightly changed 17000 EURO we had to pay to be in the regulation.<br>凯：我在等卡洛琳。我们释放这些产品作为促进世界和平的一部分。这和以前一样强大。由于标准的限制，我们甚至还要付钱返工做这些盒子。你们收到的就是这种样式。为遵从规定，我们对尖头进行调整直至符合卫生标准。最终的形状和大小大概是这样的。为了满足规定，我们花费了大约17000欧来进行这些细微的改善。<br>This is the box you will receive it in. It is white in the backer, blue background and it is white  and blue sits in a white embedded with conventional folder to it. Everything we do from Keshe foundation manufactures has to be within the standard .now we all follow the boxes to be presentation the documentation and certification. we do not put anything out without certification.   and on the other hand we have received huge supports from the governments to launch these materials and we are expecting in coming days these major will be brought into this way.<br>这是外部的包装盒。笔是蓝底白边，放在一个白色的嵌入常规文件盒中。凯史基金会制造的一切产品都符合标准。现在我们看盒子里有操作手册和认证书。我们没有推出任何无关的东西。我们还从政府那里得到很大支持，从而发布这些产品，希望接下来能向大家推出这些产品。<br>because  we stop trying to do it even with the power units. We  took our time, we designed the power unit. The power unit which come out in January are different one which we are released now and maybe now we every unit that has been sold it manufactured and is sitting in the factory and it just a matter of shipping them out .<br>因为我们不再进行这些（寻求认证的事情），即使是能量装置。我们会好好利用时间，设计出现在的一个能量装置。一月份生产的能量装置和我们现在推出的不同，现在我们生产的每个单元可能已经售出，或者就等着准备装船。<br>All the tracking number are being issued on a daily  basis to the dispatch we holding as usu.al the only thing dispatch will start what we thought will be the blockage in the full stage.You will recieve an email from the dispatch that your material has been shipped .we even have a problem today a huge system of bars has gone missing. and we watching it appear how they tampered with it. We choose the time of the launch that dispatch to be within the highest traffic christmas time that it cannot be lose as many at least as possible.<br>But anything you have paid for, anything you have done reach with is manufactured it is just a process of packing and sending it out which we have  a limit of what we do because of the security check.<br>所有的追踪码都是精确到日，然后派发的，在平台完全不畅通时，我们会使用急件。产品发出时，你会收到一封电子邮件。我们现在也存在一个很大的问题，今天一个大件丢失了。我们看着它如何发生他们（黑客）如何篡改它。因为发件时间正处于流量高峰期的圣诞节，所以至少不会丢失很多。但你们订购的并被生产的任何东西将只是一个打包并发送的过程，在这个物流的过程中，由于安全检查的因素，我们能力受到很多限制（指的是难以追回已经发送的包裹）。<br>Even some of you today or tomorrow will receive a message from the foundation dispatch saying your system has been dispatched. We have seen some scare mongering by people putting on the fire and whatever these are the same people who are hacking the systems, it is a German group. But  i have to tell you one thing i know kevin drevver is on  the german group working.<br>你们今天或明天就会收到基金会发出的消息，说你们的产品正在派送。我们知道有些人总在危言耸听，这就是那些攻击你们电脑系统的人。这是一个德国团队，不过我要跟你们说，凯文就在这个团队工作。<br>Keshe foundation Germany has been registered on Tuesday as an independent registered company.Keshe foundation manufacturing is done so or will be done next week. but Keshe foundation germany is living entity in Germany legally, all those who tried very hard stop it i do apologise for your lose of effort.<br>凯史基金会德国分会在周二注册了一家独立的公司，凯史基金会生产厂这周或下周就能完成注册。不过德国分会是合法的实体企业，对于那些费尽心机阻止我们的人，我要说声抱歉了。<br>Congratulations to eric and kevin and richard who worked very hard. Keshe foundation germany structure  is specifically built for Germany. i signed the documents last week and Keshe foundation manufacturing Germany has already been signed all the documents for its establishment and it will be operating sometime in February hopefully and they are pulling on the back of the Armin and Silvestre to structure, the production nanocoating and the teaching team.<br>祝贺诶瑞克、凯文和理查德，他们都兢兢业业。凯史基金会德国分会的结构是专门按照德国标准建立的。上周我签署了一些文件，基金会德国分会的生产厂也已完成所有文件的签署，可能的话会在二月份开始正式投入运行，阿明和西尔维斯特也将回归基金会的结构中去，到纳米涂层生产团队和教学团队。<br>We will start manufacturing in 6-7 countries by February and in that way the number of document which is going to be released hopefully by Armen  this week. We had to modify the company agreement because amount of flaws into it and  something was missing. I has been hopefully done he was working on it to release today or tomorrow.<br>二月份，我们会在六到七个国家投入生产，到时，阿尔曼会发布一系列的文件。因为存在一些漏洞并且有些东西丢失，我们不得不对协议进行修改。我一直希望他能在今天或明天发布。<br>any of you have applied to become manufacturers and your request has been done, we sent you the documents and they will do the security check in background. Those of you who receive the form to register Keshe foundation in our countries we have build up specially for this purpose, the dual way to allow the maximum benefit to you nation and as i said congratulation germany and we are authorizing the establishment of Keshe foundation bulgaria as an independant the last we saw the people we saw an agreement with they have not done the job  .Keshe foundation Bulgaria is open for establishment from the people we requested from them  and they had a mandate they just never used it ,so keshe foundation Bulgaria can be produced because it is default for the people who set it that way, that’s to start to creating a Keshe foundation manufacturing, we did not get a response from our request ,so  we assumed that they will not do it  legally we are We are not bound to any such activity so Keshe foundation Bulgaria is open for registration but those of you who are opening the manufacturing the structure would be the same and the rest Keshe Foundation Manufacturing Japan has been registered in Tokyo, we have gone into the phase of preproduction with conjunction ,with one of the major work production companies.<br>申请加盟做生产商的客户，你们已经通过审核，接下来我们会给你们一些文件，他们对其进行安全检查。那些想要注册我们分会所在国的凯史基金会的客户，你们会收到登记表格为此我们专门建立了一套机制，希望通过双重方式实现让你的国家利益最大化，我说恭喜德国分会和我们已授权凯史基金会建立一个保加利亚独立分会，后来我们发现签署协议的人并没有做这项工作。保加利亚分会是应那些人的要求创办的，他们受到委托管理却从没用过，所以保加利亚分会是他们违约建立的，然后开始创建凯史基金会生产厂，我们的要求一直未得到回应，所以我们估计他们不会依法运营，我们一定不会从事这样的活动，所以保加利亚分会仅供注册，建立制造厂的程序是一样的。凯史基金会日本制造厂已在东京完成注册，是与一个主要生产企业联合，现在进入了试运行阶段。<br>They have started pretesting and production should be established in the next few weeks we will support heavily the Keshe foundation China as a major cooperation. we will send documents to the Chinese governments for our investment into the Chinese Keshe foundation collectively diving that we are writing a cross which means in far enough Keshe foundations in China that’s directly from the Keshe foundation Headquarters in equal basis, if they need it. If they can do it themselves ,we will not do because we see china as part of our support for Africa<br>他们已经开始预试和生产线会在接下来的几周建成。我们会大力支持中国分会成为主要的生产商，接下来会发送文件给中国政府，办理为中国分会投资的相关事宜。这就意味着远在中国的分会在平等的基础上直接听命于总部，如果他们想要依靠自己，我们也不会干涉，因为我们认为支持中国项目是我们支持非洲的一部分<br>The other point which have to inform you is that Keshe foundation as a spaceship organisation has been separated from the Keshe foundation FSSI .we have a Keshe foundation website. We have a Keshe foundation SSI is  the teaching division and the Keshe foundation has a spaceship independent institute has been setup so KFSSI is and has become independent from SSI. the Space Ship Institute has become as it was set up spaceship institute.org has received its own website.has been seperated(03.15.07)<br>还有一点我们必须要告诉你们，凯史基金会作为研究宇宙飞船组织已从凯史基金FSSI分离。我们有基金会的网站。我们有基金会SSI的基础教学部，凯史基金会设立了独立的太空飞船学院，因此，KFSSI独立于SSI。SSI已建立自己的网站spaceship institute.org,并且已经分离了。<br>Is it up Vince?  文斯，网站建成了吗？<br>[Vince] We are waiting for the confirmation to come through on the other end of the site<br>[Mr Keshe]; It’s okay you can go ahead .I have received the documents. It is still the same house we are just changing holding site.<br> 我们正在等待确认通过另一端的网站<br>凯：好，你可以继续做你自己的事。我已收到文件。还是同样的地方，只不过我们改了网站管理方。<br>[Vince]: Right we need to work on that in the background<br> 文斯：我们还是在这个环境下工作。<br>[Mr Keshe]: so now Keshe foundation as of more of less this week we have Keshe foundation.org. we have KFSSI which is a teaching arm and as I said early on with respect to SSI as I said to presentation of Ali that what we are about to do the spaceship institute.org is established as a spaceship program .<br>凯：那么，凯史基金会至少会在本周成立网站，Keshe foundation.org。KFSSI负责教学，像我之前向阿里介绍的关于凯史SSI的信息，我们要做的spaceship institute.org 是太空飞船项目。<br>you will understand the reason we done it. so it carries its own logo which is a blue circle on its own. KFSSI stays with the blue logo with the circle around it. I just received text from our lawyers that the registration is completed.SO we have 3 sides KFI ,SSI which is a teaching arm headed by Marco. Keshe foundation as a mother,as a parent stays the same and from now we have space ship institute.org as a space program, separated from teaching and separated from the foundation.<br>你们会明白我们这样做的理由。它有自己的标志：蓝色圆圈里是KFSSI和一个蓝色标志。律师刚刚给我发了信息，KFSSI已完成注册。这样，我们就有3方KFI，SSI是由Marco领导的教学分支。凯史基金会是母体，现在我们的宇宙飞船项目、教学和基金会都是相互独立的。<br>This is done  because our collaboration with the government in announcing the establishment of no border ,no nation, work  one country to develop the space program as an independent space ship. If we achieve what we are working on in our coming time, we will announce one of the major cities as the spaceship city. Which means where as you have Cape Carrol as part of Nasa , Kesh foundation has found home for its space program in collaboration with the government. If we manage to sign the document in the next 2-3 months we will have a space launch centre within the world organisation which means we had to do this ,to separate the spaceship institute as organisation devoted to a space ship program and if we receive we hope one of the things we hope to receive it during the holidays and we will announce a city which will be based in, based at, we operate through and we are home for launches.<br>这是因为在与政府合作时，就在宣传建立没有无国界，共同开发空间项目。如果我们在未来能取得一些成就，我们将宣布其中一个主要城市作为宇宙飞船城。这意味着，哪里有Cape Carol ，它就是NASA的一部分，凯史基金会与政府合作的空间项目有实验基地。我们会努力在未来2到3个月完成所有文件的签署，作为一个世界性的组织，我们会有自己的空间发射中心，这意味着我们必须做到这一点，宇宙飞船研究所要单独作为一个组织从事宇宙飞船项目研究，希望我们能在假期中收到文件，如果可以，我们会尽快挑选一个城市作为项目运行和飞船发射基地。<br> This has taken us a long step but now that the site has been done as you heard. the site is ready spaceship institute.org as in independent space program is more or less launched. We will have a home base, launch base and a whole organisation base and we hopefully receive the support for and receive the agreement for a couple more organizations.<br>这已经使我们向前迈了一大步，现在网站已经建成，网站是spaceship institute.org作为独立的空间计划项目，算是投入运行了。我们将有一个基地，发射基地和整个组织基地，我们希望得到更多组织的支持。<br> the blue flags stays as the spaceship institute as not KFSSI. KFSSI is collaboration between the foundation and the work of the foundation which comes to the teaching as one of the 5 beneficiaries of the 90% of income of the foundation income and then the special issue which is part of the second line will come to operation, so we start going the direction we came and in so many ways, once the webmaster team put it on, you can from the Keshe foundation website got to KSSI or go to spaceship institute on its own.<br>蓝色的旗帜仍属于宇宙飞船机构，而不是KFSSI。KFSSI是基金会和教学部的合作机构，基金会90%的收入来自于此，因而是 5个收益机构中的一个，还有一个关键问题，第二条线将会很快投入使用，我们要开始我们做最初的方向，很大程度上，一旦网站管理团队将它放上去，你就可以直接从凯史基金会的网站去KFSSI或者去太空船研究网站。<br> I would like to thank those in the government and authorities and people behind it who are listening today for the support .we ask them to listen and kept you the end .KESHE Founation foundation space institute if we manage to finalize the paperwork without any interference .we will have a home base city launch and the name of the city we will call the home of the space ship program. We have a very good backers hopefully they can complete the problem and then we can go as we are planning to do. I think we are long enough into this it is nearly 12.20 we can call it a day for today<br>我要感谢那些听了我的发言，感谢政府和权威机构的工作人员、幕后工作者一直以来的支持。我们希望你能一直听下去，并保持你们的支持。如果我们能够顺利完成文书工作，凯史基金会空间所将有一个基地城市，我们已经想好这座城市的名称，就叫空间计划家园。我们有很多支持者，希望他们能顺利解决所有问题，然后我们就可以按计划进行项目。这段视频很长，现在已经将近12点20，我们可以称之为特殊的一天。<br>[Rick]: Mr Keshe let me finish with a comment from someone from the last workshop shiwata emwa. she says dear Dr. Keshe  in this path of knowledge, we are bounding ourselves with the infinity loop that is you are linking us all together like a unit with the power of the margrave. The older lady holding a crystal with the coils made up by her own with limited resources like the candle of peace that was outstanding confidence that you have given us and the boy from Africa making gans from his own from his own body for treatment of malaria and successfully treat it also, this is now flowing as in the ancient Vedas. I don’t know about the real origins ， for me each unit is a shri yantra and the spaceship is the manna .this is really going towards beauty and perfection and to the universal law. thank you<br>   瑞：凯史先生请让我再读一个评论，是上一个工作坊的学员shiwata ewma。她说，亲爱的凯史博士，在这条知识之路上，我们团结在一起，不断学习，你把我们连到一起就像一个磁引力场的动力机制。老太太利用自己有限的资源，手里拿着缠绕着线圈的晶体，分外安详，而这种自信是您带给我们的，来自非洲的孩子，用gans为自己治疗疟疾并且治愈，这就是不断流传的Vedas，真正的起源我无从得知。对我来说每个能量单元就是shri yantra ，宇宙飞船就是我们的家人。我们不断走向完美，这就是普遍规律。谢谢你。                                                                                             [Mr. Keshe]: You are welcome hopefully .we will be able to announce new changes in the new year in a very positive direction our people are working on a background very hard. Even during the holidays to make sure it happens we were surprised even the people in the factory wanting to be back. Just taking 2 days off just today and tomorrow, they start work again on Saturday because they have seen how the power units will report changes to them .because they have seen that they are using it themselves and we will increase  research, new products will be announced by the innovation centre .we are looking for a huge number of people to employ for the foundation .<br> 凯：不用谢。我们会在新的一年实现更多改变和突破，我们的工作人员正在努力工作。即使在假期，也要保证工作正常运行。我们非常惊讶，工厂的人想要快点回来工作。今和明两天是休息时间，他们在星期六要开始工作，因为他们能看到这些能量装置会给我们带来多大的改变。因为他们自己也在使用，我们会加大研究力度，创新中心会不断发布新产品，我们正在不断地为基金会招纳大量人才。<br>[Rick]; The Chinese call it the happy box I wonder what the Italians call it<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What do you mean?<br>[Rick]: Well the Chinese call it the happy box because it makes them feel happy when they go into the room.<br>瑞：中国人把它称为幸福的盒子，我想知道意大利人怎么称呼它？<br>凯：你说的是什么？<br>瑞：中国人叫它幸福之盒是因为当他们走进房间的时候，他们会感到很高兴。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: There are 3 more reactors on the way to Chinese. I have to explain that with the setting up of the factories, we are looking within the Keshe foundation family to employ across the world between 30000-50000 in 2016 -2017.<br>凯：有3个反应器正在送给中国的路上。我必须向你们解释，为建立工厂，凯史基金会将会在2016、2017年，从世界各地招聘30000-50000名工人。<br>we have opened the site as the factory’s build up as the production and the new materials comes we are looking to build the structures between the Keshe foundation supporters. if you know about Nano coating.if you will know about the gans making you have done enough work with the plasma technology please get in touch with the factory section because I know the Armin need a lot of people to do the job.<br>我们已经建立工厂，生产产品和新材料，这是我们在凯史基金会的支持者之间建立的结构。如果你知道你会知道纳米涂层技术和gan 的制作工艺，还有与等离子体技术相关的从业经验，请与工厂联系，阿尔曼需要很多这方面的工作人员。<br> He is going to get things from the Germans for a couple of weeks I think, to make sure things go the way they  ought to do it .putting industrial teachers or plasma teachers to teach the factory worker. We need to teach the people before we teach the factory so that we know. I congratulate Armin for his hard work. he had to work very hard in the back background as a devout man to the technology. In so many ways, as I pull away from the teaching site and all you thought I’m just not going to teach But I teach only one day a week in in institute because most of my work from now on goes to what we just announced {sound error}<br>几周之内，他将在从德国人那里得到一些东西，以确保事情正常运行。招聘工业技术教师或等离子教师给工人培训。我们要在工厂运行之前先教人。我还要感谢阿尔曼的努力工作。作为一个对工作要求严格的人，他一直在幕后努力工作。很多时候，当我没有参与教学视频制作时，你们都认为我只是不去教书，我一周只在研究所上一天课，以后我的大部分工作都是刚刚提到的一些项目。<br>So the reason that I pull out of the teaching so much, it will be done by the teacher, by the new teachers which Mark is setting up because we have to see the development of the space ship city and making this thing takes a lot time. And I will be heading the space program in the spaceship city if we come to agree on the final pieces, so there will be less teaching by me in a way in balleta but the expansion of the teaching goes to Macho with the team if the teachers he setting up.<br>所以我不再那么多的参与教学工作，是因为它们是由新老师来做的，让这些马克培养的新老师来教授，因为我们必须促进空间计划家园不断发展，这件事要花费很多精力。如果我们最终达成一致建议，我将去空间计划家园从事飞船项目的研究，所以之后会很少出现在教学视频中。整个教学团队将是由Marco来引导。<br>I thank Marko for his hard work he was even there yesterday he hasn’t gone home for Christmas yet, we met on Monday now he still working, Stanley and Macho setting up the entire teaching as a structure. We will open the African teaching centre with the help of Macho and Alex and we are hoping to open if we can get any kind of work done in the US teaching centre. but you don’t need to move from you continents to come to Europe. This is what Marco is planning in the background, as far as I know. We are hoping that we come to some form of collaboration with the Chinese to open directly teaching centres in china.<br>感谢马尔科，他工作非常努力，昨天都没有回家过圣诞节，我们周一会见的时候，他还在工作。斯坦利和马尔科会建立完整的教学体系。在马尔科和阿历克斯的努力下，我们还会推进非洲教学中心的建立，如果能够满足在美国的办学条件，我们也会在那里开设课程。你不需要从你所在的大陆来欧洲，据我所知，这是马尔科的计划。我们还希望能与中国大陆机构合作来办教学中心。<br>We might announce open centre somewhere in the destination of the spaceship city. we bring its own reach centre and own teaching centre and the capability and capacity has to be discussed that we can actually come to work within the spaceship teaching centre and work as developers of the spaceship program. We kept all this to the back end of the year now we have always received the first green lights and we have gone to the position to take over this position. so from this week on you will have keshe foundation,  you have KFSSI as a teaching arm,you have  keshe foundation spaceship institute on its own is going to be its own local separate.<br>我们还会在空间计划家园开设中心。我们开设自己的教学中心和评估相关能力和条件，事实上，我们可以作为飞船计划的开发者来飞船教学中心工作。我们把这一切都放在了年末，我们现在的工作一路绿灯，我们已经有能力掌管这些工作。所以，从本周开始，会有凯史基金会，KFSSI教学部，宇宙飞船研究所，这些都将独立存在。<br>The manufacturing will be done we are moving the manufacturing to a new location  with the offer we received from the Italian government, I thank the Italian authorities out television station some of our team have seen the pictures from station is the most modern on the edge of the station system we can have for satellite and internet and banking system I think we are the first to put an application in for the Keshe foundation bank which is not another company is called Keshe foundation banking system or the bank centre.<br>制造厂快要建成，根据意大利政府的邀请，我们会把新厂址迁在那里。感谢意大利当局电视台让我们的团队看到一些图片，它是在是最现代的车站系统边缘，有卫星和互联网和银行系统。我们应该是第一个使用凯史基金会银行的机构，这不是建立的另一个公司，它是凯史基金会的银行系统或银行中心。<br>We have all the facilities .it takes us a few months to get the formalities finished in the new year. we are not going to another bank like normal commercial bank all the factories of the Keshe foundation will bank with the same bank and all the credits all the payments all the sales, the income of the foundation will go through the same bank all of the organization of the bank we been told to authorise our own credit card, our collection of the money that we can get people to pay into the account very much like a pay pal system. We have been told primarily agreed it’s just a formality to put it in order .<br>我们拥有所有的设施，在新的一年里，我们要花费几个月的时间来完成这些手续。我们不会再去其他普通商业银行，凯史基金会名下的所有工厂的全部贷款、转账、支付、以及基金的收入都会通过这一家银行进行交易。我们已经接到通知可以办理信用卡，集资，可以像pay pal(支付宝)那样让人们进行账户交易。这基本上已经定型，只是将这种形式在规定范围内实行。<br>we have come a long way in 12 month but in the other hand it could not be done without the support of all of you around the world to bring the knowledge on the table for a lot of people. People make it they feed it they see it, they see the change in them we will show magical systems that are coming into operation now that the first 2 system had been accepted as a medical. Section 2 it has opened our door for the massive release of more medical systems. I will show you next week ,a new way of using your concentration regeneration of cells like if you have a heart problem, high blood problem where you can support without any internal operation to rebuild the cell, rebuild the tissue ,we start teaching it and release the equipment for it to be tested by the scientific world. As I said I thank Vince for the massive work he has taken on in the past 12 months and especially thank his wife who lets us have him in this way.<br> 我们在之前的12个月经历了很多，但在另一方面，我们都知道，没有你们的支持，这一切都无法完成。人们一点点看它起步，不断成长，随时注意我们的变化，我们将会向你们展示这个神奇的系统。它很快就会开始运作，前两个系统是作为医疗机构。在第2部分，它会为我们打开大门，发布更多医疗系统。下周，我会向你们介绍一个新的方法，可以根据你的血液浓度实现细胞再生，如果你有心脏问题，高血压问题，你可以在没有任何内部手术的情况下重建细胞，重建组织。我们会开始教学，推出设备，它会被按照严格的科学标准来测试。正如我说的，感谢文斯在过去12个月里所做的大量工作，特别要感谢他妻子的支持。</p>
<p>[Vince]: She welcomes you too  她说不用谢。</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: It is the same with Sandor and all of your who supported our propagation. We made a lot of sacrifices but I think it is paid up if we manage to finalise the spaceship city with the governor, rulers, the presidents of these countries, we go to the next step of the development of the space technology. We will see what happens our people have moved in position and I wish them all the best to complete this venture with the spaceship city.<br>还有桑德尔和所有为基金会的发展和传播做出努力的人。我们做出了很多牺牲，但我认为如果我们最终与政府、执政人员和领导人达成一致，建成太空城项目，这些付出就得到了回报。接下来，我们就进入发展航天技术发展的下一阶段。我们会看到人们各尽其职，我希望他们都好，可以完成这项太空城事业。<br>We will the support I wish I was with them but it is getting done, Especially if we have moved away from the position to let them do their job this bring a lot of support to the Keshe foundations internationally and we are not looking for recognition. we just want to carry on develop the system and today we Saw Ali showing us the first of what we said .         Thank you indeed, have a nice Christmas and as we said we come from the light we go back through the light .Thank you very much<br>我会永远支持你们，愿与你们同在，所有工作很快就要完成了。尤其是如果我们不在这里了，请让他们继续他们的工作，这会对基金会带来很多国际支持。我们并不是在寻找认同，我们只想继续发展这个系统，今天我们看到阿里向我们展示了第一个制造的飞船系统。真的谢谢你们，希望你们度过一个愉快的圣诞节，就像我们说的，我们从光中来也会从光中回去，非常感谢。</p>
<p>[Rick]: Thank you Mr Keshe and that ladies and gentle will be the end of the 93rd knowledge seeker workshop for Thursday December 24 2015 and we will see back again next week time and place<br> 瑞克：辛苦了，凯史先生。女士们、先生们，这就是2015年12月24日知识探寻者工作坊第93次课程，下一次课程我们再见。<br>End time 3.33.00</p>
