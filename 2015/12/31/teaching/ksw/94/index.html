<p>翻译：Paul MS.Liu<br>组织翻译者：阿若兰<br>（建立《等离子体学院》QQ群339101724）</p>
<p>Welcome everyone to the 94th Keshe knowledge seekers workshop for December 31, 2015, the last day of 2015 and it will be the last session for this year and I suspect Mr. Keshe will want to recap on some of this year’s activities and present a new picture for us from the for the new year speaking of new pictures have a new picture up there now from Sam smith on the margrave technologies information’s Facebook site. Okay I think we are ready to go Mr. Keshe are you there are still.<br>大家好，欢迎来到凯史太空学院知识寻求者第94期节目。今天是2015年的最后一天 – 12月31日，这是本年的最后一期节目，我觉得凯史先生可能会想要先回顾一下今年的部分活动,再为我们展示一些明年要看的新图片。说到新图片，这里有一张图片来自萨姆史密斯的磁引力技术信息。好的，现在我们准备听讲了。凯史先生，您还在线吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes still alive and kicking good morning, good day to you good evening, wherever you wherever you listen to these knowledge seekers workshops as Rick said today is the last day of old year and tomorrow you start on a new year and hopefully it will be a new horizon for the Keshe foundation and suppose the knowledge technology and plasma. We have covered a lot and we have come with huge future progress with the Keshe in 2015 where we were blocked for years, now we progress very rapidly. We still see what I call the dark forces working really hard writing to the police and writing to the governments and to the banks and they made themselves a laughing stock at the moment because governments have realized this is a new Horizon there is a new technology and the beauty with it is, it has worth exactly what we tried to do since 2001-2012. The knowledge is carried by people not by one person. The point at this moment is not one name, the point is hundreds of thousands of people who are testing developing progressing the technology.<br>[Mr. Keshe]:在，依然精力充沛。无论在何地何时观看我们节目的观众们，大家早上好，白天好，晚上也好。就像里克说的 ，今天是将要过去的一年的最后一天，明天大家就会迎来新的一年，希望凯史基金会能有一片新气象，可以帮助我们等离子等新知识科技发展。我们已经涉及了很多内容，并且在凯史基金会的支持下，2015年我们克服了困扰多年的阻碍，取得了巨大进步，现在我们发展十分迅速。我们仍然能看到我所说的黑暗势力正在努力搞破坏，他们向警察揭发，向政府举报，还向银行写信。但是他们只是使自己成为了此刻的笑柄。因为政府已经认识到了这是一片新天地，这是一个新技术。它的美妙之处在于我们自2001年到2012年做的一切都完全值得。知识不是由一个人，而是由人们共同传播的。重点是在此时测试，发展和改进这个技术是由成百上千的人而不是由一个名字完成的。<br>This way what we collectively as Keshe foundation supporters in different languages nationalities colours or races of the one nation,one race one nationality one country one planet, have managed to change the course and this does not suit a lot of people. This does not a suit those who have been trying to suppress the new technology， this does not suit and those who get paid to disturb and destroy. We have seen recently some 50 emails patches flowing to the breeze trying（12分56秒） they can stop the process and the police just passes the information to us. We are receiving more.<br>我们作为凯史基金会的支持者应该是一个国家、一个种族、一个民族、一个星球环境下的不同语种，不同的肤色的人。我们共同努力改变这个课程的方式，但是这并不适合很多人，不适合那些极力抑制发展新技术的人，不适合那些收了钱来搞破坏的人。我们近来收到了50多封病毒邮件，企图篡改程序，竭尽阻止这个进程，警察已把这些信息传给我们。我们日后会受到更多这样的讯息。<br>They went to the Army. they went to the banks they have been to paypal, they have been everywhere but they don’t understand they can peddle as much as they like, it is not me anymore it’s you as a Keshe foundation members whose testing. We fail together we succeed together and we develop together and this development has changed a lot of things. In 2016 now that we have set the structure for all the teachings the only aim now is to develop the spaceship in a way that it’s a gives the man the freedom to travel in a way that we decide the shape of the spaceship, we decide the same shape of the craft that we would the passenger on. Some of you know some of you might not know I won’t disclose any further till we achieve ultimate position. Some of us were witnessed in the past 7 days to some tests and have been witness a number of tests in private where people have managed to create the elusive plasma condition, where they see colours as they are on-board of the spaceship, they see auras outside the buildings.<br>它们流向军队，银行，还有贝宝(全球最大的在线支付平台)。它们已经无处不在，但是它们不理解它们会尽可能的散播。这已经不再是我，而是作为凯史基金会成员的你们要测试的。我们一起失败，一起成功，一起发展。这个发展已经改变了很多事情。既然我们已经确定了课程的结构，在2016年我们的唯一目标就是发展宇宙飞船，以一种能够给予人们旅行的自由的方式，确定宇宙飞船的形状，确定我们送乘客上太空船的形状。有的人知道，有的人可能不知道，我们在实现最终目标之前不会进一步披露。我们在过去的7天见证了一些人做的测试，见到了很多私下完成的测试，他们试图创造难以捉摸的等离子环境，他们看到像在宇宙飞船上能看到的颜色，看到建筑物之外的气体。<br>Once we complete this technology and that way it is done the by people then we bring it out from now on we have brought everything on the control of the one roof that when we show the first spaceship it will be done in public. We are days most probably not more than weeks away from it because the elusive plasma condition which is the signature this planet with a blue background plasma has been achieved it has been recorded by the team of the Keshe foundation in the background and in the presence of a number people those who are online know what I am talking about they know they have been present.<br>一旦我们完成了这个技术，这个途径是要由人们完成的，我们就从现在开始把它挖掘出来。我们已经发掘的一切都在控制下，在一个“屋顶”限制下，也就是我们当我们展出第一艘宇宙飞船时它将在公众的视野中完成。我们距目标完成的距离更可能是按天计算而不是按周。因为难以捉摸的等离子环境成为这个有着蓝色的背景星球的特征。等离子已经实现了，他已经被凯史基金会团队记录下来。在这个背景下，成千上万在线的人们都明白我现在谈论的是什么，知道它们已经存在。<br>The next step for us is to balance the three layers of the plasma that we give it a physical tangibility. Hopefully this can be achieved in the coming weeks. The structure of work is on the hand（15分29秒） and we are testing on 3 different points on this planet that if one fails to other one can carry  but we don’t disclose one to another that we keep the stability. In fact what we have seen is what we set  and for two people who most probably are listeners  some people have been witness the condition of the balance plasma while you do not see what was in front of you has been achieved in two occasions. I know of a third and the fourth one but it is for them to come to front.<br>我们下一步要使三层等离子达到平衡，这是我们赋予它的物理有形性。希望这一步能够在接下来的几周内实现。我们已经着手准备这个工作结构。我们正从地球上三个不同的点测试，如果一个失败了，另一个可以继续进行。但是我们不会透露，我们保持稳定性。事实上，我们看到的就是我们设定的。两批人里，一些人最有可能是听众，一些人已经见证了等离子的平衡状态。而你们却看不到在当前两种情况下所实现的成果。我还知道第三种和第四种，但是他们必须要跟上来。<br>The technology from now on in 2016 he will be only directed in the direction of the manifestation of the plasma technology in a shape of a spaceship. I have talked and the people who understood are following and building I am not doing any more building I just teach and if you listen to the teachings of past most probably 3 to 5 months you have already managed to achieve that point you just need  direction. We will go through only plasma technology without matter  and in the past weeks we are concentrating on the development of plasma technology only, which means we will walk away from the matter states  we used a matter to create the plasma and we use the matter state as holding of the condition as a parameter holding  this is fundamental what this means is for example use of copper wires to make the coil but the copper is there just keep the shape  not to do anything else where the nano coating on the surface and will give us separation between the matter of the plasma states and the gans will give us the only plasma states.<br>从现在开始到2016年内，将只把技术用于指导在飞船形状的等离子技术的表现方向。我说过，理解我的人们都在追随和构建.我已经不再做构建工作，我只教课。如果你们听之前的课程大概有3到5个月，你们只需要一个方向，就能实现这个点。我们将实现没有物质的等离子体技术，在过去的几周里我们都集中在等离子技术的发展，这意味着我们将离开物质状态。我们用物质创造的等离子体，我们将物质状态作为为持有条件作为参数保持。这是基本原则，意思就是，比如将铜导线盘成线圈，铜线只是保持形状不做其它任何事情，在线圈表面涂上纳米涂层，我们将得到等离子体状态的物质和甘斯之间的分离，这个分离会给我们唯一的等离子体状态。<br>[Rick]: Okay. Go ahead there Mr Keshe sorry interruption,<br>[Rick]: 好的，凯史先生请继续。不好意思刚才打断了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  okay thanks very much, we going to have another interruption when they try to fix the computer. So what we are doing what will be done this year is totally concentrating on the use of plasma and the plasma conditions. As well be explained from the beginning that is all he was just mentioning that we use a copper for holding the frame to start with then we use the nano material for the interface between the plasma and the matter that he keeps the shape of the condition of the position of the plasma and we the gans and the plasma to use its properties for what we need. In a way the copper or any other material which we used to keep the shape of the plasma is just a tool   the nano coating is the magnetic field connection on nano layer between the plasma and the matter state. And then you have the property of the plasma which is on the gans states so what we have achieved in the past 12 months is understanding and producing a system which can be dictated to take shape as you need.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 好的，非常感谢，当他们要修理电脑时，我们会有另外一个中断。我们正在做的和将要完成的在这一年全部集中于使用等离子和等离子条件。正如前面的解释，他提到就像我们用铜保持形状，我们利用纳米材料当作等离子体和物质之间的界面，它保持等离子体的位置条件的形状。 我们使用甘斯和等离子体是为了利用它们的性质来满足我们的需要。在这样的方式中，我们以保持等离子体的形状而使用的铜或任何其他材料都只是一个工具。纳米涂层是在等离子和物质状态之间的纳米层的磁场连接。然后你将会得到在甘斯状态下等离子的性质。所以我们在过去12个月内实现的是理解和产生一个系统，你可以根据自己的需要支配该系统的形成。<br>In the space when we have stars， the stars to position of the galaxies dictate the shape in the environment they are. And they dictate the shape of the environment.  Here instead of having galaxies and universes and creating connection magnetically， we have used matter state， the gravitational and magnetic field strength to dominate and dictate the shape of the plasma. If any of you understood this  now you can start playing any games you like with plasma. This is what was missing, a few people have managed to make this simple understanding. You looked at the copper to make the nano material to give your energy or to give your medical applications  but what the whole purpose of whole teaching was to show you a simple tool  which the copper wire that you can dictate the shape of the plasma. The structural of the plasma the strength of the plasma and the position of the plasma. Very few races in the space have managed to achieve this but with the beauty of having the physicality of the matter on the planet it was very easy to develop it.<br>当太空中星星开始形成的时候，星星在星系中的位置决定了它们所在环境中的形状。他们决定了环境的形状。我们使用了物质状态，引力场和磁场的力量支配和决定等离子的形状，而不是由已有的星系和宇宙或者创造磁力连接施加影响。如果你们中有人理解，那么现在你们可以玩任何喜欢的等离子游戏。这就是缺少的东西，一些人设法使这个通俗易懂。你看起来铜能使纳米材料给你的能量，或者医疗应用但整个教学的整体目的是给你一个简单的工具 – 铜线，它可以决定等离子体的形状、结构、强度和位置，在太空中几乎没有可能实现这个目标。但是因为这个行星上存在物质的美妙性，所以比较容易发展。<br>The nano technology, the nano material which you have collectively developed in different ways but coasting by electric current by fire or whatever  has that advantage  that the matter the nano and the plasma is all the same   so connection is the very solid  is very strong. If you look at the nano technology industry in the commercial side, they take something they call nano and spay it or paint it they force, this for the first time that man has found the nano layer which connects the whole spectrum from the high power gravitational and magnetic field strength to the matter state  which he has control over. This has a huge advantage, this has a huge beauty for of those who understand how to manipulate it. You can manipulate the matter into the shape of the plasma you like, in the coming time you can replicate the structure of the galaxy by creating the boundary of it with a wire. You can nano coat the wire and create the fields and put in positions what you need to and see the effect of the position of the galaxy how you want it be. You can dictate the shape of the neutron plasma of an electron the plasma of an atom.<br>纳米技术，纳米材料是你们用不同的方式共同发展的，不过会被电流，火或任何能源耗费，但是它有一个优势，即物质，纳米和等离子都是一样的，所以连接非常紧密，非常强。如果你看看在商业领域的纳米技术产业，他们把一些他们所谓的纳米做成喷雾或油漆，这是第一次有人发现纳米层连接的整个范围包括了从高功率的引力场和磁场强度到被控制的物质状态。这有一个巨大的优势，这对那些懂得如何操纵它的人来说是非常美妙的。你可以将这个物质处理成你喜欢的形状的等离子体，在接下来的时间里，你可以通过用金属线构建出星系的边界从而复制出星系的结构。你可以用覆盖纳米的线来创造出一片领域放在你所需要的地方，并看到星系在你选定的那个位置会有什么影响。你可以决定一个电子的中子等离子体的形状和原子的等离子体的形状。<br>This is the freedom which was never there and is very hard to achieve but because we have managed to collect and create a single structure with the spectrum of the magnetic and gravitational field from the plasma high power  to the nano condition to the matter state plasma. This gives man a huge advantage in space. A huge advantage.  Now you can use the plasma to get what you need but you can condition the plasma by the matter state you very want it to be. The power of the plasma technology  the way we have thought  is beyond the imagination of the man.  It just needs to be explored and it needs to be understood by more and more people and in understanding it how to use it to what and what advantage we need.<br>这是从未有过的自由，是非常难以实现自由，但因为我们已经设法用磁场和重力场收集和创造一个单一的结构，这个结构从等离子体高功率，跨越到纳米状态，到物质状态的等离子体。这使人在太空中有一个巨大的优势，特别大的优势。现在你可以使用等离子体来获得你所需要的，但是你可以根据你想要的物质状态来决定等离子体。等离子技术的力量，我们思考的途径已经超出了人的想象能力。它只是需要被越来越多的人探索，理解，要理解应该如何使用它，用它来做什么以及我们需要什么样的优势。<br>Do we want to convert it into motion  do we want to convert it into food  do we want to convert it in emotion  we have a very large spectrum of the plasma strength in the hand of the man  up to now we only had the matter we hammered  we melted  we blow it  we did whatever we like with it  but it didn’t change state of the matter. The state of the matter state. Now you can create and control the plasma which is a mother of the creation of the universe   you are given the seed of the essence of the creation.  In the coming weeks we will announce the Keshe foundation space Centre as I said in one of the major cities in the world.<br>我们想把它转换成运动吗？我们想把它转换成食物吗？我们想把它转换成情绪吗？有一个非常大的等离子强度的光谱在人们掌握之中。直到现在，我们只有物质，无论我们怎样敲打它，熔化它，用风猛烈吹它，用它做我们想做的任何事，它都没有改变物质形态的状态。现在你可以创造和控制宇宙创造的孕育者——等离子体。你们被赋予了创造要素的种子。在未来的几周，我们将宣布凯史基金会的太空中心在一个世界上的主要城市已准备就绪。<br>The work is on-going  then we collectively bring you to the city to start developing  we make a central position from the city that it becomes space city.  In that case we collectively bring all human resources to complete this process within the next three months. Our target is 2016 in achieving full flight with a full control.  We are on target and preliminary test in three locations has confirmed for the creation of the elusive plasma  in a larger scale beyond boundaries even the matter state inside it.  We will do further tests and when we do further tests by tradition of Keshe foundation  will bring you live online. You become part of the structure  all of you have the full knowledge to do it  some of you have taken the step in the direction to test it. I have seen a lot of people making videos and calling us sect as a religious sect  and we have no sect we are not a religion  the religion and the people who call us sect are the people who want to cause fear among people.<br>这工作正在进行中，我们共同把你们带到这个城市，开始发展。我们选择城市中心位置使它成为太空城。在这种情况下，我们将在未来三个月内将所有的人力资源都用来完成这个进程。我们的目标是在2016年实现充分控制的全飞行。我们的方向是正确的。在三个地点的初步测试已经证实，在一个存在物质状态的更大范围内，产生了难以捉摸的等离子体的产生。我们会做进一步的测试，当我们做进一步的测试，我们会根据凯史基金会的传统为你们在线直播。你们成为了结构的一部分，你们有充分的知识去做测试，你们有人已经朝着测试的方向迈进了一步。我看到很多人制作视频，并称我们是宗教教派，我们不是教派，我们也不是宗教，而那些称我们教派的人是想引起人们的恐惧。<br>We teach the ethos of the universe what happens when you’re in the universe. All those people who made the coils and the still making the coils and connecting in the wrong way and then they blame instead of understood  is for the short coming. （30分10秒）We have delivered and continue to deliver all the units and all the technology which is developed   and we will do it from now on in conjunction with governments.  We work, we operate through government offices through government space agency’s which then take spaceship name.  At this moment we are working with 4 governments and Keshe foundation becomes coordinate on this spaceship program between the four governments. We have passed the individual cases in the house to build the unit use still can do  this is how we worked.<br>我们告诉大家宇宙的精神，当你在宇宙中的时候发生了什么。所有那些制造线圈的人，他们仍然在用错误的方式制造线圈和连接线圈，然后他们会归咎于他们不理解自己所看到的。我们已经实现并继续提供所有发展的单元和所有的技术，我们将从现在开始与政府合作。我们通过政府机关，通过宇航局工作和运作，然后给取太空船命名。与此同时我们和四个政府合作，凯史基金会负责这艘太空船计划在四个政府之间的协调工作。我们在房间已经通过了独立个案，要建立你们也可以使用的单元，我们就是这样工作的。<br>Now we work collectively with the governments to develop this technology or space technology or space ship program collectively as nations those who try to understand the technology we have to speed up to understand the totality of it  that you can join us in this adventure  is a huge program  and spilled on the back of the knowledge seekers who understood the teaching from the beginning. You got to understand how technology works. You go to understand how the technology of the plasma works  you got to look beyond the structure of the matter state, you got to look into the structure how the plasmas interact within the structure of universal plasma to gravitational magnetic field.<br>现在我们与各国政府以及各个尝试理解这项技术的国家共同努力，开发这项技术，空间技术或太空船计划。我们必须加快了解它的总体性，你可以加入我们共同参与这个冒险。这是一个宏大的项目，并藏在一开始就能理解课程的知识寻求者背后。你要理解技术是如何工作的。你要了解等离子体技术是如何工作的，你必须超越物质的形态来看这个结构，你要研究等离子体如何在宇宙等离子体到重磁场的结构内相互作用的。<br> Keshe foundation manufacturing are in the process of being developed and built and  structured in the next few weeks and months –Keshe foundation are built to structure to bring the people who do not have the technical knowledge but can support in other ways to build the structure one planet, one nation one race. We work collectively there are now so many people in the background putting the coils on the internet teaching each other, we see the establishment of the Keshe foundation Germany this morning around 12 o’clock 1 o’clock European time only start the submission that Keshe foundation French section of the Canadian sector. The foundation does not belong to no one and is not made up one anymore. You are developing it, you are a structure in it from today where we close to 2015 and the Christian calendar from tomorrow we will be still the same. We will still develop the technology in different names in different colours and different nationalities which they do not exist. It is beautiful when we see a Christian the Muslims the Jews and every other belief are working together to build up systems.We have already become one faith, we have already become one planet. When we saw the first what are called margrave systems beyond the boundary of the house in the test with the people were present,  I looked at it and I said if they could understand what this means.<br>在接下来的几个星期、几个月中，凯史公司将会处于发展和组建结构的过程，在这一过程，凯史公司将会把没有技术知识背景的人调动起来用其他的方式来支持建立一个地球、一个国家、一个民族。我们将与具有不同背景的人通力合作通过网络教大家制作线圈。今天凌晨欧洲时间大约零点至一点我们见证了凯史德国公司的成立，这只是凯史法国和加拿大分公司成立的先声。凯史基金会不属于任何人，也不是由某一个人建立的，是你们在发展它，你们是其中的一部分，从今天开始，2015年的年末，到明天，这一切都不会变，不同的名字、不同肤色、不同国籍的人仍会发展这项技术。当我们看到基督教徒、穆斯林、犹太教徒以及信仰其他宗教的人共同合作来建立同一个体系，那样的画面该多么美好啊！我们已经拥有了共同的信仰，成为同一个国家、同一个地球，当我们在场的人第一次见证磁引力场系统可以延伸到房屋范围之外时，我看着它，我说要是他们能明白这意味着什么就好了。</p>
<p>When we set up to star formation we spoke about the diamond structure and we show the diamond in the centre of the coils all. I explained to you that the fields will expand and if you have so many we achieve what we need. When we looked at the structure of the fields when the people went out of the house and could see the say that could see the fields beyond the house the same colour as what was in the house which is a bluish colour, I said to myself one thing little reactor in the room has expanded beyond and now if you can repeat the structure in 1,100,000 houses from around the planet, all these blue fuels atmosphere plasma to link up to each other and we create that condition which is peace.<br>当我们开始建立行星组合时说到过钻石结构，我们把钻石放到线圈中央，我像你们解释说磁场的范围会因此扩大，如果我们有足够多的钻石，就能获得我们所需的了。当其他人出去后，我们看着磁场的结构，他们可以看到屋内外的磁场都是呈蓝色的。我对自己说一个房间里的小反应堆就可以延伸到屋外，那如果在世界各地一百一十万间房子里安装相同的结构，所有的蓝色气体状的等离子相互连接，我们就能够创造和平的条件。</p>
<p>You bring the blueness part of the surface of the planet into the atmosphere of the planet and this is what I said because it is made from the co2 which is the emotional part of the body of the man and the man who made it in the other two men were making it and they are in that position because they have a peaceful soul, they are interacting and they will reach each other and then we change the breathing apparatus for this planet what we said the peace. People will work in next few months not knowing why we made the these arms, what are we going to do with it, why do we need to do these kind of jobs when in essence you build up a system to create the plasma which goes beyond the boundary of the house and the intention of the plasma is peaceful and if you link enough of them as we set then we changed a whole atmosphere of this planet and when I looked at the picture I asked Vince to show it to me again yesterday and I wanted to see confirmation it, because in the heat of the process we were trying to get things sorted to see what the facts are but with Vince he showed me the picture he say this is the zone where we see blue light outside the building.<br>你把地表的蓝色部分带到大气层中，这就是我们所说的，由于它是由二氧化碳组成，是人身体中的情感部分，一个人制造了这一部分，对另外两个也在制造这个装置的人产生影响，于是他们就达到了拥有平和的灵魂的状态，它们互动，互相联系，交换呼吸，使这个星球达到所谓的和平状态。在接下来的几个月之中，人们会继续工作，但对于我们制造这些装备的理由、用途毫不知情，它们工作的核心就是要创造出可以突破房屋边界的的等离子体，制造这种等离子体是出于和平的目的，如果把足够多的等离子体联合起来就能改变整个地表的大气结构，昨天当我看到这幅景象时，就会让文斯再给我展示一遍，我想再确定一遍，因为在这一过程最紧张的阶段我们想把事情整理清楚看看我们达到哪一步了，但是当文斯给我看那幅图时，他指着房屋外有些蓝光的地方，就是那儿。</p>
<p>It was a confirmation that we are correct and when we do these things we to do it as a team, we have the trust team amongst us to deliver what we have set. We can show you the elusive blue plasma around the building and the people say when they are walking in the house to see blue colour, shape plasma in the house it is the atmosphere that is that colour. This is how we look inside the spaceship when you may complete it. The blue colour is the blue colour of the planet earth it’s the interaction of the nitrogen with its materials which is oxygen and the carbon. You have to remember one thing dates is irrelevant, today is the last day of the Christian calendar or tomorrow is the beginning of another. The days are connected to another they don’t stop. In the Islamic world some have no idea what today is 99% of the Islamic world don’t even know what Christmas is all what is the meaning as much as the Christians don’t know when the new year of the Muslims or the Jews is.<br>它证实了我们是对了，我们在做这件事时是以一个团队在协作，我们相信自己的队员，相信我们之间传递的信息。我们能向你们展示环绕房屋周围的独一无二的蓝色等离子，人们也说当他们进屋时能看到屋内有蓝色的等离子体状的像是气体的东西，大气的颜色是蓝色的，当我们完成这一任务时，我们就能从太空飞船中看到呈现这样的颜色。蓝色就是地球的颜色，是氮气与氧气和碳相互反应形成的。你必须记住，时间无法逆转，今天是基督历的最后一天，明天开始又是新的一年。日子一天接着一天，永不停歇。在伊斯兰世界里，有些人根本不知道今天是什么，百分十九十九的伊斯兰人甚至不了解基督教，就像基督徒压根儿就不知道穆斯林和犹太徒的信念一样。<br>You’re working round-the-clock the Keshe foundation team is working a respectable time position religion country and now we achieve what we set out for once we adjust the 3 system around the world which are working and manage to balance the fields will give it a dimension to give the physical tangibility of the border exactly like your nano material and your plasma of the gans or matter state of the copper. We are in that state we will achieve it in the next few days or weeks and once we are hundred percent in the position to show not to create mayhem go live on it.<br>你是在按部就班的每天工作着，而凯史团队里工作就像一个相互尊重的以时间为基础的有信仰的国家，现在实现了我们所设定的。一旦我们调整分布在全世界的这三个系统，这些系统正在工作并在设法平衡场强，从而能使自己（系统）提高一个维度，并划分出有形的边界，就像你们的纳米材料和甘斯等离子体或者物质态的铜。我们已经处于那种状态，在接下来的几天或几周里将会实现。我们已做好十足的准备去展示而不是去制造一些能产生的混乱。<br>The beauty of it is with the new systems we tried not to use an electric current in we only use plasma energy. So we are making independent energy and the people who done it who have been testing in the innovation centre here and other places they all say the plasma when you use the nano coated material and the gans hence shows that its power is more powerful than the electric current.<br>新系统的魅力在于我们试图不用电流，我们只是用等离子体能量，所以我们正在制造独立的能量，在这里和其他地方的创新中心做过实验的人都说使用纳米涂层材料和甘斯产生的等离子体能量比电流的能量更强。</p>
<p>This is where we will be going next few days or weeks you will see the first spaceship the spaceship will be immediately and is structure be repeated a number of countries before we show in one place put positions in the study can be done that a number of people around the world can produce it. We know who and people who are in the stage of breakthrough will contact you. We ask you to adjust your systems and in adjusting simultaneously will show in three or four different nations that it cannot be blocked. This is the way we operate, this is the way we done our teachings maybe three people have achieved it will allow at least 5 to 10 groups around the world collectively repeat what is been repeated that can be shown in all locations at the same time that the technology cannot be stopped that the space opens to all man at the same time irrespect for the colours.<br>接下来几天或几个星期我们将从这方面入手，你们将会看到第一艘太空飞船，并且立刻会有许多国家复制这艘航空飞船，我们在展示它之前会进行研究确保世界上其他国家的人也能生产，我们知道正在寻求突破的人会联系你们。我们希望你们能调整你们的系统，同时在三四个国家展示以确保它不会遭到封锁。这就是我们工作的方式，这就是我们做教学的方式，也许三个人的研究成果可以使至少全世界五到十个研究小组收益，这个空间是向所有人同时开放的，无论肤色。</p>
<p>We have seen with a lot of shame the same people who will start with the third Reich in Germany making fun of the Keshe foundation which is investing heavily in Africa. Your times are finished division between colours and races the way you started the 1st and 2nd world war third world is finished. The blacks South Americans the new Zealanders Chinese to Japanese Asians on the Europeans would run at the same time that everybody gets the same and make sure of that and this is how Keshe foundation works. We have a jew in the Keshe foundation, people like Alvin and Allen one black one Arminian one American one Russian one living in London one is based in Nigeria.<br>我们很羞愧地看到同样一批人，他们从德国第三帝国开始就那样，取笑凯史基金会将大量投资花费在非洲。你们发动第一二次世界大战、根据肤色和人种划分区域时，你们的时代就已经结束了。南美洲的黑人、新西兰的华人和欧洲大陆上的日本人、亚洲人都会同时逃走，每个人都有同样的（逃走）机会，而凯史基金会运转的目标就是要确保它（人们获得自由的能力）。我们基金会里有犹太人像阿历克斯，像艾尔文，一个黑人一个阿梅里亚人，一个美国人一个俄国人，一个住在伦敦，一个在尼日尼亚。</p>
<p>We have a beautiful man like Benjamin who is opening the spaceship institute of the Ghanaian government inside. Ghana and Nigeria will be the jewel in the crown of to humanity for Africa. That a lot people in Germany cannot see it. And these are the people who live in Belgium and Germany who try to push this the racism but the beauty of it is that most of these people we see who will start the opposing of the Keshe foundation as these are the people who were born in Africa in the white skin.<br>还有一个帅小伙本杰明，曾经在戛纳政府里开发过太空署。戛纳和尼日利亚将会是非洲人性王冠上的明珠，很多的德国人都看不到这一点。很多生活在比利时和德国人都努力想消除种族主义，但是有趣的是，正是这些人开始反对凯史基金会而他们正是出生在非洲的白种人。<br>The same thing we saw the man in the 1940s 1930s who was a Jew born of a Jewish house kill more Jews to cover their own what they call origin. I had a declaration recently the ones who are damaging us most and ones who attempted to murder us with poisoning were both born in Congo and both raised in Belgium though they say not where they came from and used by those who understand how the abuse these people. From today we finish with them, they are gone and we show how we deal with this situation and we pray for them. We elevate their souls because that is only thing we can do. Let me tell you one thing going back on the structure of a lot of the people asking how, can we change things medically because we want to see the changes.<br>同样的事情发生在这个人（指希特勒）身上，他在二十世纪三十到四十年代，是一个出生在犹太家庭的犹太人，杀了很多的犹太人用来掩盖犹太人的身份，这种身份被许多人称为出身。在我最近发的一篇声明中我说过想要摧毁、试图毒害我们的人都是在刚果出生、在比利时长大的，尽管他们没有透露自己的国籍、被何人利用。从今天开始我们与这些人再无牵连，他们已经成为过去，我们表明了我们处理这种情况的方式，我们为他们祈祷。我们升华了他们的灵魂，这也是我们唯一能做的。我来告诉你们过去发生的一件事，很多人问，我们为医疗带来变革吗，因为我们希望看到变革。<br>I promised to the opening to French Keshe foundation last night that I will disclose something to the lot of you. The disclosure unfortunately we don’t have access to cameras because of the internet linkage but we repeat it in the next session next week. A lot of you have the problem or would like to see how you can change things, how you can bring things about in the way that you can support ill people. There is something I have to explain before I go to this and I spoke of this before, death is not the end it’s the beginning of a new cycle. When the man’s fear goes away from him that with closing his eyes to this physical world then will come and he will pay any money he is to make sure that he can stay alive to have more or more breath where he doesn’t understand that is more pleasure of existence on the other side when you finish with the physicality. Till you don’t understand this that there is no end you will suffer a lot.<br>昨晚我承诺将成立凯史法国分公司，今天我要向你们坦白一件事，很不幸没有相机来记录这次爆料，因为网络连接不畅，但是我们下次会再说一次。你们有很多人都很在意或想要看到你们可以改变世界，看到你们可以用你们的工作带来改变，帮助病人，在说这段话之前我想先向你们说明，之前我也说过，死亡并不是终结，而是新一轮的开始。当一个人闭上眼离开这个世界时，害怕也随之离开；而在现实中他愿意付出一切来获取多一些存活的机会，但是他不明白当你的躯体死亡到达另一个世界后会生活得更愉快，你不明白生命不止，痛苦永随的道理。</p>
<p>If you want to extend your life or living that is your decision but the whole object of existing in any dimension is to live at peace without what you call pain without suffering and part of the reduction suffering or at least limiting the pain is to understand the process of the plasma technology because your body is made up of plasma. This is what our job is.<br>如果你想延长你的生命，那是你的选择，但是在任何空间里人生存的目的就是没有痛苦的、和平地生存，减少痛苦，至少是消除一些疼痛的方法，这就是要理解等离子体技术的工作过程，因为你的身体就是由等离子体组成。这就是我们的工作。<br> Man one day will finish with the existence in the shape of the body of the man. Christ blessed  his name which is his birthday this week, did not last physically more than 30 odd years, so was the name of Pope both taken the same way. So was bless his name Mohammed, none of them have a state ,even though they were prophet of God physicality has no dimension, has no meaning in the world of creation, what you in essence create and live and what you allow others to live with counts.<br>人的躯体终有一天会死去。耶稣的生日，也就是在这一周，他的躯体也只存在了三十几年，蒲柏、穆罕默德也是如此，他们没有一个是永生的，即便是上帝的先知，物理身体或物理性没有多维度，在世界的创造中毫无意义，生命产生和存在的价值就在于为人造福。<br>A lot of you suffer from cancer, a lot of you suffer from different diseases, the new plasma technology has opened a lot of hope for a lot of people that they find a solution that they can exist longer, in the matter state of the physicality of this planet.<br>很多人经受癌症的折磨，遭受各种疾病的蹂躏， 新的等离子体技术会为你们带来福音，寻找治病良方，让你们的肉体在世上存活的更久一些。</p>
<p>Ask yourself one question if all our fore fathers could had lived was there any space on this planet left for us to live altogether at the moment. If all the seven billion at the moment and billions and billion before us stay on and be on existing ,what is going to happen to this planet.<br>你们好好想想，如果你们的先辈们依然在世，那么这个星球上还有多少空间可供你们一起生活。如果此前的几十上百亿的人口尚存于世，加上如今70亿人口，那么地球会变成什么样？<br>    We change positions accommodate a new life, we change in position to allow, to venture into a new dimension. So don’t look at the structure for survival to Keshe foundation in the plasma technology. If we give you the point of comfort we give you the condition of the comfort.<br>我们不断改变当前状况以适应新生活，去接纳、去探索新的领域或新的阶段。所以不要着眼于凯史基金会的等离子技术中的生存结构，如果我们给你指明安稳舒适的方法，就为你提供了舒适生活的条件。<br>You have to hold on one second ,can you carry on one second background until I can sort things out here. Vince? (Vince: Thank you. Mr.Keshe) You can show a video or discuss or whatever I’ll come back and we can go back on the screen.<br>请稍微等一下，我要去处理一些事情。文斯，（文斯：好的，谢谢您，凯史先生）你能给大家放个视频吗，或者其他什么，我很快就会回来，然后继续上课。<br>[Rick]: Okay, Is there any particular things anyone would like, any particular item anyone would like to bring up at this point to fill in at this moment? Maybe to recap anything from this year, any particular pictures or videos that stood out for folks that would like, to like to put up.<br>瑞：好的。大家有什么问题想要讨论来打发这段时间吗？或者总结一下今年的经历，可以和大家一起分享你的图片或视频。<br>[Robert]: Hi this is Robert from Utah<br>罗伯特：你好，我是来自美国犹他州的罗伯特。<br>[Rick]: Hi Robert how are you doing<br>瑞：你好，最近怎样？<br>[Robert]: I’m well how are you .<br>罗：挺好的，你呢？<br>[Rick]: Good<br>瑞：很好。<br>[Robert]: Good, I just wanted to say I just started nano coating on my stove actually and it’s working the best of anything that I’d done so far.It’s  very easy to heat as long as you watch it.<br>罗：好的。我想说我最近给家里的炉子涂上纳米涂层，之后它的性能达到有史以来之最。放进去的食物很快就能加热。<br>[Rick]: yes I have nano coated several of my cooking pots by accidentally allowing the contents to evaporate. it’s quite amazing, some of the coatings you get that high temperatures when stainless steel pan gets is red-hot for example in its got some sort of organic substance that ends up being just black charcoal at the end of it, such as jam works is really good and some mango that I did the other day and that it went dry and they burned really good so the sugars when they melt on the bottom of the pan as it heats up unattended, they first tend to melt and then the caramelized sort of a brown colour and then they turn black as things get hotter and evaporate and burn, and what is left on the bottom is essentially a nano coating, a carbon based nano coating would be very interesting to see the exact structure ,of course and the I know from experience it definitely becomes one with the pot and it’s so hard to get off.<br>瑞：我把厨房用的一些锅也涂上了纳米涂层，偶然间发现它还能把锅内的食物脱水蒸干。真的很奇妙，有些涂层会达到很高的温度，此时，不锈钢锅就会变成红色，里面的一些有机物质就会变成炭黑色，比如做成果酱就很好。有一天我把一些芒果放进去，它们先被蒸干，之后就烧得很美味；糖也是这样的。把它们加热就会融于锅底，开始会逐渐融化，之后变成焦糖色，再变成黑色，不断加热、变干，最后锅底就变成了含碳的纳米涂层，这样的结构真的很有趣，不过最后会发现，它与锅已经融为一体，很难刮掉。<br>I have the been trying some different things like vinegar and salt and letting it soak in the that kind of thing so basically it is a lot of scrubbing to get they to try to get that nano coating off of the pot. Of course we do have pots  from ancient times that have been essentially been nano coated to over fire, fire nano coating and i wonder sometimes about how it affects  even the outside of the pot all blocked from the coating, could be from several generations of ,over hundreds of years in some cases, have coatings on these cookware. Okay what else does anybody have any comments or questions opinions. Sorry can’t hear you there Mr Keshe<br>我尝试用其他东西，比如醋和盐，把它们浸在锅中，然后用力擦洗，努力想把锅内的那层含碳纳米涂层溶解掉。当然，有一些以前的锅已经在火上烤制形成纳米涂层，我有时在想，它是怎么阻断锅外的部分形成纳米涂层，可能是几代以前或是几百年前炊具上就有这种涂层。好了，其他人有没有什么观点或者意见。抱歉，凯史先生，现在听不到你讲话。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Oh is the audio bad?<br>凯史：我们的音频坏了吗？<br>[Rick]: No I have it, its back now<br>瑞：不是的，我现在在用它，好了，现在转到您那里了。<br>[Mr Keshe]: in the pictures you have, stacker of orange, who is this group? who are they?<br>凯：我看到图片上有一些橘色的栈式存储器，他们是哪个团队的，都是谁啊？<br>[Rick]: these red units here on the right side is the shenzhen group, it’s a Chinese group course and is the same group as you see on the left side here or in the centre there now. I haven’t heard too much from them other than i have the of those pictures is one of the picture and can bring up of the way they produce these units and shows them heating one of the coils.<br>瑞：屏幕右侧有红色装置的是深圳的团队制作的，这是支中国团队，就是屏幕左侧，现在我把它放到中间的这张图片上的这组团队也是中国的。他们给我发送了很多图片，我选取了其中一张，展示了他们制作这些装置，还有正在加热一个线圈。</p>
<p>[Mr Keshe]: It very beautiful the way they have done it, is which puts the metre in front of it with a metre.<br>凯：这个装置做的非常漂亮。他们是把仪表放在前面了还是在装置上？<br>[Rick]: the meter in front of it<br>瑞：放在前面。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I’ve seen one somewhere that they put a, what do you call it, like a metre you have in your home on wall from the government {sound problems}<br>凯：我曾经见到他们把政府装在墙上的电表放在…<br>[Rick]: Not sure. They do have show us some it shows in the pictures in the centre there the fellas holding a unit that seems to have some sort of meter.<br>瑞：我也不是很清楚。他们发给我的中间的这张图片，就是一个工作人员拿着一个装置可能就是这样的电表吧。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes I believe that was the Chinese group that did that, is that the one? I believe so. Maybe you can add to the knowledge if you follow the teachings of few weeks especially, that why By rotating the centre of these units you can that you should be able to shift position {sound problem}<br>Shows us the picture  of some pictures in the front with the 2 coils and {sound problems}<br>There are from Philippine we see one in front that looks to be the Chinese section with a torch.<br>凯：是的。我想这应该是中国团队做的，是吗？如果你能听接下来几周的课程，就会了解到更多相关的知识。通过这些单元装置中心的旋转运动，你就能改变位置。还有前面是两个线圈的图片。这些都是菲律宾产的，你们可以看到前面那个有一个火炬的应该是中国团队的。<br>[Rick] yeah that’s the Chinese<br>瑞：是的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:So it’s Shenzhen group. it’s okay. I have a surprise for you, maybe we announce it in time but we are hopefully due to be in china very soon. This I will inform very recently and explain in time due course. We will most probably see you in the centre in the coming time. So it will be nice to see but if you can go one step further and just put your gravitational coil in the centre in 90° with your magnetic coil. at this point you will reach and when you stacker three on top of each other and listen to what I taught last week, you should be able to create the elusive plasma you have been looking for and if you can position it in the right way ,three base and the centre the way I shown the drawing last week, you should be able to achieve the elusive lift.<br>凯:那应该是深圳团队。好。我有一个好消息要分享给大家，现在正是时候宣布，我们有望很快在中国开设分会。我很快就会发布通知，并向大家介绍这个项目，很快就能在中心见到你们。这样固然很好，但是如果你能再近一步，把中间的引力线圈与磁力线圈呈90度放置，直到你要到达的那个点。当你把这三个栈式存储器叠加放置，而且听了上周我讲的课程，按照那种方式做，你就能创建这种游离的独特的等离子体，如果你能把位置摆放正确，就像上周我讲的那样有三个基底、一个中心的结构，你就能实现这种上升（飞升）。<br>They are trying to fix my computer while I talk till we go back to full blast. Is ok now. You are increasing the speed okay. So what is, what will happen if you take the double coils and just rotate the gravitational coil 90° into respect to the magnetic, you should be able to create 3 stack and if you position them as you see yes in the picture you see now, have to make sure that the three coils sit at 90o in respect to the gravitational and magnetic and when you look from the top, all three are in line, then you’ll find a full, what they call, hexagonal shape structure that the three field forces of the three when you put in the star formation three bases, will give you the bottom of your  spaceship and then if you position this frame which you have above let’s say the fourth structure ,above the top of the top reactor which is(I don’t know if I can use option let me use one option ) you need to do this, you put the base of the fourth reactor above this line.<br>在我讲课的时候，他们正在修我的电脑，直到我们回到全屏操作这一部分。现在好了吗？好的，你们正在加快速度。那么，如果你有两个线圈，只把引力线圈旋转到与磁力线圈呈90度结构，接下来会发生什么呢？你应该能创建三层这样的结构，如果你能按照如图所示的方式放置，就必须要确保三个线圈的引力线圈和磁力线圈呈90度角放置。当你从上面观察时，会发现三个线圈在一条线上，然后就会发现一个全六角形结构，当你把它放入星球结构中的三个基底时，这三个存储器的三组磁场力会构建出宇宙飞船的底部，如果你构建出了这个结构，那就可以开始建第四个结构了，也就是位于反应器上方的上方，（我不知道能不能用这个选这个选项，让我试一下）你需要把第四个反应器的基座放到这条线的上面（这条线应该指的是三个引力线圈）</p>
<p>Can see the drawing Rick?<br>瑞克，你能看到我画的图像吗？<br>Rick: you can go into the color thing on line  您可以用带颜色的笔画线。<br>[Robert]: Can you change there Mr. Keshe it’s bit light<br>罗：凯史先生，你能换一下颜色吗？这个太亮了。<br>[Rick]: Yeah you can barely see it, the colour thing will thicken the line<br>瑞：你可能很难看清，这种颜色可以加深线条。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thanks very much, thanks for your help okay that’s perfect, thanks very much. I will try to do it here this is the line if you can’t see I will change the colour to blue. this is the blue this colour, your third system or the fourth system has to be the on this line, above this line ,so you keep three and then you allow the fourth one or the bottom base this one one wants to brace this won’t of your fourth one has to be at this level minimum, so what you create (I have to get out of this )can you remove this picture。 I am trying to get access to a drawing<br>凯：非常感谢，谢谢你的帮助。现在好多了。我会在这边画下来，这就是那条线，如果你看不清，那我就把它换成蓝色，嗯，这是蓝色。你的第三个或第四个系统 应该在这条线上，这条线的上面，这样你就有了三个存储器，接下来要把第四个存储器，或是直接把它的底部至少要放到这个层面上，那么你就创建了（我不想用这个了）能把这个移开吗，我在尝试画图。<br>[Rick]: sure yes let me just stop this share, you can do a screen share.<br>瑞：好的，我现在把这些图片关闭，您就能使用屏幕了。<br>[Mr Keshe] Okay what i am going to do is I going to go to screen share but I have to be able to use whiteboard. What you have to understand is this, you have your three stackers stacked up over each other the(I am not such a good drawer doesn’t matter) you make the other three stacker here, one and one here and then your fourth stacker should be level somewhere the height of these in the middle somewhere here. These 3 will give you the structure of  this side of your spaceship. is these three will give you the structure of this side of your spaceship, these 3 between this here and here will give you the front and in reality if you look, the 3 in the base here, they give you the shape of the floor. So what are you going to get, flat with this shape. 1:2:41<br>好的，我会想大家分享屏幕，但我首先要用白板。你们要知道，你要把这三个能量盒一个个叠加放置，（我画的不是很好，请不要介意）然后再建立另外三个能量盒，（如图）一个在右边，一个在稍上的位置，还有第四个应该放在中间，高出其他三个能量盒，看图上所画的右边两个和中间连在一起构成了太空船的右侧，左边的和中间相连构成太空船的左侧，位于前面的在同一条线上的两个与中间相连构成了太空船的正面，实际上，如果你看下面的三个能量盒相连，就构成了太空船的底部，你会得到底部平坦的飞船。<br> That’s why the colour and the structure of the spaceship is flat bottom and a big curvature on the top because these three at the bottom here are on the same horizontal level. This one on the top has created a field which is above this level pushes it up. As I said before to have a perfect system here you need to stack up 2 systems. 1, 3 separately and another three on the top this gives you the best. For the time till you understand how to stack up.<br>这就是为什么带颜色的线显示的就是底部平坦、顶部弯曲的太空船结构。因为下面的三个能量盒在同一水平线上，而上面的这个能量盒也创建了一个磁场，在红线显示的水平线之上，（绿线）从而使其飞升。像我说的，如果你想创建一个完美的系统，你必须要在图上画的地方叠加两个系统，其中一组能量盒分开与另一组分开，另一组3个线圈放在上面，这样便是最佳结构。这下你就应该明白如何叠加放置了。<br>So the structure (if I can go on camera let me see if I can share camera you have to remember 2 o’clock I am trying to how do I get to camera ) can you hear me yes? I am trying to do this sorted here in the background so I can use… 1:04:18<br>那么，这个结构（如果我可以用这个摄像机，来看看能不能分享，该怎么做呢，你们能听见吗？我看能不能后台能不能解决这个问题，那么我就可以用了）</p>
<p>[Robert]: I just started your video so you should just be able to click on it<br>罗：我刚开始听，请问您能点击一下吗？<br>[Mr.Keshe]: I can’t get rid my screen here (where do I go from here. I am on zone I think am on zoom, I am on screen a lot boxes on it<br>凯：我不能离开目前的屏幕，我要怎么做，我在这个有很多盒子的屏幕上。<br>[Robert]: Oh yes you should be at the top and go to full screen on that window<br>罗：是的，你应该在屏幕上方，应该打开全屏模式。<br>[Mr Keshe]; I got what I am trying to get the camera on the zoom.<br>凯：我正试图把镜头调焦。<br>[Robert]: now the bottom you should have the controls now correct<br>罗：在下方应该有一些控制按钮。现在对了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Wait one second I am on the zone now, it wants me to leave the meeting I don’t know why<br>凯：等一下，我现在在这了。系统提示让我退出，这是怎么回事？<br>[Robert]: Make sure you don’t click the x and you click the full screen and also make sure you’re in gallery view<br>罗：不要点对话框右上角的”X”，点击 全屏 按钮，<br>[Mr. Keshe] It says do you want to leave this meeting.<br>凯：它显示的是 你要退出吗？<br>[Robert]: NO Click NO<br>罗：不，点击 不。<br>[Mr Keshe]: I cancel it but it doesn’t allow me to, join a meeting? No, I am on used to these things<br>凯：我撤销了，但系统不允许，进入聊天室吗？不，我习惯于这些事情了。<br>[Robert]: I will click a start video button so window should pop up and you can just say click start my menu<br>罗：我会点击 开始 按钮，就会跳出对话框，然后您点击 开始菜单。<br>[Mr Keshe]: I just want the camera to come on, visit come on. This is a problem.<br>凯：我只是想让镜头对过来，快点过来啊，这还是有些问题。<br>[Robert]: yes you should’ve a window that pops up and says start my video click on start my video<br>罗：好的。您现在应该能看到弹出的对话框，上面显示 开始视频，点击开始菜单就可以了。<br>[Mr Keshe]: switching between the applications. that’s useless you gotta get out of it somehow, I don’t want this… How do I get out of this one guys?<br>凯：在两个设备间转换，这没有用啊，必须要离开，我不想要这样的，我怎么才能退出啊？<br>[Robert]: So on the bottom of the screen on the task bar you should have a zoom<br>罗：屏幕下方的任务栏中应该有一个调试的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I don’t have a taskbar it gone into get a sort of a window 8<br>凯：我这里没有任务栏啊。这应该是win8 系统。<br>[Robert]: That is definitely not where we want to be, so if you move your mouse all the way to the bottom I think the task bar should come up. Now you haver the zoom icon which is the blue and white icon<br>罗：这肯定不是我们要找的，您试试把鼠标一直向下拖动，到了最下面，任务栏应该就会出来。现在就有调焦按钮，就是那个蓝白相间的图标。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: {Mumbles} I don’t know how to get out of it.<br>凯：我不知道怎么做？<br>[Keshe]:This is what I want. This get opened up. okay,we are back on the window.<br>凯：对，这是我想要找的，好了，打开了。我们回到了这个窗口。<br>[Robert]:You can share the video. 您可以分享视频。<br>[Keshe]:No , I want start the video.can you see the pictures by any chance<br>凯:不，我现在要开始视频了。你们现在能看到图像吗？<br>[All]: We can<br>所有：可以。<br>[Mr Keshe]: {mumbles} What I’m trying to explain is this.you have you base reactors what we did at a star formation. what we need to do is to build (is this upside down this is the top) do you see the top or the bottom for this one<br>凯：我想要解释的就是这些。首先创建我们之前说的星球结构中的基础反应器。我们需要见的就是这些。（你们现在看的是颠倒的吗？笔画的这个应该在上面）你们看的这个应该是在上面还是在下面？<br>[Robert]: It is the bottom for us, you have to turn the camera around<br>罗：我们看到的是在下面。您需要把摄像头转一下。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Is this good?<br>凯：现在可以了吗？<br>[Robert]: getting much better is better it’s getting there<br>罗：好多了，接近了。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Is this better, we have to come out, we are too much, I don’t think it is looking that way it was upside down before. {mumbles} now its correct<br>凯：这样可以了吧？我需要出来一下，有些过了，我觉得好了<br>[Robert]: Yeah, a little blurry but pretty close the<br>罗：是的，有一点模糊，但现在已经好很多了。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Better now, yes we can see the squares. Okay sorry about this we are not in the usual position so step further as it is. So what we have what we create is this formation, and the three layers of the cyst formation will give us the bottom shape of the craft .here you need to stack up at least, if this is a centre of your system between the three base, the double stack up which starts at the top so what you get is this dome shape and this is what is important.<br>凯史：现在可以了。现在我们能看到那些方块了，很抱歉耽误了大家的时间，现在好了，让我们继续课程。我们现在创建的是图上的这个结构，三层这样的包囊状结构形成了飞船的底部结构，那么在笔指的地方，大概就是三个基底之间的中心位置，在这里至少要再向上堆两层能量盒，这样就能得到圆顶，这个结构非常重要。<br> Can we lift this up .I have a very small picture to work with, It has small box, so we can lift it up. So what we had and we have seen in simultaneously in 2, 3 different locations of testing, people who have made this structure with the power system, the margrave power systems with the central coil, they have achieved to see the elusive blue plasma. When you put your systems in this coordinate and you see the , as some of you have seen and you see the shimmer of the blue, it’s not a white clear room where you are or the  spaces you are testing in a garage, as some of you know what I am talking about and those of you who are testing in a fear of, if it flies off ,you are not going to go through the ceiling, you’re testing this in the garden you will see this blue shimmer and then silverish light.<br>我们能把摄像头举高一下吗?不然，只有很小的空间可供我画图。这有个小盒子，我们可以动一下。那么接下来，我们可以同时在两三处不同的测试点都看到这个带有中心线圈的太空船结构磁引力能量系统中出现蓝色游离的等离子体（画了一些蓝色波浪线）。有些人已经观察到如果把整个系统放到这个坐标中，你们就会看到蓝色微光，测试地点不要在明亮的房间或在车库，有人能理解我为什么这样说，你们有人做实验时担心这些等离子体会飞出去，你们又不能仔细检查天花板。如果在花园里测试，你们就能看到蓝色微光和银色光线。<br>When you see this why you can’t see the boundaries of your what are called, the craft, is because these units need adjusting. these units, the position of the inner coil or what we call the gravitational coil needs adjusting. Your magnetic coil has already radiated out, it’s your gravitational which has to bring the fields together at the boundary that it creates the physical structure what they call the whole matter state.<br>当你看到这些的时候，为什么你不能看到飞船的边界呢？因为图中的这三个基底的位置需要调整，内核心线圈也就是我们所说的引力线圈的位置需要调整，磁力线圈的场强度已经向外辐射，那么引力线圈的场强度也应向边界靠拢（向下的箭头表示引力场强），这样就构成了这种状态下的物理结构。<br>Then you will see a physical craft, and some of you are days away from this at least 2 of you are days away from this. I was teaching somebody who is very close, a couple days ago, how to solidify the structure. You need to adjust your three reactors in a very specific way that they look and they stand like this.So one creates the magnetic fields and the other one creates sorry one creates the gravitational field and the other one creates the magnetic field and the interaction of these 3 will give you the elusive craft.<br>也就是飞船的物理结构(画了一个粗线圈）。你们有些人可能好几天都没有做这方面的工作，至少其中两个人是这样的，几天前，我还在教一个熟人怎样稳固这个结构。你们必须用一种特殊的方式调整这三个反应器，像我画的这样，（画了3个黄色纵向的粗线）反应器中横向的线圈创造的是引力磁场，纵向的则是磁力磁场，（黑色代表引力磁场，纵向黄色代表磁力磁场）三个这种结构的反应器的相互作用则构成了这种游离状态的独特的飞船架构。<br>Two of you are on the verge to achieving it. One of you has not managed to bring the fields together properly but as we know and we recorded you are shaping and you see the blue plasma condition. The blue plasma you see in the environment you are testing is a interaction of your plasma with a nitrogen available in the room.<br>你们中有两个人已经很接近这一步了。其中一个人并未能把这些磁场连接到一起（画了黄色波浪），但据我们所知，在你创建这一结构的时候，你会看到发出蓝色微光的等离子体，而这就是实验房间中参与反应的氮和等离子体相互作用的结果。<br>Is for you to bring, and just it needs very little adjustments. Very little adjustments will create the elusive boundary and I have told you to all of who are in that position ,you’ll find yourself inside your own craft. You’re the man standing and watching. If you don’t feel in a position of confidence, all need to do is just to move one of these units sideways,  disturb the fields .<br>这一个过程需要你来完成，仅需稍加调整，就能创建这种游离的独特的边界。我对所有处于这种环境中的人说过，你会发现自己置身于建构的飞船中，你站在里面观察（画了一个小人），如果你觉得对当前的情况没有把握，那就把其中一个反应器向边上移动，干扰（调整）这些磁场。<br>do not play with the plasma strength, because if you do not know what you’re doing, you could be lifting the landing or descending or being half blocked. I always teach you when you reach a point of breakthrough and you are a number of you, on the verge of break breakthrough and I know more people are testing, buildings the coils as fast as they can.<br>不要随意玩弄等离子体强度，因为如果你不知道自己在干什么，你可能会飞起来或着陆或下降或停在中途。我一直在强调，当你们到了突破点，或是即将到达这个突破点，我知道很多人都在实验，在尽快建构这些线圈，<br>You need minimum five sets of coil of three, you can do with five single coils as well. If you have five coils, you built five coils, you should be able to achieve the same kind of results but in a very soft way, as I said and I teach all the three people now, the same way is when you have your base coil and you have your top coil, this is a repetition of what we taught last week but it seems that some of the you did not understand it. You connect your magnetic and gravitational to each other and you make sure that your gravitational connects in the right order to the magnetic or gravitational as you choose.<br>那你需要至少放置在五个位置的三层结构的反应器，也可以用5个单独的线圈。如果你有五个线圈的话，在建构的时候，一定要注意最终能产生同样的效果，按照我目前教的三个人那样，要以一种温和的方式，也就是先构建底层线圈，再是上层线圈，就像这样循环往复，这也是我上周课程重复所讲的，但是可能有些人不是很理解这种方式。将每组线圈的磁引力场相连，同时确保引力线圈按照正确的顺序与你选择的磁力线圈或引力线圈相连。<br>Remember what I used to warn very specifically, make your system flexible enough that you can add the magnetic of the top to the gravitational of the bottom or you can make the magnetic of the top to the magnetic of the bottom to each one of them separately<br> This way if you understand you dictate the next step, the direction of your motion, you add directly from the top to magnetic or to gravitational or you feed directly to the gravitational that you dissent. But in that position you never lose the structure of the craft (Can you find a way to up, it’s too narrow for me to work) so in so many ways why not that a lot of you are in position to move on,  you are in a position to create all field forces directly into the centre.<br>一定要记住我之前特别强调的，你建造的这个系统必须灵活，这样你就可以把顶部能量盒的磁力线圈与基底能量盒的引力线圈（引力场）分别连接（黑线画粗）或与基底的磁力线圈分别连接（画了三条黑线与底座三个反应器相连）。如果你能弄清楚这种连接方式，那么你就可以操控下一步，也就是系统等离子运动的方向（画了一个箭头），你直接让中心顶部的磁力线圈与基底的磁力线圈或引力线圈相互连接或是你自己不同意这种方式的话，就直接从引力线圈提供能量。但是，即使在这种情况下，也要保持飞船的架构。（能不能把摄像头向上移一下，这个空间太小了，我没法画图的）在很大程度上，为什么很多人在这种情况下都不继续，因为你们所处的情况是你们创建的磁场力都指向中心（画了三个黑圈，表示4个磁引力场）。</p>
<p>Some of you are testing a new dimension, which some of you have brought your single coil rotating coils the coils you made few months ago and you are placing it in the centre of your stacker unit. Be careful how you put it on where you position it. (You going to pull up, yap that is better) So what you’ll see if you increase the magnetic to magnetic ,you increase gravitational to gravitational or magnetic to gravitational, you increase the power of decent or ascend.<br>有些人正在尝试一种新维度的单元，把单个旋转的线圈也就是你数月前做的线圈放到能量盒装置的中心（在盒子里画了三个蓝色的圈），注意你要怎么放置它以及放在具体什么位置。（你要把镜头向上移动吗。这样就好多了），那么接下来你会发现，如果你加强了顶部磁力与底部磁力的连接（又从上往下画这条粗线），增强引力与引力的连接（从上往下画了一条黄线）或是磁力到引力的连接，你就增加了飞船上升或下降的能量。（画了一个黄箭头）<br>Be aware that any plasma you achieve in this, is totally harmless to your body. because of a number of reasons. First of all ,you created the plasma out of the matter state of this planet and your body is in the matter state of the gans of this planet. So there is no harm. any kind of field which is released in this system is what you naturally are used to in the atmosphere you are breathing in. Your body only takes from this  environment what it needs, I have explained to the people who are building these systems which are not using any further what are called electric vibration （of electron current.<br>你要知道这整个飞船结构中的等离子体（蓝色线条）对你的身体没有任何伤害，有很多因素。首先，等离子体脱离于地球的物质形态，而人体则是地球环境下的甘斯态，所以就不会有伤害，整个系统中释放的磁场和人体所处的地球生活环境并无异样，你的身体只会从环境中获取所需要的物质（画了一些蓝色横线），我曾给正在建立这个系统的人解释过，这个系统不会用到我们所知的电流的电子振动。<br>If you develop the battery unit the way we taught in the past teachings, for each system independently ,you use everything in the plasma state. So you don’t have the electoral vibration which can damage physical body. The reason you see you radiation damage through x-rays, gamma rays is because it’s created out of the matter state. If you create x-rays, gamma rays or whatever radiation in the plasma state your body only takes it if he needs it, you cannot create damage because your body takes what is needs.<br>如果你为每个反应器建立个相互独立的电池单元（画了四个实心的蓝色方块，表示电池），那么你就使用了等离子体状态下的所有东西（让等离子体释放其全部效应）。你就不会使用伤害人体的电子振动装置，人体之所以会遭受的X射线和伽马射线的辐射伤害，是因为它产生于物质形态，如果你在等离子环境下创造X射线和伽马射线或任何放射性物质，你的身体也只会吸收所需的物质，这不会产生任何危害，因为你的身体只获取其所需。<br>To the same effect, this is what up in teaching the support groups and the people we will work with in the background, when you make your a split batteries or split capacitors, you have a central system in the middle and you have put some gans material and then you have put some paper and then you have put let’s say aluminium to wrap and you inserted it in this coil which is the outer coil till it comes to itself.   1:24:00<br>为取得同样的效果，也就是我们在课堂上提出的，所有的后援团队和工作人员都会在后台进行实验。当你创建一个分离电池或是分离电容器时，你会在中间创造一个中心系统，然后放置一些甘斯物质和纸，再用铝包裹（两条黄线），之后把它放入外层线圈中，直至形成最终结构。<br>Take one coil and put it on to load ,to go to your stacker unit here and take another load another string and load it back into the base of your capacitor. If you don’t use aluminium or you just use a plain aluminium or anything else, you create a capacitor composite battery system.<br>再用一条线，把它向上卷，连接到能量盒装置中（连接到笔所指），然后把另一条线向下缠绕（向下画了一条线）到电容器的底部，如果你不用铝或只是用普通的铝或其他东西，那么你制造的就是电容器复合电池系统。<br>What I called last week we do that you create a couple weeks ago about the split capacitors. You can add a nano coated aluminium or titanium as the wrapping around this centre nano coated material, make sure this film is nano coated .if you nano coat this material which now if you go like to the Alex system which he uses aluminium foil, nano coat the aluminium foil, take the paper out of the equation, you can still keep the paper in because paper from the material which is made is already in the gans state of weakness, then when you put your, what I call ,gans in between as you load and your coils are nano coated already, this  structure will work totally in the plasma condition, you have no more matter state.<br>而我们上周所说的几周前做的分离电容器，可以用纳米涂层的铝或钛包裹中心位置的纳米涂层材料，你要确保这个薄膜也就是我的笔画的这个地方有纳米涂层，如果该物质上有纳米涂层，也就是目前这个结构与艾利克斯用纳米涂层的铝箔创建的结构相似，那么现在就可以把纸从反应式（反应系统）中拿出，你也可以继续保留，因为这种物质中的纸在制作时所含的甘斯很少，当你把甘斯置于其间（画了黄色的波浪表示甘斯），作为你的负荷，并且线圈都有了纳米涂层，而这整个结构就会完全在等离子体的状态下运行，再没有任何物质状态。<br>Even though your aluminium foil created a a condition for containment of a gans itself ,now the matter state here is not the matter anymore, it works totally in the plasma state, so for the first time now that we reaching a position of lift, you have to learn how to make a real plasma condition battery or energy source.<br>即使铝箔中包含有一定容量的甘斯，但此时的物质状态已不是我们理解的物质，它已完全在等离子体的状态下运行，这也是我们首次达到飞升的位置。你要知道怎么制造真正的等离子体电池或等离子能源。<br>You had the centre beam nano coated (I wish I could use the board) in the centre so this is nano coated the way we have. You added the gans on it then you added the nano coated ,let’s say aluminium or titanium, and then you have put your what are called (I don’t have another colour here) you have put your coils on it, this is your coils which is over it and then you have put on another coil which is feeding back to the base or off the system or the battery. This is the first time you see a full plasmatic battery condition. This is playing both the capacitor and the battery, the storage.<br>先做一个纳米涂层的中心横梁（我希望我能用白板）就像这样带有纳米涂层，放入甘斯（旁边黄点表示甘斯），然后是有纳米涂层的铝或钛，再把一个线圈在这个装置外向上缠绕（画了黄色的缠绕的线），（抱歉，我没有其他颜色的记号笔）再用一个线圈向下缠绕回到或稍微超出系统或电池的底部。这就是完全等离子状态下的电池。它既有电容器的功效也有电池的功效，存储功能。<br>The capacitance will come from this end and the battery part, battery energy part will come from this end. The only difference is, up to now ,you use non-nano coated ,now you nano coat your aluminium foil or whatever you used to coat it .because this is nano in the plasma condition nano coated ,you have a gans you have a nano material and 2 different structure, you have to make sure this film here which you wrap is not the same as the one you use, that you have a difference in the strength.<br> 电容来自于下半部分，而电池能量部分出自上半部分。目前为止，唯一的不同点就在于使用非纳米涂层材料和使用带有纳米涂层的铝箔，或是其它涂层的材料，因为这是等离子体环境下的纳米涂层，这个装置中有甘斯、有纳米材料还有两个不同的结构，你也要保证这层用来包裹的薄膜上面所用的材料（笔所指，外面的包裹）不是一样的，这样才会有不同的磁场强度。<br>So you have a split capacitor battery energy source and is this kind of system which you have to use to energize your stacker units for the space technology. In the coming time then you have to teach yourself how to control the energy output from here and the energy output control here the best way to be done is as following.<br>这样一来，便建立了一个分离电容能量电池，就是用这个系统装置为空间技术中的能量盒提供能量。接下来，你要摸索怎样控制能量输出（箭头表示能量输出）和怎样使用能量输出控制器（笔所指）。最佳方法就像接下来的这样：<br> I call this this units let’s say A .what you need to do is to continuity and stability of the energy, continuity and stability of ,what we call , plasma strength difference and then continuity of the flow of the plasma.. So you have to do such a structure. Recall a frame with 4 As in it, you put 4 of  these structures in a parallel condition in one frame. Then you make these in series if I am to call this structure B.<br>我把这整个装置称之为A系统。你需要做的就是保证能量的持续性和稳定性，也就是不同等离子体强度的持续性和稳定性，以及等离子流的持续性。你就必须要建立这样一个系统：一个有4个A系统的架构，每个系统都要平行放置，然这种系列的结构就是B系统。<br>You put three Bs ,minimum three Bs in series this power system as a normal power supply. This process will give you a lot of benefits and flexibilities what does this mean is that here you guarantee the potential difference and here you add the current of the plasma flow increases and increases. So you can dictate in your process if you want to have a weaker current you disconnect from here to here if you want a stronger you connect here I you want very strong you connect from here to here. 1:31:12<br>你要至少建立3个B系统，在能量系统中形成一个系列，这就是基础的能量供应系统。这样的装置能给你带来一系列的好处和灵活性，这就意味着，一个独立的B系统的上方保证了潜在的不同，系统底部的等离子流不断增加，这样你就可以控制整个过程，如果你想要弱一点的等离子流，就可以把前两个系统断连，如果想要更强一点，就可以把第二个和下面的等离子流连接，如果更强一点的就把第三个系统与上面的相连。</p>
<p>But as we are going through this process you have to remember another thing, in this structure if you remember we said you put the gans as you always do you put the gans on the tissue now you put the gans  between the nano layer and the nano layer. If I am playing a very straightforward game and that is when you have the central beam and then you put the gans or you put your paper here to cover the gans and then you have still the gans going through the paper itself anyway then you have your what I call the nano coated wrapper which creates a condition of separation and storage  don’t forget when you look at this from the top you have this you have the centre then you have the gans and then you have your nano coated film. And don’t forget this because you rolled it inside and then on top of it you put the coil of your nano coated coil which comes up or another one which goes down.<br>但在运行这个进程的时候，你们要记住一点，如果你们还记得之前所说的，也是大家一直都在做的，在这一结构中把甘斯放入组织中（深黄色线），现在你把甘斯放在两个纳米层之间，就像在做一个非常简单的游戏，首先要有中心横梁，然后把甘斯或者纸放在这里包住甘斯，这样甘斯还是可以穿透纸。那么你就有了我所说的纳米涂层包装，它可以为分离和储存创造条件。当你从顶上往下看，能看到有中心，然后是甘斯，还有纳米涂层膜。不要忘了，因为你把它卷在里面，然后在这外面，放上纳米涂层线圈，一个向上缠绕，一个向下缠绕。<br> Now before, at this stage when you are putting the gans in between now you can play a very straight forward move, which is to take this gans which are placing here and make it of the composite of let’s say: zinc， CH3 ,apple essence orange meat and everything else you want so you can make one of each four of these cells, one for vegetable, 1 for meat one for whatever you need and when you connect your system to your margrave stack which is here placed here. This if you call now this structure C then this is your structure C here. These are all structure Cs don’t forget the energy from your power supply battery plasmas now are powering your what you call the crystalline structure margrave systems or your coil systems, so what happens energy of Orange will flow through your reactor, the energy meat will flow to your reactor because you decide this is stacker C will have amino acid or whatever in it and as you remember in all our teachings in the past and what we saw with others and you to see for yourself.</p>
<p>在此之前，在这个阶段你会把甘斯放在中间，现在可以直接把放在此处的甘斯（蓝色圈），用它制作复合材料（混合物）：锌，CH3，苹果香精，橙子，肉或任何物质，那么你可以制作这四个电池单元中的任何一个，一个用在蔬菜上，一个用在肉上，其他的就可以用于你所需要的东西上。当你把系统（笔所指）和这里的磁引力堆联系在一起时，如果你现在把我画的这个结构叫做C，这就是结构C，这些都是（写了4个C）。别忘了等离子电池的能量（笔所指）正在推动水晶结构磁引力系统或线圈系统运行，所以橙子（橘子)能量将流经你的反应器，肉的能量会流向（右边黄箭头）你的反应器，因为你引导能量盒C产生了氨基酸。不管里面是什么，只要你还记得我们学过的内容，记得别人做实验时我们一起看到的，在你做实验时也要这样。<br>When you have the cup and you put an orange you made the gans of the orange the energy of the gans of the orange was transmitted and you tasted the Orange or the banana or whatever. So because the field transfer, now you understand the structure how you feed yourself with the space. This energy of orange or Vitamin C will last for centuries. Man will not go hungry in space. The reality is that if you brought everything together, I can tell you we have made gans of abberbofane, we have made ganses of lemon, we made the ganses of tea, and we have made ganses of aspirin.<br>如果你有个杯子，你放上橘子，你制作出橘子的甘斯能量，橘子的甘斯能量（画了两条竖线）被传输，你就像已经尝到橘子、香蕉或其他水果的味道。这就是场体转移（画了三角箭头）。现在你应该可以理解这个架构（笔所指）如何能在太空中生存。橘子（笔所指）或者说维生素C的能量将持续几个世纪，人类在太空中就不会挨饿。现实的情况是，如果把一切融合在一起，可以说我们已经取得了咖啡的甘斯，取得了柠檬甘斯，茶甘斯，也已经取得了阿司匹林的甘斯。<br>When you add this gans or the ganses of your liking inthese you dictate, if you have a let’s say pain inflammation you don’t need to take the anti-inflammatory you will have built the gans of Ibuprofen here and in the further teachings as it comes, if you can measure the strength of the Ibuprofen for example which gives anti-inflammatory you don’t need to put that there you can release the energy of that according in the combination of how you set your power supplies. So in the interaction with power supply now you have become totally independent of food source medicine source in your space troubles because don’t forget Ibuprofen  has the specific strength which within the body of the man operates to the both field energies. You already have the plasmatic hybrofin you call it the pen pants.<br>当你添加这些甘斯或最近比较喜欢的甘斯在这里（手所指）时，如果你出现疼痛发炎的症状，无需消炎，只需要建立布洛芬（药名，退烧药）甘斯，在接下来的课程中，如果你会了解布洛芬的磁引力场强度，就可以消炎，你可以不把它放在这里（手所指），你可以根据供电的原理（上面的括号）来释放它的能量。所以在供电的作用下，现在你已经完全独立，不需要受你现在空间内食物来源，药品来源的困扰。要记得布洛芬在人体内（画了一个人）具有的特殊能量场能够在两个能量场之间运行。你已经有了等离子体态的布洛芬，也就是你们所说的笔裤。</p>
<p>So if you understand that measure this measure allows him to get rid of the pain of cancer<br>or is this measure allows him to get calm of burn immediately you can adjust so this way you become independent of any matter stated now that you can measure the strength of it. This is what I told you I’ll teach you everything that those of you who understand are ready to take off in the right way but when you take off you have to understand the control, you have to understand how to feed yourself and how you can increase it, how you can put a number of Bs next to each other or a number of Cs indifferent combination will give you the strength you want. There is no excuse for man to be on this planet and suffering the way he does from now on.<br>因此，如果你能弄明白这个方法，它能让人摆脱癌症的痛苦，或者能立即让人由焦灼痛苦恢复平静，如果你能理解其中的力量，就可以稍加调整，这样你就能独立于任何物质形态，现在你就可以测量其强度。这就是我要告诉你们的，我会教你们一切。能够理解我的人准备以正确方式开始这项工作，但是当你准备出发（飞升）时，你必须理解控制的含义，你必须了解如何（利用等离子体供给你能量）存活，如何提升它(增加场强），如何使很多B结构彼此相邻或用很多结构C保持中性组合，理解这些你会得到你想要的力量（给你需要的强度）。在这颗星球上，从现在开始，没有任何理由让人在自己的路上（所做的事情中）受苦。<br>We are none to blame, we come across a process of teaching and learning over centuries and  now we have reached the pinnacle of science. You understand the work of the universe the way it is not the way we wanted to do in the matter state. If you start putting these together understanding this I have given you or less a full spectrum of living without a state of matter but using the state of matter to create the environment of the plasma, which one leads to the other and one brings into the other point. This is the secret of creation this is the message of understanding the knowledge of the universe and is for you all to do with how you want to achieve it. Like I said we have to make the power units we have to make the pen units. While some of you in the coming weeks will be passenger of space without the shadow of a doubt.<br>我们不应当受到责备，经历了跨越世纪的教课和学习过程，我们现在已经到达科学的顶峰。你理解宇宙的运行方式，这不同于我们在物质状态做事情的方式。如果你要把这些整合在一起，去理解我给你的信息，或者在更少的没有物质状态的全频谱中，但是可以通过物质状态创造等离子体环境，由一点引出另一点，一点带动另一个点，这就是创造的秘密，是对信息的理解，是宇宙的学问。对于你们所有人来说，最重要的是如何去实现它。之前提过，我们必须建立能量单元，建立医疗笔单元，而你们中的一些人在未来几周内将会抛弃疑虑，在太空中旅游。<br> I salute you souls  I hope you find peace in space. Understand once you achieve by accident or true control  to achieve to position yourself beyond the boundary of this planet   is the ethos of peace. There is no reason for any of you who have listened to all teachings understood the process to be shackled down with hunger and motion with energy or position on this planet. You have the whole process you always looked at the copper or iron but none of you stood still to understand this these are the beauty of being on this planet where in the space we have to wait for billions of years for the fields to come together to create the environment and the condition that the second conditional plasma to come together to call it a star or planet, or whatever on this planet because of what you been taught in the past couple of months in the past couple of years through the development of the nano material of the structure and the gans of the same structure.<br>我向你们的灵魂致敬，希望你们在太空中找到和平。一旦你能够突然理解或达到真正的控制，能将自己定位在这个星球边界之外（摆脱这个星球的边界束缚），这就是和平的精神。你们已经听过所有的课程，没有理由认为饥饿，运动，能量或这个星球位置能够束缚这个进程发展。整个过程你总是看着铜或铁，但是你们都不能理解这个星球的美丽。在太空中，我们必须等待数十亿年时间，（磁）场才能相互结合在一起创造一个环境，然后在其中的等离子体才能相互作用创造一个星球。而运用你在过去的几个月里，在过去的几年里学到的内容，通过纳米材料技术的发展与同样的结构的甘斯，你也能做到。<br>Now you don’t need to wait billions of years now you dictate the condition of the creation. This is what we set the completion of the promise of God. Now is in your hand with the beauty that you can turn it change it according to what you want you don’t need for billions of years to wait  for fields and condition to be created. You use the solidity of the matter state to create the condition which you want in the plasma state and you have the total freedom. We will lose some of you in the coming weeks and months through testing but not knowing what mistakes and it’s been the same go back to white brothers go back to the first test of cancer technology, go back to the first even donkey, people who try to get on the donkey the first time even the horses they fell off and they killed themselves or they broke something   we are in the same process. You have  if you understand  I have given you the boat of Noah   it’s you who has to decide how he is going to utilize.<br>现在你不用等待数十亿年，现在你就可以创造条件，实现上帝的福祉。现在这份美丽就在你手中，你可以根据想象转化它改变它，不用花数十亿年等着条件被创造出来。通过利用物质状态的稳定性，去创造你想要的等离子体状态，实现完全的自由。通过测试，我们可能会在未来几周和几个月的实验中失去一些人，不知道什么错误，但都一样，回到白人兄弟身边，回顾第一次测试的癌症技术，回顾骑第一个驴，人们试图第一次骑驴甚至马，他们摔下来摔死了，没摔死就打破了常规。我们在相同的过程中。如果你明白我已赠给你“诺亚方舟”，你必须决定如何利用它。<br>There is no government who can stop you and there is no one who can block you from achieving to become man of space, excerpt don’t forget it’s you who changes the ethos by your thoughts.  I was going to a video with Vince from where tests yesterday of past weeks and he got it straight away he said when we don’t see the hand it is the intention you see what’s happening about that head and when people start walking the intention of these forces he has understood fully. If your intention is correct  you create a different feel of environment you become a gans part of the structure. So if you create the wrong field release you create a different environment and that environment will not be what you want and you will find your own device.  So you are in charge of the condition not the condition in charge of you.<br>没有政府能阻止你，没有人可以阻止你成为太空人，别忘了只有你可以改变自己。我昨天在过去几周去文斯录制视频并测试的地点，他毫不犹豫地说当我们看不见手时，是意识让你看清头脑中发生的事情，当人们开始遵循这些力量的意向，他们就可以充分理解。如果你的意向是正确的，你将创造对一个环境的不同感觉，你将成为该结构的甘斯部分。如果你创建了错误的磁场，你就创造了一个不同的环境，而这个环境也不是你想要的，你会找到属于自己的装置，那么也就是你掌管条件，而不是条件控制你。<br> I will be seeing it hopefully when we are do this in more detail and our team , Rick and Vince and others who record these things they are in different groups as you bring them in of you will see it how you have a structure and instantaneously the structure is not there because the intention has changed. From today is the last day of 2015 in Christian calendar, and tomorrow the beginning and you have are beginning to start with. Get wires out off the walls makes your coils single coil it still gives you the same if you make the battery for it correct you don’t need to connect it to the power of the wall . Make a 3 stacker that it gives you the condition of creation of a sunteer of the fields which what we call tangibility and your all man of space every single one of you.<br>我希望我们能关注更多细节，我们的团队，里克、文斯和其他人记录这些信息，他们在不同的组，当把他们聚在一起，你会看到你如何构建一个结构，并且结构因为意向改变而突然改变位置。今天是阳历2015的最后一天，明天是新的开始，你已经在开始的路上。把电线从墙壁上取下，制作你的线圈，单线圈，如果制成的电池正确，它们的效果是相同的，你不需要把它和墙上的电路连接。做一个能量盒，它给一个条件，在这个条件创造出一个（磁）场领域，我们称之为有形性。你们每个人都会成为太空人。<br>There are people listening from every corner of this planet no knowledge has been disbursed so beautifully be so balanced across from the planet ever, maybe in the universe and all of you  doesn’t matter where you don’t like to be in Africa  build the system understand  the position about the electrical magnetic field of Moscow, Washington, Beijing anywhere   you will be there within seconds protected. None of you need to trained astronauts   there is no word astronaut we call the motions. Man originated magnetic gravitational field system we travel out of this planet one day not montage of days. There is no astronaut there is no cosmonaut they don’t know you, you come from the blue planet   I am a human now is in your hand. I have taught you everything you need to know but don’t get fooled by the matters we used to achieve what you achieve  in plasma,   double the tools and the beauty of the matter state it  is that you can create the environment and control it. you have the full potential of achieving everything in the universe   there is no need and there is no reason for man not to achieve it.<br>人们倾听这个星球的每一个角落，没有知识能以如此美妙，如此平衡的方式在这个星球上传播，也许在宇宙中也是如此。你们所有人，如果你不想在非洲建立系统，了解关于莫斯科、华盛顿、北京或任何地方电磁场的位置，你能用几秒钟的时间安全到达那里。你们无需被训练成宇航员。我们称之为运动而非宇航员。建立在磁场引力场系统上的人，我们在这个星球上出来旅行只要一天。没有航天员，没有宇航员，他们不认识你，你来自蓝色星球。我是一个人，现在就掌握在你的手中。我教过所有你需要知道的东西，但不要被那些我们以前在等离子体中实现的所愚弄，物质工具与物质状态结合在一起的美好之处美妙在于你可以创造和控制环境，你有充分的潜力创造宇宙中的万物，我们有必要有理由去实现它。<br>What you have and I explained before with your coils which is double twisted inside each other  you have created all the gravitational and the magnetic field not only internally but  externally too. So where ever you are the way I taught you to make the coil double coil  inside you have continuous equal gravitational magnetic field and if you put CO2 on it and you put zinc on it you have connected the emotion of the man to it on a stable condition  and you will find out and you will become a very peaceful man  and if you mix your ganses the right way  and even on different levels on different coils  and different cores  you will find out you have the spectrum of whatever man needs on this planet in the space that you will feel comfortable that you don’t create new wars in space. Any questions?<br>我之前用一对相互缠绕的相嵌入的线圈解释过，你创造了内部的外部的所有磁引力场（磁力与引力）（黄色表示磁引力场）。（外面圈表示外部的磁引力场）所以不管你在何处，如果按照我教你的方法做双线圈（画外面的黄色线圈，表示双线圈），你会获得连续相等的磁引力场（在里面画点），如果你放入二氧化碳（在内圈涂黄色）和锌（在外圈涂黄色），你以一个稳定的状态将人的情感与之连接，你会发现，你会成为一个很安静的人，如果你的甘斯混合途径正确，甚至在不同的层次上，不同的线圈和不同的核心上，你会发现你有这个星球上所有人需要的全部波谱，你会感到舒适，你不会创造新的太空大战。大家有什么问题吗？<br>[Rick]: Thank you Mr Keshe, go ahead sorry<br>[Rick]: 谢谢凯史先生，不好意思，您请继续。<br>[Person1]: I was going to ask if describe a way to make hydrogen gans you be spoken about or is something we have to find on our own<br>我想问您是否能描述一个方法获得您说的氢甘斯，或是需要我们自己找到。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Why do you need hydrogen gans?<br>你为什么需要氢甘斯呢？<br>[Person1]: I read on one of the websites where you were talking from the Keshe foundation when you were saying that we would need hydrogen gans in order to travel the universe, if I remember correctly it’s because hydrogen is       in the entirety of the universe. It was on the Keshe website though<br>我阅读的一个网站，你正在凯史基金会讲话时，你说为了太空旅行我们需要氢甘斯，如果我没记错的话，这是因为氢充满了整个宇宙。这是从凯史网站看到的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: In the structure which you have done you already carry it and that’s the minimum common denominator.<br>在你已经完成的结构中，你已经传递了氢甘斯，这是最小的共同点(传输氢甘斯是自然地）。<br>[Person1]: Okay great, Thank you very much<br>[Person1]:好的，非常感谢。<br>[Mr Keshe]: You understand when make the CH3 when you make the CONH when you have the interaction of any element   the minimum release as a plasma is the hydrogen  and that’s why hydrogen is the essence of the creation of the space you need it, but this way the way we went the development of the gans you already carry it  and this is the essence of the energy most of the energy which you  release in the field the strength will come through hydrogen of the structure. You will understand in the coming time.<br>要明白制作CH3，制作CONH 酰胺键，当任何元素互相反应，作为等离子体释放的最小单位就是氢，这就是为什么氢是你所需要的空间创造的要素。在这个产生甘斯的方式中已经携带了氢，这也是你释放能量的要素，你在空间中释放的大部分能量会通过结构中的氢的场强。你们以后会慢慢理解。<br>[Person]: Okay thank you very much I appreciate it I was using carbon to char to get down to as far as I could but I will stop doing that now thank you<br>[Person]:好的，非常感谢。我原来是用碳元素着手处理的，现在要停止这种做法，谢谢您。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You already have it, with the gans of CH3 even if you make the gans of water you already have it a lot of you have made gans of water but you’re not realizing it how. Any other question?<br>你已经拥有了它，有了CH3的甘斯。即使你要制出水甘斯，你已经拥有了很多，你已经获得了水甘斯但你没有意识到。还有其他问题吗？<br>[Rick]: Just wondering if anyone else has a question, there is a viewer here that has the hand up Libby and I will let them ask a question here, just as the second, maybe you can open your microphone if you like.<br>[Rick]: 只是想知道如果任何人有问题吗？在这里有一个观众，利比举手了，我会让他在这里问一个问题，等一下，如果你准备好了，你就打开你的麦克风。<br>[Libby]: Sorry Mr. Keshe I have pushed the wrong buttons.<br>[Libby]:对不起，凯史先生，我按错了按钮。<br>[Rick]: okay see there’s other questions here, Tim asks how much gans do you use on the capacitor battery, how thick should the gans be ?You mentioned rolling up the aluminium foil the nano coated aluminium foil and I’m assuming it would be a thinner layer ?<br>[Rick]:好，我看到这里有其他的问题，提姆问你在电容器上的电池使用多少甘斯，甘斯需要多厚？你提到了卷起的铝箔，纳米涂层铝箔，我可以假设它较薄吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It doesn’t matter how thick or how thin   you’ll the find out because of the nano layering only what is needed will be held. If you put your capacitors or the batteries in a system where you can’t see the field interaction  or its aura you will soon understand that the energy is not much difference it just to give you a more powerful system because of the mass. Let me go back on one simple thing instead of making these three stackers with 2 coil inside each other split you stackers into one coil  vertical 1 coil horizontal, what I call magnetic and equatorial coil and then you test with the weakest system so in a way if you look at it, one system, one core, can be as powerful as putting the three together but at least use your starting point to build the first space ship. In this way you will change a lot of things. In yesterday’s Rick’s workshop, guy there was a guy they can put the link up they can listen to it or if you can’t put ever since I never touched a single voltmeter of a single screw or whatever and I made such a crude system that I get 80% efficiency where the system power units are prenominal 33%.<br>它的厚薄并不重要，你会发现，只有必要的纳米层才会被保持。如果把电容器或电池放在一个你看不到场的互动和光环系统里，你很快就会明白，能量没有太大的区别，由于这个聚集它只是给你一个更强大的系统。让我回到一个简单的事情，不是产生分别有两个线圈的能量盒，而是将一个能量盒的线圈分开成一个垂直线圈，一个水平线圈，这就是我所说的赤道圈与磁力圈。然后用最弱的系统测试。以这样的方式观察，一个系统一个核心，拥有的能量可以和三个反应器叠放起来的能量盒相似。但至少你可以以此为起始点建造第一艘太空船。这样你会改变很多事情。昨天在瑞克的工作室，他们可以把一个人连接起来，他们可以用系统听。我从来没有接触过一个单螺杆的单电压表或其他类似的物体，我做了一个简陋的系统，得到80%的效率，系统单元只释放了前33%。<br> Let me explain to you in the coming time we are going to release a new power units at the same time will most probably send you once you complete  the research this small unit. This additional small unit if he can complete to the way we think(or take)   will become your power source. Where at the moment you plug your system into the power supply   this small unit will become the point of the energy supply  in the plasmatic condition. It is based on the split battery condition  but powerful enough to create enough energy that it can be used by the system to generate the cognition of the plasma as you need for the space reactors.  So in a way you feed your system directly from the box each star formation to each leg  or what we call basereactor   you don’t need to rely on anything else in motion and in structure.<br>让我解释一下，在未来的时间内，我们将释放一个新的能量单元，同时一旦你完成了研究，最有可能送你这个小单元。如果这个附属小单元能按我们设想的方式完成，它将成为你的能量来源。当你把系统插入到电源，这个小单位将成为等离子条件下的能源供应点。它是基于分离电池的条件，但强大到足以创造足够的能量，它可以被系统运用，为空间反应堆产生提供有认知的等离子体。因此，你可以直接从这个盒子给你的系统提供能量，从每一个星型组合到每一个能量盒，用你供应自己系统的方式直接从反应盒到每一个恒星形成的每一条腿的形成，或是我们所称的基底反应堆。你在运动和结构中不需要依赖于任何事物。<br>The energy supply is completed and by adding the system of the split coil   we have managed to create a new power supply system. The next step as I said teach you the process of how to control   how to bring about a full control of a system, that you do not overdo it but please I advise you remember a few things. When you set up your stacker units or a single unit make sure you have at least 30 to 50 cm gap from the earth level<br>so your systems have to sit, not on the ground or on the solid table connected to nothing. You try to make a position that they all lock like a tray  but in this tray is at least free  it does not sit flat like these papers on the table. The reason for it is that your fields coming from everywhere has the free interaction within plasma does not go to the matter state up.<br>能源供应已完成，并通过增加系统的分离线圈，我们已经成功地创建一个新的能量供应系统。下一步就是教你们如何控制，如何构建一个完整的控制系统，你不要做的太过。但建议你们记住几件事。建立能量盒单元或一个单元时确保与地平面留有30至50厘米的间隙，你的系统不能在地上，也不能在没有与其他东西连接的固定的桌子上。你试着制造这样一个位置，他们都被固定像一个托盘一样，但在这个托盘是必须空的，不能像这些桌子上平放的纸张一样。这样做的原因是磁场从各个空间方向过来并自由的与等离子体相互作用，而不会形成物质状态。<br> The other point you have to remember is don’t forget that connecting your bases together and connecting your bases to your top set. Everything has to be nano coated as I was explaining yesterday or the day before when you made your stacker units   complete connections with the plasma battery supplies or whatever   just live it in the caustic same caustic for 10 minutes that you cover any possible scratches and nano material being removed  that you have with the matters state, what I call the final act before you tied up together.  So yesterday one of the people who were showing the systems in Rick’s teaching the beautiful way to connect now you have the lines and then you twist them together, he does a very beautiful job. He takes a two line and takes the other line and twist this one around here  continue to your flow of the plasma, it’s beautiful to see how people develop simple systems. You just bring them together and you turn this one right here and you turn one this one right here.<br>Little technics makes a lot of difference<br>要记住的另一点是不要忘记把你的基底反应器连在一起（画了一个黄圈），把你的基础和顶部设置连起来（在顶部画了一个盒子与线）。当制作能量盒单元的时候，一切都要像昨天或前天讲解的进行纳米涂层。用等离子电池供应完成连接，就这样使其保持10分钟同样的焦散状态，覆盖任何物质状态可能的划痕和移除的纳米材料，即我所说的将他们捆绑到一起之前最后的一步。昨天一位在瑞克的教学中，有一个人展示了这个系统，他连接的方式很美妙。你把线缠绕在一起，他做的非常好。他取出两条线，用另一条缠绕这条线，又用右边这条线缠绕左边这条线，使等离子流继续流动。看看人们如何开发简单的系统是很奇妙的事情。你只要把他们放在一起（画了最下面一条线），将这个转向这里（右边绕向左边的线），将左边绕向右边。小技术会产生很大效用。<br>[Rick]: In electrical wires they call that a western union, as a way to join the two wires together   western union<br>[Rick]: 所谓的西部联盟电报公司的电线，是用一种方式把两根电线连接起来。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: something new every day. Any other questions? No more questions?<br>[Mr. Keshe]:每天都有新事物。还有其他问题吗？没有问题吗？<br>[Rick]: sorry, I brought the motors in here motors<br>[Rick]: 不好意思，这里蒙特斯有问题，蒙特斯请讲。<br>[Mortars]: Hello Mr Keshe, I start working on some units and I would like show and it is good idea to set up in this way. So I hang them in this way so, can you hear me? Hello?<br>[Mortars]:你好凯史先生，我是从某个单元着手的，我想展示一下，这样开始会比较好。我把它们这样连接起来，您能听到我讲话吗?<br>[Mr Keshe]: yes yes<br>[Mr Keshe]: 是的，可以。<br>[Mortars]: so I hang them this way and it’s very stable so you can shake it and it’s very easy to get to if you need to do some work to them<br>[Mortars]: 我把它们这样连接起来，它们很稳固，如果这样晃它也没有很大问题。这样如果用它工作很方便。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I tell you something before you go further. This is wrong very wrong. I was explaining this yesterday to another knowledge seeker, first of all, all the frame you used because you work in the plasma condition has to nano coated all the bars all the beams all the wires. Secondly if you, the way you connected these together now you have made the connection of mishmash between the gravitational and magnetic and literally you coils are becoming useless.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 我想在你继续讲之前告诉你一些事。这样做是错的，有很大问题。我昨天向一个知识寻求者解释过，因为要在等离子的环境下工作，所以你的整个框架，包括竖金属条，横梁和金属线都必须用纳米镀层。第二，如果你这样把它们连接在一起，引力场和磁场都是混乱的，严格来说，你的线圈也是无用的。<br>[Mortars]: It’s like how they are touching here?<br>[Mortars]: 像它们这样的接触？（手所指）<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No your band the ring with the bands the way with your connections. You see the problem is you go to realize matter state still is part of the plasma strength now if you look at let’s call the bottom one about one Set 1, Set 2 in the middle and Set 3 to the top all your systems are connected to each other just one piece. The way you should do it first of all you should nano coat system. Secondly you can do what I call the strength by strength all the magnetic together all the gravitational so if you look at the turn around, I need you to turn upside down the other way can you change the, your picture sideway you need to turn it 90 degrees are<br>you there? Hello?<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 不是，是指框架的圈，把线圈缠一起的环，还有你连接的方式不对。问题是你仍然把物质状态作为等离子强度的一部分，如果给底部的环命名为系统一，中部的为系统二，顶部的为系统三，你所有的系统都只是用一个互相连接的，只有一点，首先你应该把系统进行纳米涂层。其次，你可以逐步加强所有的磁力场和引力场，让磁力场都连接在一起，让引力场都连接在一起。我需要你把它颠倒一下，改变照片角度，你需要把照片转动90度。你还在吗？你好？<br>[Robert]: Yeah we are here I think Mortar had some problem<br>[Robert]: 是的，我们在这里，我认为蒙特斯那里出了点状况。<br>[Mr Keshe]: okay so what you look you got 4 beams coming down？ the way it stands all gravitation or magnetic rings are connected to each other in every shape or form. You need to use for example one of the options is to use a diagonal, hello? Hello?<br>[Mr Keshe]: 好的，那么当你去掉四根横梁时你看到了什么？所有的引力场和磁场无论以任何形式或者架构都能互相连接。例如你需要使用选择之一是使用一个斜线。你好？你好？<br>[Robert]; I had to mute everybody because the line just dropped<br>[Robert]：我必须消音，因为刚刚掉线了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay, I want to go on my camera and I show you what I mean, if you look at the structure he had you have the 4 legs and then between these 4 legs you have a coil 2 coils which are going either way. What you got to do for example you connect the magnetic to these 2 legs and you gravitational to these 2 legs (I’m short of colour okay here I will give to you it’s easy). So you are connected here and there and connected here to here, so your magnetics does not touch you gravitational this is one of the options you have.<br> So the next one when you have the tube you connect the same way the magnetic to these legs and the gravitational to this leg. And the third one. Do not connect these together it’s a total mistake and secondly they need the space equal to half the diameter are so you need the gap between these and this one.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 好，我想回到镜头前，给大家讲一下。你看它的结构，它有4条腿，然后在这4条腿之间有一个，两个线圈以不同的方式固定。你要做什么，例如，你把磁力连接到这两条腿上，把引力连接到这2个腿上（我的笔颜色有限，我就这样画上去）。所以你要连接这里和那里（左右黄线涂上蓝色线），还要连接这里到这里（上下的黄线涂上蓝线），所以你的磁力触不到你的引力，这是一个选择。下一个选择是当你有个管子（在上面画了一个圈），你用相同的方式连接，磁力在这两条腿之间连接，引力在这两条腿之间。然后是第三个。不要把这些（竖的线圈）连接在一起（笔所指，两个黄圈之间）），这是完全错误的，其次，他们需要的距离要等于半径（上下线圈组之间的距离等于半径），你需要这个和这个之间留有间隔。<br>[Rick]: was a question several times whether the vertical coils needed the additional gap between them like you’re just describing thank you.<br>[Rick]:这个问题出现了很多次，就是如你描述的，垂直的线圈之间是否需要额外的间隔。谢谢解答。<br>[Mr. Keshe] the other things is when you have your 3 stackers and you have your beams here, leave a bigger space here you where you can place your batteries. The one we showed the ABC as part of the structure. Now you become self-sufficient independent power supply you don’t need to connect to a power supply anymore. One of the ways I suggested is if you get a copper tubes and make a hole so this hole is here and connect your copper tubes in an the angle here that in the way if you look at it your magnetic makes a frame outside and you gravitational make your frame inside you still keep on to the same structure gravitational being centre. So the two legs off your frame your magnetic goes the same and then you put the same with your gravitational at the bottom. You create a total independent unit so you can put this anywhere you just move it you carry your battery on board then when it comes to positioning of your star formation you have everything one room.<br>[Mr. Keshe]：另一件事情是，有三个能量盒，横梁在这里，在这里留一块更大的空间（将三条黑线向下延长了），可以用来放电池，这就是我刚才展示的作为结构一部分的ABC系统。这样你就成了独立的能量自供应系统，不再需要连接其他能源。我建议的一个方式是如果你有几根铜管，在中间穿个孔，这个孔就是这里（指的是左边横梁上）。然后将铜管的一个角（上面三角形）与这里（笔所指）连接，这样磁力制造了一个外围的框架，而引力在内部制造了一个的架构，于是这样成为同样的结构，引力成为中心。两条腿（中间的两条黑线）在结构之外，你的磁力还是以同样的方式（运动），同样还是把引力置于底部。你创造出一个完全独立的单元，可以将其放在任何地方。你只需移动它。将电池放在板上。当它位于（成为）星型组合的架构中，在这个空间内你可以拥有一切。<br>U never had this facility with the core you can still power a coil and changed space of the core you want but then you can move this back-and-forth move it with the slightly in and out till you literally see the shape and then you see, oh this side has a solid wall of the space ship but here is still elusive, you have to move this a little bit that way till you get part of it there but then you start moving till you get your space ship. Don’t forget we go back to the teaching of last week here on the top you are preferred to have two and then this should sit on the stack that he can be both again on this position is the first time you have the flexibility but don’t forget you’ll have to follow every step as we went through.<br>没有这个核心，就没有这个设备。你还是可以给线圈提供动力，按自己设想改变核心的位置，然后来回小幅移动它或者往里往外移动，直到可以看到这个形态，你能看到，宇宙飞船这一边就像有墙很坚实，但是这里边界还比较虚（隐蔽），所以要把这个这样移动一下，使这边可以更加结实。然后开始继续移动（画了一个线头），直到建成你的太空船。不要忘记回顾上周我们教的内容。在顶上的位置，最好有两个能量盒，这个应该位于这个反应器的上方（画了两条线，表示顶部与底部中间的反应器在一条线上），磁引力场可以重复作用（相交互影响）。在这个位置是你第一次获得灵活性，但是不能忘记你必须要按照我们经历的步骤走好每一步。</p>
<p> The capacitor battery A in way of B how stack it, in a way of how you can change it with amino acid even to match yours can do the B together to make C and you make a full power supply system. You have everything now the only thing is left for you if you want to do it, to make a system which is not matter dependant and you don’t need that. Who is that I see a picture of a face there?<br>这个电容，电池A如何在B中堆叠起来，如何用氨基酸改变它来适应自己，你可以将B结合起来形成C，也可以制作一个充足的能量供应系统。你现在万事具备，唯一缺乏的是你是否想要去做，去制作一个物质独立的系统，你不需要那样做。我看到一个人的照片，那是谁？<br>[Rick]: I think he want to ask some reactor combination and some questions probably, are you ready for that now or you want to present something else there Mr. Keshe?<br>[Rick]: 是马塞尔，他可能想要问关于反应堆结合类似的问题，您准备好回答这个问题了吗？还是您想先展示一些其他的问题，凯史先生？<br>[Mr Keshe]: – Hello? Is that the Marshall from Germany?<br>[Mr Keshe]: 你好，你是来自德国的马塞尔吗？<br>[Rick]: I believe so<br>[Rick]:我认为是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Hi are you Marcel from Germany or Marcel from Holland<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 嗨，马塞尔，你是来自德国还是来自荷兰？<br>[Marcel]: Nope, Marcel from Germany<br>[Marcel]: 我来自德国。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Marcel get in touch with me I have been looking for you I couldn’t find your link go through the webmaster and get in touch with me urgently please okay<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 马塞尔，请和我联系，我正在找你，但找不到你的链接。请迅速通过网络管理员联系我。<br>[Marcel]: okay<br>[Marcel]: 好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Go through Vince I need to speak to you very urgently, I have been looking for your link somehow I couldn’t find<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 我通过文斯联系到你，想尽快与你交流，所以一直在找你的连接，但是怎么也找不到。<br>[Marcel]: where I should go?<br>[Marcel]: 我应该怎么办？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No just after the teaching contact Vince and I need to speak with you something important I need to speak with you regarding the Keshe foundation in Germany, okay thanks very much.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 在课程结束之后与文斯联系，我需要跟你谈一些重要的事情。我需要跟你谈一下德国的凯史基金会。好的，非常感谢。<br>[Rick]: So Marcel sent me some pictures of his margrave unit and we can have a look at those and is that what you want to comment on Marcel. Hello? Is that what you wanted to comment on was the your margrave units<br>[Rick]: 马塞尔发给我一些他的磁引力单元设备的图片，我们现在来看一下，你想要评价一下它吗？你想要对磁引力设备发表一些看法吗？<br>[Marcel]: Yes, I have a question about it and I would to make a mini bar graph for my eBay(ebike), sorry first I have to say my English is not perfect sometimes I didn’t know the right word. So I hope it works.<br>[Marcel]:是的，我有一个问题，我想对我的电动自行车做一个小型条形图。首先很抱歉我的英语不是很好，有时候我不知道正确的单词，我希望这样可以顺利沟通下去。<br>[Rick]: Okay now let me get this set up, just a minute here okay there we go<br>[Rick]: 好的，现在让我来开始，就一会儿，好的，开始。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What are we looking at?<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 我们现在看到的是什么？<br>[Rick]: Okay go ahead Marcel.<br>[Rick]: 好的，马塞尔请继续。<br>[Marcel]: This is my margrave that I have built in Germany from a German balma I would like to say. It was very cheap, it’s running and it works.<br>[Marcel]: 这是我从德国balma建立的磁引力单元，它耗费低，它能工作运行<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What do you mean it works?<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 它能工作是什么意思？<br>[Marcel]: Pardon<br>[Marcel]:请再说一遍</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: What do you mean by it works exactly？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 你说他能工作确切是指什么？<br>[Marcel]; the unit its working I am electronic man but I thought it could be so I did make some maintenance and so on, but the unit its working<br>[Marcel]：这个设备在工作是说，我是一个电工，所以我对它进行了一些维修，但是这个设备是可以运行的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: what is the reduction in the power?<br>[Mr Keshe]: 电力的减弱是什么？<br>[Marcel]: Sorry<br>[Marcel]: 不好意思，我没有听清楚。<br>[Mr. Keshe] I said what is your reduction in the power with your unit?<br>[Mr. Keshe] 我是说这个设备中节省电量的情况是什么样子的？<br>[Marcel]: I have 10% measured on every phase, so I have 30% on 3 phases. I did measure it like you show in the last knowledge seeker or before that and I got I got on phase 10% fading, and I put some heater on it and I did it too far, normally I had for around 3 weeks but I am don’t wait so I did it a little bit fast so those days I put 10Watts only night and day and they I put heater with 400Watts out of 4 days for about 10 minutes all time still on and after 6 or 7 day I put 1.2kW on it connect and this compare with my main unit, measure unit in the house but I saw no savings so, then I did in the way you say in the last teaching and I see 10% savings on one phase<br>[Marcel]: 我估算每阶段会节省10%，三个阶段节省30%。我像上一个知识寻求者那样估算过，我算出有能量在一阶段减少了10%，我给它加载了加热器，但是我做的有点过分，一般我会用三周时间，但是我没有耐心等，所以我加热的有点快，在前几天我白天和晚上都用10瓦特，然后我连续四天都用400瓦特加热10分钟，到第六七天之后，我用1200瓦的热量加热。和我主要的设备相比，测量家中设备时，我看到没有剩余的电量，所以我按照上周课程讲过的方法，然后得出每阶段有10%的剩余。<br>[Mr Keshe]: so unit at the end and you put all your load before between the metre and the unit<br>[Mr Keshe]:所以，最后你在电表和设备之间加入这些负荷。<br>[Marcel]: yes and I compared  write it down and there was 10% savings and now I have disconnected to the unit from my living room to my computer room where I have all my computers, my boxes, sound speakers and my DSL and router  and put it on the wall and all things are running  and I leave it now for next month to see if my if my cable gets coated so lets wait, but I have a next question I wanted to ask I wanted to build a mini margrave for my e-bike so my e-bike is only working on DC<br>[Marcel]:是的，我比较之后进行了记录，发现有10%的剩余能量。现在我把这个设备放到由卧室搬到了电脑房，里面有我的电脑，音箱，数字用户线，路由器，把设备放在墙上，所有的电器都可以工作，我要把它留到下个月，看我的电缆是否能有涂层。让我们拭目以待。但是我还有一个问题，我想为我的电子自行车建一个小型的磁引力场，它只能使用直流电。<br>[Mr Keshe]：Can I ask you a question?<br>[Mr Keshe]：我能问你个问题吗？<br>[Marcel]:yes?<br>[Marcel]:什么问题呢？<br>[Mr Keshe]：You said you nut ten watts and then connected it to 1.2kwatts?<br>[Mr Keshe]：你说你之前是用的10瓦特，之后变成用1200瓦特？<br>[Mr Keshe]：No, 10watts, two days, night and day long. At once, on the third day, I put 400 hundred watts on it, all long day ten minutes, on half and hour, on the whole day. On the next day, I put on 800 watts, and then the other day 1.2 k watts. After that, I put 1.2k watts around half and hour. In the evening, I sit in my living room, it’s cold so I am always bitter. And sometimes, it’s on for 30 minutes, so when I am frustrated, I put it on and see what will happen to this unit. So it’s running perfectly. After all, in other days, so ,okay, I make some memory, I have wrote it down, and make it shows like in the videos and I got 10% savings in the space in my living room. And now I run in my computer room was also 6 mornings ..control. And normally, as an electronic man, the unit couldn’t run because of the high resisters(电阻器). From the picture we can see, in my factory, they are good, very good. To measure it. The high resisters normally electric is not good though , but in plasma, we use the（ expand all the visual, must rock. ）有问题<br>开始的时候是用10瓦，用了整整两天。在第三天，我使用过了400瓦的热量，一开始是加热10分钟，然后变成一个半小时，最后变成一整天。后面的一天，我使用800瓦，再后来加到了1200瓦。之后，我用了大概半小时1200瓦。晚上，我坐在卧室，非常冷，很难过，有时候会持续30分钟，当我很沮丧时，然后想看看这个设备会发生什么，它运行的很完美。后来，我决定把这个记录下来,写下来，使它变成了录像中的样子。我记录下来，我的卧室省了10%的电量。现在它已经在我的电脑房里工作了六天，当然这要进行控制。正常情况下，作为一个电工，我知道这个设备因为高电阻而不会运行。从图片中可以发现，在我的“工厂”中，它们很好，非常好。为了测量，高电阻器并不十分有效，但是它扩大了我们的视野。<br>But now I have a question,   I wanted to build a mini margrave for my e-bike so my e-bike is only working on DC. so the idea is I want to make a 9V like what I put here, yesterday I did gans which acquire object, we put a combination of ganses on it, 3 copper gans and put on it and close with my special 2k glue and then I will use it, put it on a step up convertor, it’s an electronic device that you can step up the voltage from 9V to 30V and I want to feed this in my new coil to put up the voltage maybe from 9V to 27V for my e-bike normally runs on 24 Volts but I tuned so it runs on 27 so it runs a little bit fast and now I want to make a mini margrave as a power source for instead of the normal echos, my question is can I is this for my e-bike, I have made a mini margrave, a mini core already and new coils, I wanted them a little bit different  than in this margrave<br>但是我现在有一个问题，我想为我的电动自行车建一个小型磁引力场，但它只能使用直流电。所以我想使用9伏特电压，昨天我从物体中获取甘斯，我们把甘斯的结合体放在里面，三份铜甘斯放进去，把特殊的胶水放进去，把它放进转换器里，这是一种电气设备，可以把9伏特电压转换成30伏特。我想把它用在我的线圈里，可以为我的电动自行车把电由9伏特转为27伏特。通常它需要24伏特电，但是我想把它转为27伏特，这样它可以速度变快。现在我想要先制作一个小型磁引力场作为电力来源代替原来的传统电源。我的问题是，我能不能这样改我的电动车，我已经做了一个磁引力场，小的核心和新线圈。我想要它们在这个磁引力场中有点不同。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Let me tell you before we go a step further, what you can do is what I call a spiral split plasma batteries, what this is(if you can go to share my screen )can we go back on my full-screen<br>[Mr Keshe]: 在继续向前探讨之前我先告诉你，我把你要做的设备称之为一个螺旋分裂等离子电池，这是什么（如果你能回到我的屏幕），我们可以回到我的全屏吗？<br>[Robert]: No you have to start screen share<br>[Robert]:现在你可以在屏幕上分享。<br>[Mr Keshe]: so what you done up to now is your, what are called the negative of street your split battery or plasma and you went like this. What you can do you can make a coil of the centre wrap it with the gans and nano coated material and then you split it with the coil, split coil again so your inner system you make it to a spiral, depends how you work with this you will find a much more powerful system. In energy development and release instead of using a single wire which you been using up to now user a twisted coil inside as negative. So this give you a more powerful system and in fact you can literally what we do we test it you’ll see it, is you can even put a single core in the middle put a spiral with a gans and a nano coated material and then gans and the nano material again, copper or aluminium or Titanium and the you put another spiral on it.And then in fact you have a three system centre and in all three you’ll have to make sure you go on the feedback.<br>[Mr Keshe]: 你现在要做的是，这是分离等离子电池的负极，你要这样做。你现在能做的是可以做一个包围中心的缠绕线圈，其中有甘斯，并且要覆盖纳米涂层材料。然后用线圈将其分离，再分离，这样内部就会形成一个螺旋。根据你使用它的不同情况，你会发现一个在能量发展和释放方面更加强大的系统。现在使用缠绕的线圈代替单线，内部作为负极。这会使系统更加强大，事实上，通过测试你可以看到。你甚至可以把一个单核心放在中间，外围放一个螺旋，螺旋被甘斯与纳米材料包起来，再放一层甘斯和纳米材料，铜，铝或者钛（的纳米材料）。然后你把另一颗螺旋放进去。事实上，你就有一个三系统中心，在三个系统中，必须确保你可以进行反馈。<br>What is means this is (you have been out of the picture) you have your centre you put the coil to you can make even this is split coil and feedback and take up as one point nano coat it  put a material on it and then put a 2nd spiral on it on top of this. This system will give you a more powerful battery condition that you might use especially if you want to use for a powerful DC. So your system works spiral nano coated, with the nano coated material with the gans and then to split the spiral on top of it, this gives you a more powerful system and if you want to use the centre beam that you connect to it you find out that you will achieve a huge power supply as a plasma supplier battery. This should give you anything up to about, four of them should give you about 6 to 8 Volts and just about something just over 2 to 400 mA when you use them as stacker unit and this is a way you can amplify using plasma is, I will teach you in the coming time the amplifier amplifying plasma, can be by the way you do it, it can absorb accelerate and stop.<br>这意味着（你的图像不见了）你有你的中心，将线圈放在这里，你可以做一个分离的线圈和反馈（下面画的线圈），将这个取出作为一个长点，用纳米给其涂层，或者在上面涂材料，再把第二个螺旋放在它上面。这个系统能为你提供更加有力的电池条件，尤其你想要使用有力的直流电。所以你的系统是螺旋工作的。带有纳米涂层材料和甘斯，将上面一层的螺旋分离，这可以给你更加动力充足的系统。如果你想要使用中心的横梁（中间的长线），你可以把它连起来（螺旋线圈与中间横梁相连），这样就能实现强大的等离子电池电力供应。这个可以提供很多能量。四个这样的系统应该能给你6到8伏特，当把它们作为一个能量盒，有时候只是2到400毫安。这是你放大使用等离子的方法。我将在以后教大家如何放大等离子。你可以用自己的方式使它加速和停止。</p>
<p>[Marcel]: Can I show you my coil, how can I do that<br>马修：我可以向你们展示一下我做的线圈吗，我要怎么做？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You got to share the screen<br>凯：你需要打开你的视频，向我们分享你的屏幕。<br>[Rick]: what you need to, you want to share your video, you need to have the video ready to share first and then click on the share screen button at the bottom<br>瑞：如果你要分享的话，首先就要打开视频摄像头，然后点击下方的分享视频按钮。<br>[Marcel]: I mean last video<br>马：我说的是上一个视频。<br>[Rick]: Then you just need to do is start you video okay just a second here and try that<br>瑞：你只需要开始视频就可以了，等一下然后开始吧。<br>[Marcel]: Okay yes its fine, Hello Mr.Keshe nice to see you, this is my design of the coil for my e-bike mini margrave so …<br>好的，现在好了。你好凯史先生，很高兴见到你，这是我为电动车小型磁引力场设计的线圈，所以……<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can you hold it up a little bit oh you use things I used to use a lot of those water pipes<br>凯：你能把手上拿的东西往上拿近一点吗，哦，你用的材料就是我之前用的，我用了很多这种水管。<br>[Marcel]: Yes because they fire resistance and perfect for this. Okay I want to put later if the coil is finished in that case, and then can I put into my e-bike ？<br>马：是的，因为它不易燃，非常适合做实验材料。好了，之后再说这个，请问您看我这个线圈是该这样做吗，然后我能把它装进电动自行车里吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: stop it, stop it.you know that white piece what is it? what is in the yeah<br>凯：等一下，等一下，中间的白色管子是什么啊？<br>[Marcel]: This is the field gans. It’s completed. I closed it with 2K component<br>马：这个是已经做好了的磁场甘斯，我用了2K元件把它合上了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what is made of?<br>凯：它是用什么做的？<br>[Marcel]:  it’s copper and CH3 gans, this is normal electric (what do I call it)<br>马：是铜和CH3甘斯，这是普通电力的…<br>[Rick]: Is this pvc?<br>瑞：是聚氯乙烯吗？<br>[Marcel]: Yes used to make …<br>马：是的。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Okay unwind this up, take this out, instead of white material use there use like aluminium pipe, gans coated and do the same job you will have more power<br>凯：好了，把这个装置展开，把白色的这个材料拿出来，换成甘斯涂层的铝管，然后继续原来的步骤，你会得到更多能量。<br>[Marcel]: The coil is already gans coated<br>马：这个线圈就是甘斯涂层的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes, but the white piece in your hands, take that white piece out, take it instead of plastic take aluminium or lets say, even a steel pipe, nano coated and put the gans inside it and you will have to connect bottom of these two itself that you restore and energize the system .this is draining the system this is what we call you drain it because you have to make this into two half coils, you will get them a more powerful system<br>凯：但是，你要把手中的白色物件拿出来，用纳米涂层的铝管或者钢管替换塑料管，然后加入甘斯，再把两者的底部相连接，这样你就可以为系统储存并提供能量。这就是系统的排放装置，这就是我说的排放，这就是我们所说的释放能量，因为这个装置分为两个半线圈，这样就会从中获得更多能量。<br>[Marcel]: okay I have to coat it one margrave instead of one magnetic and one gravitational and go back .one question about the capacitor I did here, at the end, i did include the capacitor to go from plasma state to matter state when I have…<br>马：好的， 我需要在外围缠绕一个磁引力线圈，而不是一个磁力线圈和引力线圈，然后再返回。还有一个关于电容器的问题，我在装置的底部装了一个电容器，使其由等离子状态变为物质状态…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You don’t need to do that the system will decide itself<br>凯：你不用这样做，系统会自动转换。<br>[Marcel]: but for the e-bike I need 10A<br>马：但是我的电动车需要10安。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: It will give it to you if its strength is there. it will give it to you. In your bike you are using a DC as a power. but in fact your system is an AC isn’t it, it alternating. that’s why it runs i think so.<br>凯：如果系统的强度有这么大就能为你提供电动车所需的能量。你的电动自行车是用DC作为能量，但实际上你的系统是AC，对吗？能量需要交替转换，我想这就是它能运行的原因。<br>[Marcel]: So I have to convert the plasma DC and method is the capacitor, so I would like to make capacitor here and go out to the e-bike. I would like to feed with normal 9V battery but next week I get the up convertor, so I can change the voltage maybe I need 27 for my e-bike. I adjust it to 27, feed it in my mini margrave, take the power of the margrave and put it in my e-bike that’s my idea<br>马：那我要通过电容器转换等离子DC，那就要把电容器放在这一端，然后拿出去放到电动自行车里试一下。我想先用9V 的普通电池，下周再加上转换器，这样我就能改变电压，也许我的电动车需要27V，这样我就可以把它调到27，把它放到小型磁引力系统中，从而通过该系统为电动车供能。这是我目前的想法。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: Yes but what is important is that how much power can you produce with one coil? You need a number of them and for that kind of thing you don’t need to use such a thick wire. It can go to smaller diameters and you can make multiples of them. One of those things which we understood at the very beginning when we did a coca cola bottle was there a limit to how many numbers of a, how much voltage you can take in a  line so understanding that you have to decide how many absent bows you gotta take and make it parallel<br>凯：可以。关键是这个仅有一个线圈的装置可以提供多大的能量？这样的话，你就需要很多这样的装置，而不是用一根很粗的电线。这个装置的直径可以再小一点，这样你就可以大批量制作。有件事情你要知道，像我们开始学习的时候那样，我们在做可口可乐瓶的时候，对一条线上能承受多大电压是否有限定？那么你就知道你需要多少这样弹簧，注意要把它们平行放置。<br>[Marcel]: Okay i thought that thickness of the copper wire decide how many Amps I can get in the matter so this normal 1.4 in Germany we say 1.5 square root so yeah my English is not perfect. So I can get out the matter state 16Amps and my bike needs 10Amps so I thought I have to use this thickness, because when I use too much it will melt<br>马：好的。我之前在想是不是铜线的粗细决定我能从这个装置中获得多少安的电量，那我就用这个通用的德国制造的1.4mm的铜线，也就是1.5的平方根，抱歉，我的英文不是很好，这样我就可以从这个装置中获得16安，而我的电动车只需10安，那我就用这种铜线就可以了，因为之前我用得久了它就会融化。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yeah but if you you mean the cable from you bike will melt<br>凯：你是说电动车上的电线会融化吗？<br>[Marcel]: no this one, no?<br>马：不，是这个装置上的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: if you nano coat it well enough it not should melt<br>凯：如果这个装置是纳米涂层的，就不会融化。<br>[Marcel]: Yes nano coating is perfect, I have some, I make some gans here and tried first I started for about 3 week or 4 weeks ,earlier I did order a gans kit about 6 months or so and I produce my gans but I forget all this and I happened, I saw again some of your Keshe foundation and I started again because it is practical, I am a practical man not theoretical, I have to build and play around. so fire coating is I think perfect, I would like to start with this NHO coating but then I saw a video when you explain that fire coating is effective is better, so I did everything fire coat and it looks perfect. I tried something long firing, with different heats and it was best I think fire coating. Okay thank you very much for your answer<br>马：是的，纳米涂层真的很好用。我之前制造了一些甘斯，大约3、4个星期前，我开始尝试，早前大概是半年前，我订了制作甘斯的装备，然后开始制造，不过之后就放在一边了，后来，偶然间我又看到关于凯史基金会的一些信息，就又开始这项工作了，因为现在是可以实际操作的，我是一个实干派不喜欢纯理论的东西，然后我就开始建造系统，不断尝试，目前觉得用火烧法制造纳米涂层真的很适用，我之前想用NHO涂层，但后来看到您的教学视频中说火烧法比较有效，所以之后都是用火烧纳米涂层，确实好用。我曾试过长时间的火烧，间或使用不同热量，发现这种就是最好的。好了，非常感谢您能解答我的疑问，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: please Marcel get in touch with me through webmaster, I lost you contact in changing computer somewhere, so need to speak with you I was looking for you I couldn’t find you<br>凯：马塞尔，记得通过网站管理员与我一直保持交流，之前换电脑时与你失去联系，所以要跟你说下之前一直试图联系你，始终无果。<br>[Marcel] Okay thank you<br>马：好的，我知道了，谢谢您。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: Thank you very much<br>凯：十分感谢。<br>[Rick]: Thank you Mr Keshe<br>瑞：谢谢您，凯史先生。<br>[Mr Keshe]: I want to teach you something that we went through with Marcel. there is a system you can build ,what we call cross batteries, cross batteries or power supplies are not something which is normal. The cross batteries is where you take spiral and you repeat the same process. this is your outlet. you repeat the same process of nano coating and cables and the rest of it in the splits half and half ,where your half all the 4 feet to the same base and you have power  from the outer coil ,the others split out where you can dictate it in a way, the system of power supply connected to one centre. this has a lot of advantages and this very extremely powerful but it gives you the beauty with this is the stability of the supply you don’t get that much fluctuation, it very consistent.<br>凯：接下来我要跟你们讲一下刚才和马塞尔交谈时涉及的问题。我们可以建造这样一个系统，叫做十字形交叉电池，这种交叉电池不是寻常的电池，像我画的这样，它是四条螺旋电线，这条线是出口，然后将这四条线都加上纳米涂层、电线和之前所讲的其它元件，将这四条螺旋线都分成两半，位于根部的四条半线通向同样的底部，然后就会从外面分离的四半线圈中获得能量，这样来引导他们，系统都与一个中心相连，你可以由此控制整个系统，这样有很多好处，且能量巨大，还有一个好处就是供能稳定，不会用很大波动，非常持久。<br>because you have your base coming up and then you have your four where your 4 coils or straight lines whatever you call it, this will feed into one supplier, this will feed into one supply this will do the same and this do the same ,but at the same time your second half coil will feed to the same base .this is a capacitance so somewhere to create a stable output continuously from the 4, this is one of the best ways to create a powerful plasma condition power supply ,where all your  bases come to one base and work through one base. This is a combination between the parallel and the series, you decide how, but because continues to supply comes from all 4 ,we use a very stable power supply. For the systems like a bike or that kind of thing you need this kind of power supply.<br>因为当这个基座建成后，也就是这四个线圈或四条直线，这一条可以向外供能，这一条也可以向外供能，其余二条也是这样，但同时，每个线圈另半部分线圈的能量会通向同一个基座，这就是电容，所以如果想要从这四个线圈中创造稳定持续的供能系统，这就是创造等离子电池的最佳方案，在这个结构中，所有的能量都会汇集到一个中心，并流经于此（笔所指），这就是平行装置和系列装置的结合，这都由你来决定，但由于持续不断的能量来自四个线圈，所以我们使用的能量来源稳定持续。对于像电动车类的装置，这样的结构恰好可以满足其需求。<br>Any other questions?<br>有问题吗？<br>[Rick]: Yes of course you d<br>瑞：有。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Its new year don’t you want to go your new year’s party a<br>凯：现在正值新年，大家都不想去参加新年聚会吗？<br>[Rick]:It’s a long ways away for me still in terms of hours, but some parts of the world its already new year’.  It’s hard to conceive that we are in the same planet we celebrate the new year at different times it doesn’t make sense to me but<br>瑞：就时间来看，我们离新年还有好几个小时，但世界上有些地方正在庆贺新年。很难相信，我们生活在一个地球上，却在不同的时间庆祝新年，这对我来说，也没什么意义。<br>[Mr Keshe]: What are you going to do when you’re in the space<br>凯：如果你在太空，你会做什么？<br>[Rick]: That’s it and the sun is always there all the time so do you have a holiday all the time?<br>瑞：就说嘛，太阳永远在那里，你会一直都有假期吗？<br>[Mr Keshe]: It’s a holiday time<br>凯：现在就是假期时间。<br>[Rick]: Luca are you there? Let me see<br>瑞：卢卡，你在吗？让我看一下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You know what is funny when you talk about this, it is also spring caloline  yesterday . in the northern hemisphere we go in winter and the people in the south because it’s hot they come to the north to be cooler and then the one in the summertime go to south to the cooler to be warmer so as a human race we are never happy to what we have ,doesn’t matter where we are, and that is why we travel all the time to find somewhere slightly different even for a few hours or a few days and this holiday season shows we have a lot of it. People from all over the world to move for a few days of warmth or cold or whatever they like to play and what are going to do in space constant temperature constant pressure constant everything.<br>凯：你知道当我们谈论这些的时候，什么才是最有趣的吗？卡洛琳昨天还在春天…在北半球，我们已进入冬天，而南半球的人因为那里比较热都来到北半球避暑，然后北半球的人在夏天时去南半球避暑。所以说，人类从不满足于当前他们所拥有的，无论在哪儿，所以我们就到处旅游，寻找不同的地方，哪怕是几个小时或是几天，而这个假期给我们带来了很多东西。地球上很多地方的人从温暖或寒冷的地方不断走动，那么在太空恒定的温度、压力和恒定的所有条件下，人们还会做什么呢？<br>[Rick]: That’s true most people might get to, a lot of people easily get bored it with that because they wouldn’t get the what they call the change of seasons that they look forward to the variety of old cold and warm and so on, so as humans we tend to crave that although some people to just create seeking the sun all the time as well.<br>瑞：是的。可以确定的是很多人很快就会厌烦，因为他们没有感受到季节的变化，因此会怀念以前寒冷或温暖的天气，尽管一些人仍一直要寻找太阳，但我们还是渴望这样变换的季节。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: They have a month in Italy around May which they call the sleeper time where you change from winter to summer and people are always want to sleep lunchtime afternoon they are always sleepy, so will have the sleeper time in the space?<br>凯：在意大利五月份被他们成为睡眠时间，因为此时正经历从冬天到夏天的季节转换，人们吃过午饭会觉得很困，所以就会午睡，那么在太空中会有这样的睡眠时段吗？<br>[Rick]: while they actually changed the laws in Italy so that the stores are shut down in the afternoon so they can have their sleep time or the nap time, even the police have nap time because they don’t seem to give tickets during that time of the day<br>瑞：当意大利人真的改变了这项规则后，每天下午商店都会关门，这样他们就能有休息时间或者是小憩时间，甚至警察每天下午都有休息时段，因为他们在这段时间不会抓人。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The beauty is will we have a siesta in space and how long will be for? Okay what’s the next question<br>凯：奇妙的是太空中会午休吗，又会是多久呢？好了，下一个问题是什么？<br>[Rick]: I’m trying to find Luca I’m not sure if you are actually there now Luca I can’t see you name up.<br>瑞：我在找卢卡，卢卡，不知道你在不在，我没有看到你的名字。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Is Brad on the line<br>凯：布莱德在吗？<br>[Rick]: I am not seeing him right now<br>瑞：我没看到他。<br>[Me Keshe]: has he been online today<br>凯：他今天在线吗？<br>[Rick]: I haven’t seen him today no<br>瑞：今天没看到他。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: Vince, have you seen him around today<br>凯：文斯，你今天看到他了吗？<br>[Vince]: Yap he is in the hospital<br>文：嗯。他在医院。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Ok I am trying to reach him<br>凯：这样啊，我一直在找他。<br>[Rick]: Okay how about Sylvester i know that your hand up earlier we brought you in as a panelist, would you like to speak? Hello Sylvester<br>瑞：那西尔维斯特呢，我之前看到你举手了，我把你加入专题讨论小组里了，你好，西尔维斯特。<br>[Sylvester]: Yes hello, yes good afternoon, good morning everyone. is my pleasure to listen these teachings of the last teachings of the year with interesting and exciting things .I just wanted to say thank you for Mr. Keshe and for all the group of the spaceship institutes to make all these beautiful transition possible, it is amazing what Mr. Keshe was introduced to all of us about the spaceship, I was able to watch a few of these videos Mr. Keshe you mentioned that I’m now individuals able to achieve interesting sentiments about the spaceship formations of the plasma energy and things, so i’m really looking forward to setting up the doorman and the rest of the manufacturing team that manufacturing groups around the world.so I just like to say happy new year for everyone I am in south Korea working the setting things up in South Korea as well before I was in Hungary, setting things up in Hungary and now god bless everyone<br>西：你好，大家早晨或下午好。我非常荣幸能聆听今年最后一堂这么生动有趣的课程。我想向凯史先生、飞船研究所的所有成员，感谢你们制造了这么多精致有趣的转换装置。凯史先生向我们介绍的飞船知识非常生动，我也看了很多您推荐的教学视频，现在我是一个独立的个体了，有能力去实现关于创建等离子供能环境下的太空船结构，以及其他有新意的想法。我真的很期待凯史基金能有一个“看门人”，并在世界的其它角落建立凯史基金会的制造团队。我还想说，祝大家新年快乐。我现在在韩国，和之前在匈牙利一样，我从事的是装配工作。愿上帝保佑。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thank you very much for your hard work. your holiday time is over very soon I hope<br>凯：非常感谢你，你的假期已经结束了吧。<br>[Sylvester]: I am already working, Mr.Keshe you know you raise the bar really high, so really like it and I don’t have a problem to do the work because as you mentioned the yes we have a Christian holiday right now, but you know people just are in the Muslim world and the Jewish or in Indian world or any other religious world it is  just  the same day. So we are in the plasma, the calendar and every day really have to work hard to make this a beautiful peaceful transition happen.<br>西：是的，我现在已经在工作了。凯史先生，您知道吗，您把这个摄像头抬得非常高，我很喜欢这样，工作中我也没有遇到什么问题，因为你提过，是的，我们这里有基督教假期，但对这里的穆斯林、犹太教徒以及印度教徒和其他宗教教徒来说，这并没无不同，都是一样的。现在我们处于等离子阶段，每一天都勤奋工作来实现这些美丽的转变。<br>[Mr Keshe]: I will tell you something very interesting when you speak about Korea.we don’t mention the name because we know what we call it. the situation with people who are trying to misuse the knowledge but we are strong in the way we do it .one of the major corporations in the world has as of last week pointed to some top scientists for a total commercial of the Keshe foundation to international production. You have to fight them soon I hope but there is a couple people in the group know who they are . They have appointed one of the top teams in our supply and electronics of the company, to start research and development on our plasma technology and soon they will announce the collaboration, It one of the household names around the world and one of the divisions tested the system and now they have gone to the final stage of the final evaluation for production and you have to move to the country for a while, it’s not very far from where you are. So that good news for you<br>凯：当你提到韩国时，我想到一些事情想要和大家分享。我不提名字，因为有些人想滥用这些知识，我们一定会坚持我们的方式。上周有一家全球知名企业表明让一些顶尖的科学家参与凯史基金会的商业化运作，实现国际化生产。你很快就要与他们很快就要与他们竞争，不过这个团队中很多人都知道自己的本分，他们已经认定其中一位科学家参与公司的生产和电子科技，研究和发展我们的等离子技术，之后会宣布合作，这家在世界上家喻户晓的组织，已经测试了这个系统，现在正在进行最后一轮生产测评，你要去那个国家呆上一阵子，那离你现在所在的地方并不远，这对你来说应该是个好消息。<br>[Sylvester]: thank you Mr.Keshe to forward we will make this happen<br>西：感谢您，凯史先生，我希望能快快实现。<br>[Mr Keshe]: I know we will I have a lot of good news will try not to put it up anymore until it’s totally, not established just that, they are the number for major<br>凯：接下来会有很多好消息，不过要等到都确定下来，我再通知大家。这些都是主要的…<br>[Sylvester]: secured?<br>西：确定了？<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yes secured. It is the same as what we have with the banking system, we won’t announce the bank which we’re taking over till it’s all done and dusted that  nothing can done the same as with the television station.<br>凯：是的，这就像我们的银行系统，直到一切都尘埃落定，我们真正接管银行，才会向大家宣布，电视台也是这样。<br>[Sylvester]: Mr Keshe looking forward any time to with you. I also wanted to share some things to which I come across about the banking system I would like to share this<br>西：凯史先生，期待与您能一直保持交流，我也希望能向您分享我遇到的一些关于银行机构的问题。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we already have signed ourselves into it we are becoming part as well and well done and done. It’s a gift from the government to us. very interesting I explained to you something while you’re on the phone I haven’t seen for a while. these people who write a and they have been writing to the government to the police to the banks, they are doing the biggest favour for the foundation actually, I will tell you what it is this it happen the past few days, they write to the police that is a fraud, a scam, and then the police come to investigate and say how come you’re here we didn’t know, but I thank you for introducing they are more pleasure to us than anything else, is the same as with the banking they wrote to the bank we are a fraud we are laundering money, all comes from that circle in Germany and the bank says we didn’t know there was such a thing, can we buy some share in the organisation then the Dutch manufacturing started, the bank your bank comes to buys shares .<br>我们已经签署合同，成为其中而一部分，而且目前进展不错，这是政府给我们的礼物。很有意义。我之前跟你们在电话中解释，有些人给政府、警察局、银行写信，事实上他们帮了我们很大的忙，跟你们说下前几天发生了什么事，他们给警察局写信说我们是假的，是骗局，然后警察开始调查，然后问我们是怎么来的，他们都不知道，但我谢谢你们把我们介绍给他们，他们很热情，银行也是这样的，他们给银行写信说我们是假的，在洗黑钱，这些都是德国那边出现的，银行称我们不知道有这样的事情，我们可以买这个机构的股票，比如新上市的荷兰制造公司，银行开始购买股票。<br>Same with police and the military, the military wants to know how they can use this. sterile to the army that we are terrorist organization and then now the army asks us just before we break, we talked to see how we can use the system for jamming off systems which are disarmed when they are trying to do something wrong, is more these people are writing to block us, the more the open door for us and the structure of the banking system comes through that way. The Italians and some of European governments have open their eyes. We have this technology we didn’t know about it these people write to them, so much we want to do ,you know these are terrorist, they money laundering they are doing the scam and in the government will come and a look to be part of the scam so the more the scam they right the more jobs they create for you<br>警察局和军队也是这样，军队想知道他们如何用如此苍白的话说我们是恐怖组织，在我们被攻破（黑客）之前，跟我们讨论我们是如何使用系统干扰系统的，能在他们（黑客）攻击之前就使他们解除武装。越多人写信阻止我们，就会有越多大门为我们敞开，银行体系结构就是通过这种方式形成的。意大利人和一些欧洲国家的政府已经打开了他们的国门。我们有这项技术，我们不知道这些人写信给他们，所以我们有很多想做的事情，你知道这些都是恐怖分子，他们在洗钱，他们设的都是骗局，政府来调查时也成为了骗局的一部分，因此会有更多的骗局，他们也为你创造更多的就业机会。<br>[Sylvester]: it is like it is like aikido you know we just using the force<br>西：它像是合气道，你知道我们只是在利用磁场力。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: they are doing us a lot of favour please write as many emails as you to bury police station we invite you because you have open a huge door for us write to all the militaries you have opened the huge door for us. We don’t think of it but the enemy do serve us very well they are of their own selves but it doesn’t matter but it is nice to see because of part of this work they have done you have a lot of work to do especially to set one or 2 factories in Italy.<br>凯：事实上，他们帮了我们很多忙。请尽情发电子邮件给警察局，我们诚邀您这样做，因为你向很多军队写信的同时为我们打开了一扇大门，这一切都多亏有你们。我们并不在意，但敌人为我们做了很多事情，他们是纯粹为了自己，但这并不重要，因为他们帮我们做了大量工作，尤其是你需要在意大利设立一两个工厂的情况下。<br>[Sylvester]: Thank you very much, Thank you. God bless you sir<br>西：非常感谢您。愿主佑你。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you enjoy your holiday, give my best regards to your beautiful wife<br>凯：谢谢。愿你有个愉快的假期，帮我想你的妻子问好。<br>[Sylvester]: thank you thank you Mr. Keshe and any time you would like to discuss just to let me know and just let me know the time<br>西：谢谢。如果您什么时候要跟我交流，请随时联系我，并告知我时间。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: you speak to your boss he is there, he is California at the moment<br>凯：你跟你的老板聊吗，他现在在加利福尼亚。<br>[Sylvester]: We talk every day, Almin is amazing… god bless you sir, happy new year<br>西：我们每天都会聊天，阿尔曼非常好，愿主佑你，新年快乐。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Keshe foundation has become a beautiful family the ones who work around the foundation’s the core, now of some 50- 60 people it is beautiful to see how they work and this is how we explain and develop the technology amongst each other. Any other question?<br>[Rick]: We got a question here is Neil from Austria he says im building at this moment the spaceship and also have one margrave running at home one thing im interested in is there a parallel to what he calls the salvica in daminhe in Italy and he says they also work with copper coils and spheres or does Mr. Keshe know about the tech nick from daminher, I checked it out in Wikipedia is actually a federation of daminheds a village in northern Italy, north of the city Turin and they have their own philosophy, sort of new age group you might say they have made tunnels and so on<br>凯：凯史基金会是一个温暖的大家庭，目前大概有五六十人在基金会内部工作，看他们如何工作是件很幸福的事情，这就是我们怎样向大家解释和发展技术的。还有其他问题吗？<br>瑞：有一个来自奥地利的尼尔，提问说我正在建造太空船，也有一个磁引力场在运行，目前遇到一个很有趣的事就是有一个类似的机构叫做salvica，他在意大利的daminhe，他说，他们也是与铜线圈和球体结构打交道的，凯史先生知道daminher的这个科技组织吗。我从维基百科搜索到它实际上是一个在daminheds的 一个联盟，位于意大利北部的一个城市，在都灵北部，他们有自己的哲学，好像是新世纪出现的一个组织，也可以说他们曾打通过隧道。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Oh yes I know them yes I know them I’ve been to the place<br>凯：对，我知道他们，我曾经去过那里。<br>[Rick]: There are named after the Egyptian city of daminhe which is the site of the temple dedicated to horrors so on and they have the underground facilities that they’ve created and beautiful structures in this kind of thing but apparently these units.<br>瑞：他们是以一个叫daminhe的埃及城市命名的，daminhe是供奉鬼的寺庙，他们建造了地下设施和一些玄妙的结构，不过也就是这些装置。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think their boss is called the crawl or something like that. I went a couple of years ago I know what is I can’t remember names but they actually change a law in Italy for them. What happened they went through the same phrase we did ,and the enemy is the guy who actually want to destroy them help them. Story behind is and stay they built underground caves to make temples, the gorgeous temples and one of the guys crawls to the top man about 15-20 years ago, what happened 15 years ago, exactly what we have with the circle. He went to and because building caves and living on the caves underground was illegal. you cannot do this it’s absolutely illegal. So he went and he asked for 1,000,000 , 2000000 otherwise I’m going to tell the government you are doing illegal activities here and the guys said do whatever you like, so his name is Fargon the bus I met him a very nice guy I had lunch with then when we stayed there with my oldest son. they invited us there a couple of years ago and what happened he went to the police and when the cavalry and the police came to these caves, the top of the police said I am not touching just so beautiful so much energyhas been put into this, to be done.  he actually helped the group to make it legal to have such a place in Italy. So the enemy trying to destroy they made the law, they made the law in the government in Italy that they could keep it and actullay pretty gorgeous the place we have been, the ones who damage people who do beautiful jobs get damaged by themselves and yes I know them and we have i know we have nothing to do with them. they have the structural work their own supermarkets, their own ideas about what they do and psychologically and emotionally and socially I don’t agree with such a structure<br>凯：我想他们的领导人好像被称为爬行者或类似的东西。几年前我就去过，只是我不记得名字了，但他们实际上改变了意大利法律对他们的限制。他们经历了和我们同样的阶段，而那些敌人其实就是想破坏他们反而帮了他们。他们发迹于其建造的地下洞穴，将其作为精致的寺庙，大概在15或20年前，其中一个人爬到头号人物的位置，15年前，他们做的正是我们目前经历的。因为建造洞穴，在地下洞穴生活是非法的，他们不能这样做，这绝对是非法的。因此，他索要1000000，2000000欧元（封口费），否则我就告诉政府，你们在这里从事非法活动，他们说随便你怎样，他的名字是fargon，我曾在公共汽车上遇见他，他是一个很好的人，在那里时，我和我的长子和他们一起吃午饭，几年前，他们曾邀请我们。他后来进了警察局，当骑兵和警察来到这些洞穴时，当时警察局局长说我没见过这么美的地方，一定花费了很多精力，他真的帮助这个组织使这些洞穴在意大利合法化。反对者试图摧毁政府通过的法令，法令是他们可以继续保留这些漂亮的洞穴，所以那些伤害从事有意义的工作的人，反而伤害了自己。我知道这些人，我知道他们和我们没有任何关系，他们有系统化的工作，有自己的超市，有自己的想法，对于他们所做的，无论从心理、情感还是社会层面，我都不同意这种结构。<br>[Rick]: Apparently they have some devices that might be similar like<br>瑞：显然，他们和我们有相似的装置。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: That’s why they invited us, they wanted to see if we can help them so I know you are talking about. They wanted to set up a company with us to use it, I think very nice people, extremely nice people but no they don’t have a technology which is working, I know they have scientific people they are working there they are very self-sufficient and they use as a tourist place, I know who you are talking about no<br>凯：这就是他们为什么会邀请我们，因为他们想看看我们是否能够帮助他们，所以我能明白你在说什么。他们想和我们建立一个公司，他们是一群很友好的人，但不行，他们的技术无法运转，我知道他们有科学家在那里工作，自给自足，他们把那些洞穴作为旅游地，我知道你们谈论的是谁，但不行。<br>[Rick]: okay good thank you for that answer we have a hard question from Abby joe i know you probably want to wrap things here Mr Keshe or should keep going for a while how are you<br>瑞：好，谢谢您的答案。这里有个艾碧乔的人提出一个问题，凯史先生，我刚才看见您在收拾东西，那我们要不要再延长一会儿，您觉得怎么样？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I have no problem<br>凯：行，没问题。<br>[Rick]: do need a minute there, we can almost see your phone on in the video so if you want pull it away a little bit from the video<br>瑞：您要不要等一下，我看见您的手机在镜头里，要不要把它放在一边。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: okay<br>凯：好的。<br>[Rick]: Mr. Keshe pull your phone back from the video there I have to so<br>瑞：凯史先生，请把您的手机放在一边吧，我要…<br>[Mr Keshe]: Sorry I have to send something out.It has to be.. The process of teaching from now will very interesting but i wanted to tell you what i am waiting. I am  waiting for a friend to come in. He  is a dr. and i delayed this part of teaching because he asked me he going to come here. I am waiting for him and then I will open a new insights into the medical application. In the last night opening of the, what we call ,the French Keshe foundation section of Canada, the I explained to them today, I will disclose this technic of the health but I’m just waiting for this gentleman to arrive, I respect him highly a medical man, man of medicine he is coming to be with us and then he wanted to be here when I explained this you, we can’t extend it by one hour but it would be really important for the health application, we are getting a lot of support from the medical world, we are probably doing what they see and it’s a pleasure to have them sometimes with us. Let me explain in the process of understanding the structure if we if you look at the system ,we need to go back on understanding the work of the structure, in being able to see the work of the structure, in being able to feel the work of the structure, you have to extend the limits of the knowledge ,and the limits of understanding in a way that so you can utilize all the forces<br>凯：抱歉，我要发一些东西。教学的过程是非常有趣的，我要跟你们说，我现在正在等一个医生朋友，之所以会延迟这部分教学工作，是因为他说要来这里，我在等他，然后再向大家介绍一个新的医疗应用。在昨晚法国凯史基金会加拿大分会的开幕式上，我向他们宣布今天将公布这项健康技术，我现在正在等这位绅士到达，我非常敬重他，他是位医学家，他很快就会来，当我介绍这项技术的时候，他希望在场，但我们不能再延长一小时，不过对于这项医疗应用是非常重要的，我们从医学界得到很多支持，我们很可能在做他们看到的，很高兴有他们有时能加入到我们的工作中。让我解释下如何理解这个结构，如果你看到这个系统，我们需要重新理解这个结构，感受这个结构的工作过程，你必须扩大对知识的理解限度，从而你们能够充分利用所有可用的力量。<br>[Rick]: Hello?<br>瑞：您在么，凯史先生？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: extract<br>凯：提取。<br>[Rick]: we just missed a couple of words there Mr. Keshe its okay now<br>瑞：您刚才说的话，我们没有听清，现在好了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It means how to extract or how to inject into the system. what you need and what you want to take out .this system can be anything ,it can be a power supply, it can be the human body, it can be ,just one second, what comes and what can be the process within the structure of the body of man. just one second, or what it comes and what is important is that we understand if we take the essence of entity away, we can do anything we like. what is important is that we can do the same thing with the body of the man.<br>凯：就是怎样从这个系统中提取或是注入系统，你需要什么，你要取出什么东西，这个系统可能是任何事物，可能是电池，人体，稍等一下，都有什么，在人体结构中会有什么，再等一下，它会成为什么样子，什么才是重要的，这些我们都要了解。如果我们可以从一个实体中提取任何东西，我们就可以做我们想做的事。重要的是，我们可以用人体做同样的事。<br>If you take the body of the man and does not that of what you put on it ，legs arms or head， there is only one of the body of the man which is mouldable and can be manipulated and more or less this is the human body part. the brain section you manipulated by the plasma but the body of the man you manipulated with the matter of the plasma, where the emotional part does not work that way. One of the problems which we have seen and one of the problems which is at the moment ongoing is ,just one second, for example in the heart of the man when you have a valve or you have a blood vessels blocked, be go for an open operation we call them open heart surgeries .we need to change a valve, we need to what we called the bypass ,we take a peace from one and attach to it to allow the system to regenerate or at least to work.<br>如果你用人体作为对象，无论你放上什么，腿、胳膊或者头，人的身体是可塑、可操控的，这个就是人体，大脑由等离子体控制，而身体由等离子体物质控制，情感功能不是这样工作的，我们目前遇到了一个问题，等一下，例如，当心脏（中间画了一个圆圈）的瓣膜或者心血管阻塞，就需要做开腔手术，然后换一个瓣膜，需要搭桥手术，从另一部分取下一块接到这部分上，从而使得系统再生或至少重新工作。<br> There is new alternative way and this alternative way is very simple .this has to be done by the man of medicine and in a very rapid way ,we can explain to you how he can do it how it can be done but those our physicians who understand the process .our friend has arrived he is sitting next to me, so I can teach easy. the process is simple, we have seen these systems,now we will be going to see what we thought about the energy and the production of the spaceship, is how to use the same core system in building blocks of the body of man, how you can do the same thing without actually doing a single open-heart surgery, you can literally destroy cancer with the same process. If you have a cancer if you have any kind of what I call repair you need to kidneys, to liver ,without opening the body of the man. You will be kicking yourself but it is good to kick.<br>现在有了其他方案，而这种方案非常简单。此方案需要医生来操作，很快，我就会向你们解释他是怎么做到的，这个过程具体是怎样的，不过现在了解这个过程的医生，也就是我的朋友来了，他就坐在我身边，这样会更容易教大家。这个过程很简单，你们都见过这些结构，我们现在要想一下能量的产生，和飞船的制造过程，也就是怎样用同样的核心系统构建人体各个部位，怎样用同样的工具，不用做开腔手术，就能完成这个过程，理论上，这和摘瘤手术是一样的。如果你有肿瘤，无论是在肾脏还是在肝上，怎样做不用把身体剖开，就能修复。这将犹如醍醐灌顶。<br>Let’s say this is the body of the man. If this is the body of the man and somewhere here is a heart of the man or the cancer point. All of you have seen this pen, you all made it and in about two weeks’ time 3 weeks’ time you can buy from the Keshe foundation health certification from the EU. And all of you have seen our old friend the coil. The disease of the man is connected with his emotional physicality, if you have ,let’s say ,the man with the heart problem ,you can point the system at a point of where you want to change the heart valve where you want to change, all you need to know you need to point ,if i can put it on the direction where you see the point ,you encircle the gravitational ,the emotional part of the organ and with the outer ring you connect the physicality change.<br>来看一下，（用一个瓶子代替）这是我们的人体，这里就是心脏(手所指），或者肿瘤，你们都见过这支笔，也都自己做过，再有两到三周，你们就能从凯史基金会医疗机构购买，你们也都见到过我们的老朋友，线圈。人类的疾病与其心理状态有着密切联系，如果一个人的心脏有问题，你就可以指出这个系统中你想更换的心脏瓣膜，你要知道要指出瓣膜的位置，如果这支笔可以在上面指方向，你们就可以看到这个点，你用围绕成引力线圈也就是器官的情感供能，外部的环是与肉体变换相连接。<br> Very easy when you place it on the position of the change and you will find on you can’t point between 1 to 3 pens in the position of the valve or as you want to change the hearts vessels in opening up regenerating . you can do it and by holding and within minutes removing it and repeating the same operation over and over.<br>这很简单，如果你把它放在需要改变的地方，你就会发现你无法用1到3 支笔在瓣膜中标出位置，或是在解剖再生手术中改变心血管，你可以在拿着的几分钟内移动它或者不断重复这个手术。<br>The heart cells will rebuild themselves and you don’t need to do any operation or any open surgery ,the same with a cancer. If you have a cancer lump even in the breast you can position the system on the back of the body or on the breast and by pointing the system your pen you change the emotion and the physicality of the cancer and you will find out within seconds the whole operation starts reverse.<br>心脏中的细胞会不断再造，这样你就不需要做任何手术，摘除肿瘤也是这样，如果癌症肿瘤长在胸上，可以把这个系统放在人体背后或是直接在胸上，用笔标出这个系统，你就会改变肿瘤的情感和肉体性，很快你就会发现整个手术开始逆转。<br>In a space don’t need to carry any medicine, so easy. So if you are physicians I know a large number of doctors listen, you can to start testing with the coils with your patients combination off the pen, The pen directs the position, the coil covers the totality of the environment in comparison, so if you have a cancer point, if i can find something here , if you have a cancer point in the centre ,then this compares with the totality of the area and this converts the totality .the strength of the pen you make dictates the depth where he has to operate, you can move the pen in a given position to reach the points where you find to work. if there is no difference if there is no problem ,that is no need for change you can make pens in a way that it only affect the tissue muscle of a given strength. This is what you physicians have to develop and the research centre will develop further where you will decide in change of character emotionally and physically and disappearance of the diseases.<br>在空间中，不需要任何药物，操作简单。如果你是医生，我知道很多医生现在在看视频，你可以与病人一起用线圈和这种笔来测试。笔来控制方向，相比之下，线圈覆盖整个环境，那么如果你有癌症，我从这里拿一些东西，如果在中间有肿瘤，如果这个线圈代替这整个区域，这支笔就能转换整个环境，笔的能量决定了病人做手术的深度，你可以在给定的位置移动笔从而到达理想的位置，如果这没有任何差别或是问题，就没有必要去改变，你就只是利用它的影响组织肌肉的一个限定的磁场强度。这就是医生要做的，也是研究机构要进一步研究的，你决定情感特征和物理特征的改变从而摆脱疾病。<br>If you understand what you do with these coils you can make two different sides of coils, a bigger coil and a smaller coil and cover cancers which are spread. so you put one in the back and one in the front, the body of the man sits between the coils and this way you can go through every single structure, but you got to make sure that you do not or you understand how you have nano coated the gans. This is important ,do not use random gans ,you have to use CH3 or CuO or cu2 or co2. You have to understand what was the cause of the emotion, you can change and reduce brain tumours in no time using this technology. Let the physician test and tell us. We set the guidelines ,we set the procedure, what you do all you need  especially for emotional diseases cancers you need the head to be at a point of the emotion in the centre between the two ,exactly where your 2 ears sit.<br>如果你知道该怎么使用这些线圈，你就可以做两种不同的线圈，大线圈和小线圈，从而覆盖癌细胞扩散的区域，这样，你可以把一个线圈放在后面，一个放在前面（用手表示），人体夹在线圈中间，这样你就可以仔细检查每个部位，但你要确保怎样为甘斯加上纳米涂层，这很重要，不要随便用甘斯，你要用CH3或者氧化铜，抑或铜或二氧化碳，你要知道（引起疾病的）情感的原因，这样你就可以通过使用这项技术迅速改变或减小脑部肿瘤。让医生们做完实验后再告诉我们结果吧。我们为你提供了参考，设定了整个过程，尤其是对于精神性疾病或癌症，你所要做的便是让头部这个控制情感的部位，放在两个线圈中间，两个线圈所在的位置恰好是耳朵所在的地方。<br>The shape of your ears if you precisely inside ,is not much from these 2 .what you hear which causes the change of emotion, the words ,the beats. What you see the two eyes focus to the same centre ,then you understand why you need this confirmation of the shape of emotion and physicality ,the emotion of one side changing the physicality of the other, but don’t forget that inside each is both gravitational and magnetic. cancer should not take more than a few minutes.<br>如果你仔细向里面观察，你会发现耳朵的构造与这两种东西并无异样，你听到的讲话、声响，都会影响情绪。你的眼睛盯在中心看到的东西就能让你明白为什么要这种情绪和肉体的结构，因为情绪的变化会影响身体的变化，但不要忘记每个其中（指内圈）都有引力和磁力，治疗肿瘤也不会花费很多时间。<br>Understanding the cancer itself means a higher-level energy in comparison to the rest of the environment of the body of the man, when you have a cancer you have the amino acids, if you add a calcium to it we were discussing the other night. So now they have a heavier gravitational magnetic field so it absorbs people of the calcium a stronger fields. Now this is heavier compared to its environment and it starts putting more and more field to itself so and the two margraves.<br>要知道肿瘤本身与身体的其他部位相比意味着需要更多能量，当你体内有肿瘤时，就会有氨基酸，再加上钙，这个是我们之前讨论过的，那么这就会有一个比较重的磁引力场，它会吸收人体内的钙，从而磁场变得更强（笔所指），此时，与周围身体环境相比，它会有更多的磁场，以及两个磁引力场。<br>All you need to do is to place a system which is in balance and then you find out the 2 dissolve in its own environment in a way it releases its energy and when this energy has no physical entity.<br>那么，你所需的便是放一个稳定的系统，随后你便发现两个磁引力场在其环境中消失（消解)，在此过程中，（癌症的磁场）会释放能量直到不带有任何物质形式（癌症消失）。<br>So now we go a step further than the pens. If you structure them right way and the coils you structured them the right way are tools to eradicate any diseases on this planet. Even disinfecting waters when you walk into the infected waters. The water ,the system will change itself without any changes. Don’t forget here we have been in using electric current now using the new plasma batteries which I explain today ,you have no interaction with the matter vibration. you work in the plasma state and this way you cover as I explain the totality of the spectrum of the plasma from high power to the matter state.<br>那么我们现在就从笔再往前进一步，如果你能正确的创建这个笔结构，线圈结构也完全正确，那么这种工具就能消灭地球上的疾病。当你进入污染水源中，也能对其进行消毒，水，整个系统都会在其内部发生改变，对周围环境没有任何影响。别忘了，我们曾使用电流，但现在在这我们用的是今天给大家讲的等离子电池，这与物质振动没有发生任何相互作用，一切都在等离子环境下进行，这种方式包含了从高能量态到物质形态的等离子体的整个频谱。<br>So because there is higher power ,the matter state decreases germs cannot exist. these kind of systems are what the best disinfectants you ever find. if you can manage to produce the plasma of the batteries. A lot of problems in the health section as I  said in 2016 we are going to change the whole course you have seen the introduction of the new batteries.,More powerful batteries .the introduction of the new space technology in spaceship, now as usual we covered the health aspects which is now you can directly control the position of the cancer, you can energize it in a way that it receives so much energy in comparison to his environment becomes balance with itself and what we have seen within the first 10 minutes the first steps will start.<br>那么，由于这边的高能量，整个物质形态都会减弱，病菌无法生存，如果你能制造完全的等离子电池，那么这种系统就是目前最好的消毒方式。如我所述，2016年我们会遇到很多医疗健康方面的问题，不过我们正在改变整个进程，此前已经介绍了新型更强大的电池，介绍了太空船中涉及到的新的空间技术，同样的，我们也介绍了医疗卫生新技术，你可以直接控制肿瘤的位置，为其提供能量（提高癌症的能量频谱使其物理形态消失），从而与周围环境相比，保持其内部结构的平衡。正如我们开头十分钟看到的，现在我们要开始迈出第一步。<br>[Rick]: Mr Keshe in the spaceship environment ,where these fields will be prevalent, will there be a natural healing facility by that by being in that environment.<br>瑞：凯史先生，在太空环境中，这些磁场是普遍的吗？在这种环境中，会存在一种天然治愈机制吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what you mean?<br>凯：你说的是什么意思？<br>[Rick]: i mean if the positioning system is using fields and part of it might have auxiliary power units that might help gans and so on in the various sorts, those fields would be going on all the time creating a healthy environment for people or they still have to have particular issues addressed<br>瑞：我的意思是如果定位系统利用磁场，其中一部分可能有辅助动力装置可以为甘斯等其他物质助力，这些磁场就会一直为人们创造一个健康的环境，还是人们仍需一些特殊的要素。<br>[Mr Keshe]: Yes in a way because you don’t half of our problem comes from the interaction with our environment right most of the diseases, comes from you are environmental interactions while this creates a controlled balance you don’t have half of the problems you see at the moment in our society<br>凯：是的，在某种程度上，因为有一半的问题来自我们与环境的相互作用，大部分的疾病都源于人与环境的相互作用，而这创造了一个已控的平衡状态，在当今社会中你现在遇到的问题只是其中一半。<br>[Rick]: right this ties in Debbie Joe’s question is to bring up which is how are we going to travel inside the spaceship in the matter form, bodily form or plasma form and how is this ship insulated for matter in body if we are travelling in plasma form.<br>瑞：这就是乔戴比提出的问题有关，我们是在物质状态下还是身体形态还是等离子状态进行太空游览，以及如果我们以等离子形式游览，那么怎样实现太空船内部与物质身体的绝缘。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It’s very simple you create a given condition and that given condition is sacrosanct it will not change. The given condition dictates the whole psychological and physical condition of the body of the man. Don’t forget that as we thought in the past ,as you enter new environments of  some  different strength the space doesn’t have a continuous field strength because of the structure which you built ,the environment can changes the structure so you don’t have a physical structure made of aluminium that you are fixed with .because you can change the combination of the reactors in the creation of the matter states ,three layers of skin of the man as I always explain ,then you change into the higher strength in the field, if this is 10 to the power of 10 and this is 10 to the power of 12 by changing the fields in your reactors you go 10 to the power of 14 ,so now you’re stronger than your environment and sequentially your plasma because your body is made of gans ,moves into the same level because you’re part of the content of it, this is how it works and I think in the maybe you were present in the tests was done a couple of days ago,where we saw the people moving and they were explaining to us about the plasma that the room look like a plasmatic bluish colour, this has changed the people too .we change according to the strength of the environment, because we still exist within it. With only part half of your ear behind or one of your legs<br>凯：这很简单，你创建一个给定的条件，其神圣不可侵犯，不容改变，它也决定了人体整个心理和身体状况。不要忘了，我们以前猜想当你进入一个新环境中，而其中的场强度是与周围环境不同的，因为在太空中没有持续的场强度，因为你创造了这个系统结构，因此新环境便可以改变这个结构，那么就没有固定的铝制物理结构，因为在创造物质形态时，你会改变反应器组合。如我所说，比如人的三层皮肤，当人转变进入更高强度的磁场，如果这是10等于能量的10，这里10等价于能量12（新环境中原来10就等于12），通过改变反应器磁场，10就变为能量14，所以现在你比环境更强大，相应地，由于你的身体由甘斯构成，那么你的等离子体也会达到相同水平，因为你是系统的一部分，这就是这个系统如何工作的，我想可能你在前几天进行的实验，有人来给我们讲由于等离子，整个房间看起来都是等离子蓝，这也改变了这些人，我们随着环境强度改变，因为我们仍在环境中生存，只有一只耳朵在后面或一条腿（在后面）。<br>[Rick]: that brings up a question that i have in terms of what you were just speaking of ,what you are just saying. It makes sense to me that when these fields are increased ,that the gans within our body and the nano materials between gans and nano material that pretty much makes up our whole body , what about people that might have I don’t know titanium pins in their body or in the case of most people we have fillings in our teeth, we got these you know of mercury fillings 瑞：针对您刚才讲的，我想到一个问题。我想，当这些磁场不断增加，在人体内的甘斯和纳米材料之间，这几乎占据人的整个身体，如果人体内有钛钉，或出现一部分人会补牙的情况，然后在补牙中就会含汞。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: when this goes back to what we always discuss because what enter your mouth on the enters your body is in a gans state environment you are already in that structure is like the copper in the your nano coated in a gans of your batteries still carries itself<br>Actually even though it gives the shape but itself has become part of the stronger fields on this plasma<br>凯：这就回到我们一直在讨论的问题上，因为进入口中的就进入了你体内，在甘斯状态的环境中，人已经成为环境的一部分，就像等离子电池中甘斯里的纳米涂层铜线圈，它仍然具有本质属性。实际上，即使它构建了系统，但它本身已成为更强的等离子磁场的一部分。<br>[Rick]: so as its part of our own entity and our fillings wouldn’t get ripped out or something like that in that case<br>瑞：这样的话，就是作为身体的一部分，这些填充物不会被撕开或是怎样。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  I don’t think so we have seen happen up to now. I don’t think it will happen tomorrow<br>凯：不。我觉得不会，我们现在看过发生的现象，明天也会是这样。<br>[Rick]: I wondered people would have to have their fillings removed in order to be on the spaceship that could be a big concern.<br>瑞：我有一个疑问，为了进入太空船，人们要不要把这些填充物取出。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Some of the, but I don’t think so, there is no difference in the environment of the presence when you are in the spaceship because you created the environment you are part of it and you adapt to it, it’s not like pressure and temperature of the federal<br>凯：可能有些吧，但我不这么认为，太空船中的环境和我们现在所处的环境并无异样，因为是你创造了环境，你是其中一部分，也要去适应，这不像压力或者温度之类的。<br>[Rick]: Someone has got a question for you.Safano says good morning,Mr.Keshe, to what extent can one rely just on his own body as a margrave power unit after a correct quote inside job,<br>瑞：有人提出了一个问题。赛凡农向您问好，他说在对内部身体机能的正确调校（或引导）后，究竟要达到哪种程度才能使人类能够依赖自身，从而作为一个磁引力场装置来运行（把身体达到作为磁引力场装置运行的程度）。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: Can you explain<br>凯：能解释一下吗？<br>[Rick]: i think what he’s trying to say is… I think that’s the part of what he says and  then used to say that he calls an inside job when one makes changes inside oneself ,in order to connect with the emotional part and that the soul and so on and So Sifano indicating that if you do a correct inside a job on yourself to do to correct yourself<br>瑞：我想他想说的是…那是他讲话内容的一部分，当他体内产生改变时，他就在体内构建一个身体工作单位，这是为了实现肉体与情感和灵魂连接的目的，因而赛凡诺想说，如果你纠正了身体内部机能的运行，那么你就改善了你自己。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Let me go back to something before I forget, I have seen a lot people saying that these pens need right emotion and  right feeling and that if it’s not right it doesn’t work. First of all one of the principal things to do when you’re using the system。 You  cannot hold your own pen to heal yourself, that’s fundamental. if you have a pain in the arm ,you can take, you can do it but to find out the efficiency is not there .because, now if you look you’re part of the same circuit and this  circuit you are part of the main problem to start with.<br>凯：让我回到之前忘记讲的内容，我看到很多人说，这些笔需要正确的情感表达和感觉，如果不是正确的，那它就不能工作。首先，当你使用这个系统的时候，你不能用自己的笔来治愈自己，这是最根本的，如果你的手臂受伤，你可以用，你可以这样做，但这样很没效率，因为如果你看你是一个线路的一部分，那么你就是你的疾病问题的开端（所以不能自己治疗自己)。<br>You have to always find a way that the pen is not used or held by yourself. this is very important. because you are part of the problem to start with and now you’re trying to solve the problem, so your energy field ,your gravitational magnetic field is part of the balance of the equation. because the system inside radius fields out and takes fields from outside not insulated .don’t get fooled by the physicality of the plastic containing it. So always try to use the pen from another point position or not for you to be holding it.<br>你就不能自己拿着或使用这支笔，这一点很重要，因为你是问题（疾病）的一部分，现在你又在试图解决问题，你的能量场、磁引力场是反应系统维持平衡的一部分，因为系统的把磁场释放出去，而从外部引入的不是绝缘的磁场，不要被内部的等离子填充物愚弄，所以说要在另一个方向的位置点使用笔或者是你自己不要拿着它。<br>secondly is how you can dictate the direction of the position of the pen, when you’re using these pens if you hold the direct ,you have a different plasma field than when you tilting it. You can use 2 or 3 pens to the same point. The most important point to remember when you’re using these pens is and will be what and how they been the structured. A lot of people are using these pens and even coils we will start producing new coils for the health section. Now that you know what you can do with it, is how you create the material to create these pens. they tell me doesn’t matter if i have a wooden pen or a plastic pen? Not really because the fields is constant. Now you create a case limit to it .what is comes and releases.<br>其二，当你拿着笔的时候，你要怎样控制笔的方向？当你直接拿着它并稳定直指一个方向时，这样比笔倾斜拿着时就会有一个不同的等离子磁场，你可以用两三只笔共同作用同一个位置。还有比较重要的一点你要记住，当你使用这些笔的时候，要知道它的成分是什么，是怎样的结构。很多人在用这些笔或线圈，我们很快就会制造医疗方面的新型线圈。现在你知道能用它来做什么，怎样做这些材料并来制造这些笔。有人跟我说，用木质或塑料笔也没有关系，其实，并不是这样的，因为这些磁场是持续的，现在你创造的条件对它会产生什么，释放什么是有限制的。<br>This pen works like this if you look at this pen, this pen does not work like this as you think, this pen works like this. Here goes like this, so if this is a cell which is damaged, not abusing these systems understand the totality not just observe by the point what’s inside and how you done it, from tip of your pen on the top to the bottom of it, is involved in this whatever  you call, inflammation or whatever, it is not the tip only. this is very important because the field strength is different within this structure and each 1 layer carries different strength, so you work with the totality of the pen, the same with the rings, when you have the rings ,you work with the total environment which the ring creates both emotional and physical. that’s why they are so affective.<br>这支笔是像这样工作的，如果你看这支笔，它不是像你想象的这样竖直向下工作，而是向两边发散，笔尖部位也是像两边发散，因此，如果这有个细胞受损伤，不能滥用这些系统，你要理解这个整体环境而不是仅仅观察一点里面的构造，以及你是怎么做的，从笔的顶部的尖端到底部，都参与到治疗发炎中，也不只是尖端，这一点非常重要，因为系统（笔）内的磁场强度是与发炎部位的磁场强度不同的，每一层都有不同的磁场强度（笔所散发磁场的扇形区域），所以你要用整支笔工作，那些线圈也是这样，如果你用线圈，也是都要参与到整体的工作中，因为线圈能产生情感和物理上的作用，这就是为什么它会这么有影响力（有效）。<br>What you change inside, i can change the cancer point in your breast within minutes, but if in the emotional brain of the man, the cancer point has to be there to confirm the pain of the existence of what the person has been into, you find a cancer it will come back within hours. You have to sort the cause of the problem which is the emotional part ,you can use this system without touching for change off the skin of the man .I’ve shown you this before.<br>你可以改变内部的什么东西呢，可以很快改变胸上的肿瘤，如果在人脑的情感区域，肿瘤就要在那里确定人们所经受的痛苦，即使你发现了癌细胞，它在数小时内还会再生。所以你必须解决问题的根源，也就是你的情感部分，你可以使用该系统而不会改变人体皮肤。我之前向你们展示过的。<br>The worst degree burns within minutes you can start building layers, this is not hard to do even with the pens. I teach you more and more as we go into this. You can use the coils just replace 3 level coils which you have in the stacker units, have one of the best units for repair healing for any units, for change of bone fracture. if you use the coils you understand when you have your, when you make your systems, when you made your 3 stacker if you done the correct gans process you can move your hand, your arm around in different position of the stacker. to heal or to repair even injuries to animals. because the fearless strength if you make sure that there is amino acid mixture in one of your layers, you always do the same job.  the stacker unit is not just for energy and it doesn’t need the wishful thinking if you prayed to it will give it to you if your intention is right, your intention is plasmatic, so you can change anything you like by the structure which you build your systems from.<br>几分钟内，最坏的部分烧灼后，你就可以开始重建皮层，这个过程即使用笔也不会很难。在我们不断深入的过程中，我教给你们越来越多的知识。如果你用这些线圈代替能量盒中的3层线圈，你可以用能量盒中的一层线圈的来修缮任何单元，可以改变骨架。当你在创建系统时，创建能量盒时，你会用到这些线圈，如果你妥善运用合适的甘斯，当你把手或者胳膊环绕在能量盒的不同位置（三角形表示能量盒与手的相互作用），就能治愈伤口，甚至动物咬伤也可以治愈，这是由于无所畏惧的磁场力。如果你能确保能量盒的三层中（任一层）有氨基酸混合物，你就能做同样的工作。能量盒不只是供能，它不需要提出殷切的愿望，无论你是否向它祈祷，只要你的意图是好的，它都会帮助你，因为你的意图（意愿）是等离子体，所以你就可以改变任何事物通过这个你创建的结构。<br>[Rick]: Mr Keshe,could you draw what the field look like around that unit, is there an entry and exit?<br>瑞：凯史先生，您能画下这个装置周围的磁场吗，它有入口和出口吗？<br>[Keshe]:No it’s a balance. It is a total balance. you put a<br>凯：不，她就是平衡的，完全平衡。<br>[Rick]:  many people talk about a toroid being the central core shape of everything in the universe and that kind of thing .<br>瑞：很多人都在说在宇宙中，所有物质的中心结构是环面…<br>[Mr. Keshe]:no. In a way you create when you put 2 systems, if you put 2 system like double coil as you have. if you put the body of the man in between, you cover the full spectrum of what that happens in there.<br>凯：不，在某种程度上，如果你创建两个系统，就像2层线圈，然后把身体夹在中间，那么就能覆盖这里发生的整个等离子频谱。<br>We know we are all aware of a guy who was listening himself, another guy who been part of a another test where they don’t see their own hands,  they don’t see the fingers of people around it, we monitor the past few days together ,Rick and Vince, the point is that the body of the man don’t disappear that you don’t see it and go somewhere else ,the thing is the man who made the coil with the ganses he put on it, he created a gravitational magnetic fields in this core that in the strength in the given position from this setup is equal to amino acid of the skin of the man and being in balance is no interaction, there is no visibility.<br>我们都知道有一个人正在听，另一个人可能正在试验中，他们没法看见自己的手（上面画了一个方块），也不能看见周围人的手（方块上画了一道波浪），前几天，我们监督了一些测试，瑞克和文斯的测试，关键是人体并没有消失，但你却看不到，只是在某个位置。主要是当人在制作上面有甘斯的线圈时，他就在这个中心创建了一个磁引力场（涂实），在这个装置的给定位置上的磁场力和人体皮肤的氨基酸场强是一样的（黄色方块表示皮肤氨基酸磁场），而且这个磁场是平衡的，没有相互作用，不可视。<br>Now this  is what we have been teaching and now that’s what you see it physically, it is not that the hand disappears if you put a hand here and in the core which is made in the middle, in this part of the core was all by accident amino acid of the man was deposited from the setting of the coil. the fields created here will be equal to the one of the skin of the man which is a pure amino acid and then because it’s in balance there is no interaction ,there is no visibility,that ‘s why we don’t see, that’s why the guy who said he saw his hand and his wife tried it and then they panicked and the ones which we saw last week. We could see this week, we could see the lady is moving her finger and some finger you couldn’t see and you could see in some positions, its partially because of the amino acid which is used annoyingly which is a  part of the structure and the gans has mixed into the system, so it is the field interaction which is in touch on the in balance which keeps no interaction phase.<br>这就是我们教的东西，这也是物理上你能看到的。如果你把手放在这里（右边的黄色斜线表示手），你的手并没有消失，而在这个中心的这个位置（三角形内画了一个黄圈），核心的这部分（圆圈右边涂实），都是人体偶然产生的氨基酸（又涂蓝），来源于线圈的存储（人做线圈时的互动），这里创建的磁场也和人体的皮肤一样，是纯氨基酸，由于这里完全平衡，因而也没有任何相互作用，也没有任何可视性，这就是为什么为什么会看不到，也就是为什么一个人说他看到了而他妻子试图找到却没有而造成的恐慌，也就是我们上周看到的。这周我们可以发现，一个女人移动她的手指，但有一些手指你却看不到，但在某些位置你又能看到，有部分原因是被滥用的氨基酸，这是系统结构的一部分，并且和甘斯融入到这个结构中，这就是磁场的相互作用，从而在没有相互作用的阶段保持平衡。<br>In the books and in the papers I always spoke about this when the field from the source and object is off the same strength. there is no interaction between the fields to confirm the existence of  visibility according to the man. So you can disappear,(Caroline is trying to tell me something)<br>我多次在书上和杂志上提出这一点，当原始的磁场和客体磁场强度相同（下面圆点表示主源磁场，上面表示客体磁场），磁场就不会产生相互作用来实现对于人来说可视化的存。所以，你就能隐形。凯罗琳有事要告诉我。<br>we put these systems in the amputation in the open soon and this is part of the thing we can overcome. The whole process is very simple. its understanding the field interaction between two parts if you create a balanced position even with the motion, you find a balance in the motion if you put the right amount of CO2 in your structure and the mixture ,you’ll find and find peace in the total environment of the body of the man.<br>我们很快就会把这个系统应用于截肢，并公开出来，这样我们就可以克服这类难题。整个过程非常简单。你了解了两部分中间磁场的相互作用，如果你能创建一个平衡点，即使是在运动中，你也能实现平衡，如果你在系统结构中或是混合中，放置适量的二氧化碳，你就能实现人体与环境的平衡。<br>We will record more and more of these sessions and as I said we go public with it, that you  can see how you are visible there, you can stand in the middle of the triangle more or less and you’re totally invisible ,we can hear your voice, but  will not be able to see you will. You all can do what you go to do when you making your stackers. go to your Co2 boxes, go to your copper oxide boxes and if you remember the amino acid layer on the top which are saw the fat, make sure that fat becomes part of your gans material which you made your cores weight. if you think it’s too late you can still go and brush it. You can make your system invisible.   3:32:50<br>接下来，我们会记录更多这种案例，如我之前所说，我们会将它们公开，这样你就知道怎样是可视的，你就能站在三角形的中心区域，这样你就隐形了，我们能听见你的声音，却看不到你。这样，在你制作能量盒时，你就可以随意做一些事情，去二氧化碳盒子那里，或者到氧化铜盒子里，如果你知道顶层的氨基酸层也就是我们都知道的脂肪，就要确保脂肪就是你做的甘斯材料的一部分，就是甘斯为内核增加重量，如果你觉得现在晚了，那就可以继续去接触轻触它，这样你就能让你的系统隐形。</p>
<p>[Rick]: Mr Keshe under those conditions of invisibility does that  make one in effect invisible to gravity or still fully under effect of gravity. Just a minor step on the way.<br>[Rick]: 凯史先生，那些变为隐形性的条件是对重力产生作用，还是完全受重力影响。只是在这个方向的一小步而已。<br>[Mr Keshe]: You can walk out of the middle of the system and people see you,  you go back and they don’t see you<br>[Mr Keshe]: 你走出系统外部，人们可以看到你，当你返回系统中间，人们就看不到你。<br>[Rick]: but you don’t go anywhere as such at the system<br>[Rick]: 但是你不能在去其他地方的时候都像在系统中一样。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: are you were present in the test with Vince, we saw where the fingers disappeared<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 文斯做实验的时候你也在场，我们都看到手指消失的现象。<br>[Rick]: but you did mention that this shimmering effect is one and things like shaking in the past are symptoms of the next step where you might get lift or at least a reduction in the weight<br>[Rick]: 但是你确实提到一个闪光效果。之前物体晃动之类的事情是下一步的征兆，下一步可能会抬升，或者至少能减轻重量。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: That is for the system shaking and what I call gravitational shaking to get lift, so it is very simple we have seen it the people have seen it  so we want to have a look at it so the system is very simple is understanding there is no magic, you create the balanced environment you are invisible<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 这个晃动我称之为重力晃动，可以用来抬升系统。所以这是非常简单的事情。我见过这个，大家见过，所以我们都想要看一下。这个系统非常容易理解，并没有魔法，你只要建立一个平衡的环境，就可以使自己隐形。<br>[Rick]: it’s only because that gradient that were able to see things. Now in the spaceship there would be presumably the gradient otherwise everyone would be invisible or would people be invisible,<br>[Rick]: 仅是因为梯度，我们才可以看见事物。现在假设在太空船中是有梯度的，否则每个人会变成隐形的，人们会变成隐形的吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You can become invisible can create conditions of invisibility and tangibility<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 你可以隐形，可以建立隐形和有形的条件。<br>[Rick]: So in conditions in space you would probably want to be invisible to those situations<br>[Rick]: 在太空环境中,你可能想要在某种情况下隐形。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: If you want to rest in the physical manner, you rest in the non-tangible manner you will see this you will you understand this very quickly  is very much like the way you’ll have the atmosphere  we don’t see the moisture till it goes up and becomes a cloud and then it becomes apparent to us. It is the same process, how you want it, where you want it and what condition you want to create. As i said this morning I have taught you everything that you can start literally build a spaceship without the need for any power supply because I showed how to make the power supply<br>and you know how to feed yourself because you been taught enough, it just a matter to see how many of you race towards the building the structure of things don’t exist don’t look for the space ship look to suddenly see the shape of a plate, you see copper flying in the middle of the room or hanging hovering because you are not perfectionist I got you gansing yet properly so you create layers that they lead to structures that do not expect of that here or don’t be worried if you walk in the room and hit something but something wasn’t there but how come I hit it. The game is started very nicely so every single one of you even if you made the three rings a stacker now start making your 4 ringed the stacker or 5 ringed stacker and try to see how you can bring the 2 dimensional existence the way your skin is. Your skin is nothing but the mirage by the interaction of the 3 layers your stomach is the same your heart is the same. Now you can test it<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 如果你想以物理形式休息，以无形的方式休息，你看到这个就能很快理解，这和你获得大气的方式是相近的。我们看不到水气，除非它上升变成云，然后我们才能看到它。这是同样的过程。你想如何得到它，在哪里得到它，创造什么样的环境，今早我已经教给大家所有内容了，大家可以着手建造一艘太空船，不需要动力供应，因为我已经告诉大家如何完成自我供应的动力设备。<br>你们知道如何养活自己，这个我之前教过了。现在就看你们有多少人开始竞赛制造这些并不存在的结构。不要寻找太空船，你可以突然看到金属板的形状，看到铜漂浮或者悬停在屋子中间，因为你不是完美主义者。我告诉了你以合适方法获得甘斯，然后创造（能量盒）层结构，从而形成能量盒结构。不要期望这里会出现这样结构，也不要担心当你走在屋子里会被东西撞到，东西不在那里，我要如何触到它。这个比赛开始很顺利，你们如果做出了三环能量盒，现在可以开始制作四环能量盒，五环能量盒。试着是否能将这种二维存在方式（现在的能量盒）变成你皮肤存在的方式。你的皮肤是三个层次相互作用产生的景象，不是真实的。你的胃也是一样，心脏也是一样。现在你们可以测试一下。<br>[Rick]: Arthur ask if you want to cascade our margrave with the second unit  do we need to remove the five capacitor pack  Mr. Keshe said you will properly tell how to cascade<br>[Rick]: 亚瑟问您是否想要把磁引力场和第二单元串联起来。我们是否需要去掉这五个电容组。凯史先生，您要阐述如何串联吗？<br>[Mr Keshe]: No you don’t need to, if you add the split capacitor on the power supplies to your system you’ll find that your energy system will work much more efficient we going release this the coming days<br>[Mr Keshe]:不，你不需要这样做。如果把这个分离电容器放在动力供应系统之中，你会发现你的能量系统工作会更加有效率。我们会在后面几天解释。<br>[Rick]: there was a question that will that be part of the blueprint teaching<br>[Rick]: 还有一个问题是蓝图教学的一部分。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I have seen a lot of people joining the blueprint. Caroline has raised the question. The others are asking and now she asks, I will answer you in a very nice way she says what happen if we create the environment that see entities which a new environment that we haven’t seen before? Is no problem it’s like seeing a new dog or a new friend it’s all the same ( don’t worry about the communication the sign language)<br>[Mr. Keshe]:我看到有很多人都加入蓝图中。拉罗琳提出问题。其他人也有提问，现在是她提问，我会用通俗的方式来回答。她问如果创建一个我们从来没有见过的新环境会发生什么。这个没有问题。就像我们会见到新的小狗，新朋友。这些性质是一样的。（不用担心手语沟通）<br>[Robert]: Mr Keshe I have a question for the…<br>[Robert]: 凯史先生，我有一个问题关于……<br>[Mr.Keshe]: Who is speaking?<br>[Mr.Keshe]: 现在是谁在发言？<br>[Robert]: Robert from Utah<br>[Robert]:犹他州的罗伯特<br>[Mr Keshe]: Hi Robert<br>[Mr Keshe]: 你好罗伯特<br>[Robert]: Hi how are you?<br>[Robert]: 你好吗？<br>[Mr Keshe]: Not too bad<br>[Mr Keshe]: 挺好的<br>[Robert]: okay i have a question for the group that i work with that they wanted me ask says when i have assembled the capacitors i do not give meetings for resistance as shown in the videos on the you guys showed in the 91st knowledge seekers are they still working properly and i just didn’t have been a proper answer for them<br>[Robert]: 好的，我们组里有一个问题，他们想让我提问。当我组装电容器时，我没有给出第91位知识寻求者视频展示的读数。他们还在正常运转吗，我没有办法解释。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: what do you mean? What resistance?<br>[Mr.Keshe]: 你的意思是什么？什么读数？<br>[Robert]: I think what she’s talking about is in the video on the you guys showed when he put them together and have the paper in the capacitor he was getting small readings for voltage, small own readings i don’t think she gets it an own and I told her that’s probably just because her capacitor is nano coated better or<br>[Robert]: 我觉得她说的是指在你们展示的视频中，当他把电容器组装起来，在电容器里有一张纸，他得到了很小的电压读数，我觉得她不可能自己得到，可能是因为她电容器的纳米涂层更好。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It depends some of the it totally zerol and the other thing is if your capacitor is still wet<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 它决定于它是否是零，另一件事是你的电容器是否是潮湿的。<br>[Robert]: No she said that she was able to dry them completely she dried them for a good day and a half or so<br>[Robert]: 不，她说她已经把它们完全干燥，她把它们干燥了一天半，所以<br>[Mr Keshe]: No we don’t see that we see a current and a voltage. Your resistance is absolutely maximum because the its nano material<br>[Mr Keshe]: 不，我们看不到那个，我们看到了一个电流和电压。你的读数完全被放大了，因为它是纳米涂层材料。<br>[Robert]: okay great yeah that’s exactly what she wanted to know<br>[Robert]: 好的，这就是她想知道的，非常感谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: somewhere there is a short circuit.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 有的地方会有短的回路。<br>[Robert]: she’s coming up here on Thursday so i can help you with that as well so or maybe this afternoon we will get through it. Thank you Mr. Keshe<br>[Robert]: 她周四会过来，所以到时会帮她把这里解决好，可能今天下午就可以解决，谢谢你凯史先生。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: We are nearly 4 hours. Pardon<br>[Mr.Keshe]: 我们已经进行了快4个小时。麻烦你再重复一遍。<br>[Robert]: i was answering Nick’s comment i said of the only computer we have in my son’s room so i’m unable to use it at night time so i apologize<br>[Robert]: 我之前回答尼克的评论，我说我们只有一台电脑，在我儿子房间，所以我晚上不能使用。所以不好意思。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We got to get ready for a those of us who would like to enjoy the last hours of the old year.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 那么我们会为想要享受旧的一年最后时刻的人们做好准备。<br>[Rick]: Yes indeed<br>[Rick]: 当然<br>[Mr Keshe]: Thank you very much for your time and i know that next year would be totally different that this year. If you start building be careful you don’t fly with it is.<br>[Mr Keshe]: 非常感谢您，我知道明年会和今年完全不同。如果你开始建构，要注意你是不是会与它一起飞翔。<br>[Robert] Is there way we can tender these down. i don’t see a way of tendering plasma<br>[Robert] 有方式可以把这些弱化吗？我没有找到弱化等离子体的方法。<br>[Mr.Keshe]; Just Kick it, kick your whole unit your whole thing will collapse, that’s the easiest way<br>[Mr.Keshe]用腿踢，踢整个单元，它会全部崩溃，这是最简单的方法。<br>[Rick]: That your last big advice for the year is Mr.Keshe<br>[Rick]: 这是你今年最大的建议啦，凯史先生。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: All you need to do is change the environment and the system collapses<br>[Mr.Keshe]: 你需要做的是改变环境，这样系统会崩溃。<br>[Robert]: Yeah i did hear capacitors into the field  4 capacitors and some batteries into the field and that that would help with that true<br>[Robert]: 我听说过，在领域中放入电容器，四个电容器和一些电池，这样会有帮助吗？<br>[Mr.Keshe]: but i don’t know depends on how you build your systems but if you come I advise you, a lot of you will report this and you will be do it and when it happens to see you is when you find yourself encapsulated,  the only way out is change the environment to reduce not to add and only way you reduce you withdraw the gravitational field line. The three lines which you point are the bottom to connect the base.<br>[Mr.Keshe]:我不知道，这决定于你建造的系统。但是如果你想要建议，那么我认为<br>你要记录很多，要做很多。当你发现自己被包裹在中间，出来的唯一方式就是改变环境，要减少而不是添加，你的唯一途径是减少，撤销引力场线，就是指向底部与基点连接的三条线。<br>That’s the only way you can take the flow out of it because if you remember when you put the three units you created the floor so all you need to do is to break up one of the lines when it is no floor or floor changes the structure disappears and if you build the system you can’t get the structure just move these along very very little till you see the shimmering blue light which come from the interaction of the nitrogen and then move it till you see solid one side this is, I have told you this morning. Try to look to see if you don’t see what is supposed to be behind, if this is the ceiling of the room if you can’t see the ceiling it means that something is coming up move a little very very little at time till it solidifies. If what you don’t move everything at the end. When you start moving and move very little at a time one piece at a time<br>这是将能量拿出来使你摆脱出来的唯一途径。如果你还记得，当你把三个单元这样放着，就创造了一个基底，你需要打破三条线中的一条，当基底消失或改变，这个结构就消失了。如果你建立系统，却得不到这个飞船结构效果，把这些稍微移动一下（笔所指)，直到你能看到氮反应产生的蓝光，再继续移动，直到一边变得结实，今天早上我把这个告诉大家了。尝试去看(画断线），假使你看不到后面应该是什么，如果这是房间的天花板，如果你看不到天花板，这意味着一些东西将要出现。再移动很小的一下，直到它变得更加结实（指使得出现的东西更加显化）。如果你不在最后移动所有的东西，在开始移动时，要每次一点一点移。<br>[Alvin]: Mr. Keshe if we are doing in the house<br>[Alvin]:凯史先生，如果我们在房间做实验<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Good morning Alvin.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 早上好，阿尔文。<br>[Alvin]:It’s okay?<br>[Alvin]:这样可以吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Why not? just be careful the wife doesn’t kill you all Caroline says use your mobile home or the best is to use a swimming pool<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 当然可以。只是要担心不要惹怒妻子。拉罗琳说在家里使用你的麦克风，当然最好的还是使用游泳池。<br>[Alvin]: No it’s too cold.<br>[Alvin]: 不，那样太冷了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: no problem. Rick was there an earthquake yesterday when you are teaching or was it<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 没关系。昨天上课时，里克那里昨天还发生了一场地震。<br>[Rick]: Yeah right in the middle of the Keshe plasma reactor group, my group i had an earthquake the largest earthquake in this area for years and there was a 4.8 or so and it was about these 30 km away from me and a 42 km deep so is very close and it shook here for a maybe five seconds or so or are even less there is a sort of bump or thump first and then a few seconds later it shook for a few seconds like and yeah sure enough and also down in Armin’s area they had an earthquake in California about five hours before the one here apparently and the seismologists say while they are really not connected was also a 4.4 down there so there you go<br>[Rick]: 是的，在我的凯史等离子反应堆小组的正中间。我们这里有这个地区几年来最大的地震，有4.8级左右。距我有30公里，震源深42公里，离我非常近。它晃动了大概5秒钟或更短，有一些撞击声，几秒之后，又晃动了几秒，已经很长了。阿尔敏地区也有震感。在加利福尼亚的地震在这之前持续了5个小时。地震学家说它们之间没有什么联系，并且他们预测地震是在4.4级以下的，但是情况我们也看到了。<br>[Mr.Keshe]: So it was an earthquake it wasn’t just a bump<br>[Mr.Keshe]:所以这是一次地震而不是仅仅是撞击。<br>[Rick]: It and was an earthquake definitely a 4.8 a<br>[Rick]: 这是一场4.8级的地震。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Anyway happy new year to you all to everybody who believes in the paths of Christ we wish you all the best in the coming time but if you understood what we taught toady you should be all in space by the time to celebrate the Iranian new year 21st of March and a lot of you should have in next few days, i know to 2-3 people are on the verge of solidification of the plasma in the space and very soon one or two of them will show and I’m sure now you know you don’t need to have a five stacker you can build 5 rings and start with the small you don’t need to buy a 14 gauge you can start with the wire in the computer and the start building it very slowly to get the confidence and don’t be scared to show it. There are a lot of people who sits on it, like in Germany who want to see not o be done to the Germans do it that they will be their way and this belongs to humanity and not to terrorists and again we thank you for your 50 emails to the police Berlin because it helped the police to understand what is sitting on the hand of the Italians more they want to protect it more, because we create jobs.<br>[Mr. Keshe]:不管怎样，祝每一位相信耶稣的人新年快乐。希望大家万事如意。如果大家理解我今天讲的内容，你应该到在太空时候庆祝伊朗3月21号的新年。很多人应该在接下来的几天里，我知道2到3人在太空中的等离子体固态化的边缘，很快，其中的一个或两个将显示出来。我相信现在你知道你不需要有五个能量盒，你可以建立5个环，从小的开始。你不需要买一个14测量器，就可以用电脑上的电线开始，开始慢慢构建来获得信心，不要害怕表现出来。有很多人都在这个地方，就像在德国，他们想看看德国人没有做的，这将是他们的方式，这属于人类，而不是恐怖分子，我们再次感谢你的50封邮件给柏林警察，因为它帮助警察更多了解意大利人手里有什么，他们（警察）就会更多地保护它，因为我们创造就业机会。<br>So do more harm you do the better it is for us, think you’re harming but you putting us in another with people finding out that oh they are here why we dont want to use then and very soon you will understand the collaboration between the Keshe foundation and the space organization will strengthen very rapidly up to the holiday. So invite as many as you can many theme makers as bigger terrorist as you can write to all the bank tell us we laundry money because if they are laundering can we have share in the structure of the Keshe foundation manufacturing because now the profits  is very kind of coming from the banks will like to make money and as you see our bank is still running very solid now they tell us if there’s a problem somewhere, before we have to go and see if there was a problem with the payment. Now they understand, please write to as police stations as you can to as many governments and military forces this is fantastic we thank you for it. Your contributions more than you can think you<br>所以越多阻碍对我们越好，你想伤害我们，但是你让其他人发现，说：哦，他们在这里，为什么不能使用他们（指凯史基金会）呢，很快你就会明白，凯史基金会和太空组织之间的合作将很快加强直到假期。所以请你尽可能的制造主题，破坏分子你可以写信给所有的银行告我们洗钱，因为如果我们是洗钱，那我们怎样在这种基金会工厂的架构下分享资金呢？因为现在的利润是来自银行，它们（银行）想赚钱，你能看到我们的银行仍然稳定运转，现在他们告诉我们，如果有什么问题，我们可以去看付款是否有问题。现在他们明白了。请写信给警察局，因为你可以为我们联系许多政府和军事力量，这是非常棒的，我们感谢您。你的贡献超过了你们的设想。<br>[Rick]: There is no stopping it as that’s for sure Mr. Keshe, there’s no stopping it at this point this out me anymore that’s right and it not even the Keshe foundation because it is just such a massive movement all over the planet that the there’s just people are doing it and they’re inspired by the work that you’ve done so on and that’s enough to spark everything<br>[Rick]: 这没有停止，凯史先生，这一点还没有停止。恩，您说的对。这不是凯史基金会的事，这是整个星球的浩大运动。只有人们在参与，它们是被你所从事的事情激发了，这足以引发一切。<br>[Mr Keshe]: We can see the change that the beauty of its not one man they cant have us anymore we heard they threaten somebody’s family in the past 24 hours but these are all cowards these are the people who never made a single system themselves and these are the people who believe of the terrorism now they call it internet terrorism their paid well paid they have the money to buy half a million apartment is not there any more we move out. So they have to make somewhere else at least they are doing something with their bosses.<br>[Mr Keshe]: 我们可以看到变化，这种美妙没有人能带给我们。在过去的24小时，我们听到他们威胁别人的家庭，但这些都是懦夫，他们从来没有制作自身单独的系统，这些相信恐怖主义的人，现在他们称之为网络恐怖主义，他们薪酬很高，他们有钱买五十万的公寓，就是我们搬出去的已经不在那里的地方。所以他们必须在其他地方做些什么，至少跟在他们的老板后面。<br>Wish you all the best for Christmas and New Year and Christmas gone and New Year is there and hopefully we see each other next Thursday and maybe by the we might even show a flight system you never know I will not do it any more I guide and when they are there they decide they want to show. Please understand the work of the plasma nano coated material, the gans system the rings and if you decide to use it for your cancer or your loved ones understand how you doing it will do not connect to a power supply on make yourself a powerful gans battery than then everything works in the same process what happens the energy from the cancer deposited in the battery and converts it into another use you move the cancer to another position’s energy not the cancer  itself that is why we have a capacitor and a converted capacitor and a split capacitor. All the best I hope to see next year that we can breakthrough what we have been looking for.<br>祝大家圣诞快乐，新年好。辞旧迎新之际，希望我们能在下个星期四见面，也许到了那时，我们甚至可以展示一个你不知道的飞行系统，我不再做了，我只做指导，他们在的时候他们决定是否展示。请理解等离子体，理解纳米涂层材料，甘斯系统，环（线圈）的工作，如果你决定要用它来治疗癌症，或者为了你爱的人，理解你在做什么。不要连接到一个能量动力装置，你自己制作强大的甘斯电池，然后一切都以相同的过程工作。癌症中产生的能量存放在电池中，并将其转换成另一种方式使用。你将癌症的能量转换到其他地方，但不是癌症能量本身。这就是为什么我们要有一个电容器，一个转换电容器和一个分裂电容器换。我希望明年，我们可以突破我们一直在探寻的。<br>[Rick]:Thank Mr Keshe for being will guide, we can all chime in and just say happy new year is probably a good idea.<br>[Rick]:谢谢凯史先生的指导，我们都一起说新年快乐吧。<br>[All]: Happy new year<br>[All]: 新年快乐<br>[Rick]: Do we have other languages other than English that they could chime in for us<br>[Rick]: 可以用其他语言向我们说新年快乐吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Any one from China? All the best.<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 有人来自中国吗？希望一切都好。<br>[Robert]: I will be hosting the plasma meeting at 10 pm mountain standard time’s id number 619402349 if anybody he would like to go Thank you.<br>[Robert]: 我要主持标准时间十点的等离子会议，如果有人想要感谢你的话，我有一个号码619402349<br>[Mr Keshe]: All the best, see you next time. Oh Hello hi Mrs. Westinghouse<br>[Mr Keshe]: 新年好，下次见，你好威斯汀豪斯。<br>[All]: {Laughs}<br>大家笑。<br>[Rick]: We should probable end things here<br>[Rick]: 我们今天就在这里结束吧。</p>
