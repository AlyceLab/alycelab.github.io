        <p>凯史第18次国际教学<br>（2016年6月7日  星期二）<br>根据外国英语脚本摘要笔译<br>（2017年1月4日完成）</p>
<p>英语脚本：Lynn Schmaltz（林恩·施马尔茨）<br>中文笔译：一步穿锣<br>组织整理：照章行世<br>Keshe (K): We are entering in a different dimension in teaching as I was explaining to our knowledge seekers. We have found a gap in the knowledge of the use of the knowledge and this gap or this shortage or lack of understanding must be corrected and put right. Today and on Thursday we will emphasize this and bring it out; we have finished developing the foundation of the technology. What we are going to do today and next Thursday to bring the knowledge so we all understand.<br>凯史：我们的教学正在进入一个不同的次元，就像我给我们的知识寻求者解释的。我们已经在我们使用的知识中发现了一个缺口，这个认识的缺口或者缺失或者不足必须得到纠正和弥补。在今天星期四我们将强调和带来这个。我们已经完成了发展这个技术基础。今天以及下周四我们将带来这个知识，使我们都理解。</p>
<p>K: the intentional teaching next Tuesday will go from 2 to 3:30 and we finish at 3:30. After 3:30 we are teaching technology to scientists and military around the world and as part of our commitment to the nation which we will keep that way until we can bring the two sides together. We don’t have the extra time to fit in the teaching schedule. So we will switch and at 3:30 begin our teaching to the military and space teaching to the international and waiting on the language which we cover the teaching. The teaching will not be open on international lines unless we decide to do that in the next few days. We are going to open the teaching next Thursday after 3:30 to the International public.<br>凯史：下周二的国际教学将从2点到3点30，我们在3点30分结束。3点30以后我们对全世界的科学家和军事人员教授这个知识，这是我们对各个国家的承诺，我们将保持那样直到我们可以把两边带上共同的道路。我们没有更多的时间来安排教学时间表。所以我们将在3点30分切换至军事方面和太空教学正在等待国际语言（翻译）方面能够覆盖这个教学。这个教学将不会在因特网上公开，除非在接下来几天决定那么做。我们对国际的政府开放下周四3：30以后的教学。</p>
<p>K: this is important—we have started the procedure that we will carry on with the total understanding. A lot of teaching has been done and now we try to structure it and bring more information that makes it clearer. I explained before today and now that you understand—we have to go into the phase of development of the technology by its application. This means from now on we teach how to apply different type of technologies which the plasma will bring. You want to use it in the interface with the plasma fields which is very advanced or you want to work with the plasma, the GANS, the nano materials and the rest which still give you connection with the matter state. The problem or the solution sits in the same course. I will go over these today and I go over it again on Thursday until it is understood fully. (13.27 minutes)<br>凯史：这很重要—我们启动这个进程，那样我们将带来全部的理解。许多教学已经完成，现在我们尝试去构建它，带来更多的信息以使它更加清晰。今天之前我解释过，现在你明白–我们已经进入这个技术的发展阶段。这意味着从现在开始我们教授如何带来这个等离子体技术不同类型的应用。你想要在等离子场体的界面中应用它，那是非常先进的，或者你想要等离子体工作，甘斯，纳米材料以及其他等等，那样仍然是与物质状态相关。这个问题或者这个解决方法是同样的过程。今天我们将超越这些，我在星期四再次重温它直到它被完全理解。</p>
<p>K: in the GANS state or in the plasma state of the fields we sue what we don’t see. And this is part of your biggest problem. How can something which you cannot see perform? How can the fields which you cannot measure give you certain things? You have in the past few weeks and months seen the fields but you have a connection with it that makes you happy to accept the physical part of it. But if you look at your pain pens you are holding physical matter and all the work is done with the plasma. Holding the pen gives you confirmation that something is happening. It is the pen that does it? If you understood you would know it is the field plasma that is doing the job. We are receiving a huge number of reports from many people that they are using the pens for different applications such as cancer reduction, for pain in the neck, leg and back. In fact it is not the pen, but the field plasma that is doing this. So you are already familiar with the field plasma. You have gained some trust. But because you have to hold these things in your hand you have the confirmation of something to do with the matter state.<br>凯史：我们请求不要仅看到场体的甘斯状态或者等离子状态。这是你的更大问题的部分。如何能够（知道）有东西产生，因为你们不能看到它运转？如何能知道场体，因为它不能给你某种东西去测量？你在过去几周或几月你看见这个场体是由于你与它有一个连接，那使你幸福地去接受它的物质部分。如果你看你的止痛笔，你握住它的物理的物质部分，但所有的工作都是在等离子体之下的。握住笔使你确认某些事情正在发生，这是这支笔做到的吗？如果你理解你将会知道这是等离子场在工作。我们收到来自许多人的大量的报告，他们把笔进行了许多方面不同的运用，诸如肿瘤减小、脖子痛、腿痛以及背痛。事实上不是笔而是等离子场体的作用。所以你已经亲近等离子场体，你获得某种信任。但是因为你手中握着这些东西，因此你确信这些作用与这些物质状态有关。</p>
<p>K: but, in fact it is the field that comes from the pen that is producing results. Giovanni tells me that in Rome a Magrav unit built 4 months ago has been in position in a house and they have disconnect the power supply totally from the grid. And whatever is connected to the plug on the unit is working – the refrigerator, the lights, the air and whatever they plugged into after the unit was installed is working. Before the unit was plugged in nothing was working in the house. This is not the first time this is reported; we have the same report on a system installed in January and it shows zero consumption on the grid and they are using it on everything in the house. We asked for a video of this unit and hopefully we can show this on Thursday.<br>凯史：但是，事实上那是来自于笔的场体产生的结果。乔瓦尼告诉我，在罗马，一个四个月前制作安装在房子里的能量单元，他们拆除了这个房子的市电网供电端，任何插在这个单元上的电器仍然在工作—冰箱、灯、空调、无论什么只要插入这个单元后面的插座就会工作。这个单元插入之前这个房子里什么都不工作。这不是首例报告。我们还有同样的报告，一个在一月份插入的系统，他们在房子里用任何东西，电网显示都是零消耗，我们要求他们制作一个视频，有希望在这周四进行展示。</p>
<p>K: so again, this is the application of the field of the plasma. This is another one: we have seen with doctors building vertical systems with people standing, or a dog sitting, using different ways for the power of the plasma and this has shown (17.43 minutes) the same results. So we are building the trust that there is something there. Now we need to bring in, concentrate and develop the flight systems and material production system. Building this and gradually coming with something that did not exist a few months ago is a huge change for a lot of people. It’s a huge way to accept there is something like this. But in fact, it has always been and shall ever be—this is how the universe was created, out of the field of the plasma. And, this is what we did not stand still as we were busy teaching and enemies of the Keshe Foundation had a field day.<br>凯史：所以再次地，这是等离子场体的应用。这是另外一个：我们看见医生制造垂直的系统用于站立的人，或则坐着的狗，用不同的方法利用等离子体的能量，这些都表现同样的结果。所以我们在那里建立了信任，这是了不起的事情。现在我们需要去带入、聚集和发展飞行系统和造物系统。建造这些在几个月前还不存在的事物，对许多人来说这是巨大的转变。接受这些事物是巨大的挑战。但事实上，它一直存在，并且永远存在–这就是宇宙如何诞生的，出自于等离子体的场体。并且，我们不会停止，一直忙于教学，也使凯史基金会的敌人度过愉快的一天。</p>
<p>K: now they have to take their position. We announce and expose heavily the work of the people who have been working in the background to destroy the Keshe Foundation in Belgium, Germany and the United States. The Keshe foundation in the coming days will release huge amounts of information of how these organizations work to discredit the foundation. People’s understanding is simply to ask the work of the plasma so they can carry on their abuses. This time it is finished. As you all know Mr. Allan Sterling has confessed to the abuse of children, including raping his own daughters. When we exposed him last year he went on a rampage with slander and put a website against the Keshe Foundation. The case for slander against Keshe Foundation was brought. Now he will be convicted on June 17, 2016. A prison sentence of 25 to 50 years is expected and we did not make an accusation.<br>凯史：现在他们获得他们的职位。我们宣布和揭露这些人的黑暗的工作，他们在比利时、德国和美国在幕后去破坏凯史基金会。凯史基金会在接下来几天将释放大量这些人如何败坏基金会的信息。人们的理解是简单地要求等离子体的工作，所以他们可以继续他们的虐待。这是该结束的时候了。众所周知，阿兰.斯特林先生承认他对儿童的虐待，包括强奸他自己的女儿们。去年我们揭露了他，他接着就暴怒地诽谤，并推出一个网站反对凯史基金会。这种情况为凯史基金会带来诽谤和反对。现在他将在2016年6月17日被判有罪。将面临25到50年徒刑，而我们不去制造一个控告。</p>
<p>K: We collaborated with the law authorities. In America plea bargaining means that the names of the people who he has raped and those he collaborated with will not be disclosed because it is too embarrassing. We see the names of leading scientists on his collaboration against the Keshe Foundation. We saw scientists like Don Winter on his Facebook, and his peers. We saw other people appear on the list of collaborators and people who worked with Allan Sterling. These people will go out of their way to discredit the foundation so that you will not have the freedom and pleasure of what a simple technology this is. It is not for us to judge but we have seen how in the past few months, the people’s whose names we released started their opposition to the foundation creation all sorts of ‘facts’ about Keshe Foundation, Mr. Keshe, and whatever. Now we go in the correct way.<br>凯史：我们与当局法律部门合作。在美国，认罪求情协议意味着这个人的名字和他犯下的强奸罪行将不会被公开，因为那太令人尴尬。我们看到他领导的与他合作反对凯史基金会的科学家的名字。我们看见一些科学家的名字像温特（冬天）阁下在这个脸书上，还有他的同事，我们也看见其他人出现在这个合作名单上，他们与阿兰.斯特林一起工作。这些人用尽手段让基金会丢脸，那么你将不会拥有这个简单的技术给你们带来的自由和快乐。我们不是去审判，但是我们会看到过去几个月，这些人他们的名字，我们开始释放他们反对基金会的各种各样的“事实”，针对凯史基金会、凯史先生或者无论什么。现在我们回到正确的道路。</p>
<p>K: we are releasing the name of the victims. If you want to and you are the mother of a daughter or son who has been abused or gone missing, please go on these websites that are organized by others and has nothing to do with the work of the foundation, in order to bring the information out in the public regarding those who have worked against the foundation. Red Circle is the same; since we announced that he raped his own daughters he has started releasing ‘facts’ about Keshe Foundation. We were correct about Allan Sterling and we are correct about Red Circle. Don’t forget the collaboration came together when we exposed them. We want you , if you have children or you know people who lost their children, have children who have gone missing or were sexually abused go on the sites that are being set up by the Keshe Foundation supporters to release the names. We are asking Red Circle to tell us where the children are buried that you abused. That is why. The same denial that Allan Sterling made that this was slander and now we see there were over 50 children raped in the United States and don’t forget he was in Belgium meeting Red Circle. So that shows the extent of the damage. We know that Red Circle has three victims and we put it out there and it is for them to answer to society and how they have been trafficking children and diverting attention from this technology with all the things they put on the internet for you to not have the freedom and pleasure of the science.<br>凯史：我们释放这些受害者的名字。如果你想要去、你是一个受虐或失踪女儿或儿子的母亲，请去上针对这些事情的组织的网站，那是与基金会的工作毫无关系的。红圈是一样的；自从我们释放了他强暴他自己的女儿的信息，他就开始释放关于凯史基金会的“事实”。关于阿兰.斯特林和红圈我们是正确的。不要忘记当我们揭露了他们，他们就一起勾结起来。我们希望你，如果你有孩子或者你知道丢失了他们的孩子的人，有失踪的孩子们或者是受到性虐待，去正在被凯史基金会的支持者们建立起来的（网址？）释放这些名字。我们要求红圈告诉我们那些被你们虐待过的孩子们被埋葬在哪里。这就是为什么。同时拒绝阿兰.斯特林制造的（谣言），这是一个诽谤者，现在我们看到在美国有超过50个儿童被虐待，不要忘记，他是在比利时会见红圈的。所以那显示这个伤害的程度和范围。我们知道那个红圈有三个受害者，我们把它指出来，它回答（证明？）了他们的交往以及非法贩卖儿童的交易，以及他们如何分散你们对这个技术的所有事情的关注，他们把它放到网上，以使你们不能拥有自由和对这个科学的希望。</p>
<p>K: they managed to silence it for ten years in Belgium. Now it is not in Belgium anymore. Now we know how they operate and we know how the discouraging the technology has taken place in the past 15 years by Red Circle. Now he has to name his daughters. They have to be tested to see if we were correct as we were in the case of Allen Sterling. It is very easy; the problem is by distraction they have done whatever they like. Now we are the bringing concentration back to the work and you have to understand how the job was done. Mr. Allan Sterling brought out information that the Magrav system was fake and was not free energy and other allegations. A lot of people went to read it and they brought their children with them for him to abuse. Now they see that we were correct and they understand when we exposed Allan Sterling the first support for Allen Sterling came from Red Circle because he was brought in to the Keshe Foundation for interview by the Red Circle. It was all well planned.<br>凯史：在比利时，他们用十年来努力压制它。现在它再也不在比利时。现在我们知道他们如何运作，这个技术如何在过去15年使红圈感到沮丧。现在他不得不面对他的女儿们的名字，看到这些对他们是考验，如果对阿兰.斯特林我们是正确的话。这非常容易；无论他们做什么他们爱好的事情，这个麻烦都会使它们心烦意乱。现在我们把注意力集中到这个工作,你必须了解工作怎样完成。阿兰.斯特林先生提出能量系统是伪造和没有自由能源以及其他一些指控信息。许多人去阅读它，他们把他们的孩子带去供他们虐待。现在他们看到我们是正确的，他们知道当我们揭露阿兰. 斯特林，第一个支持阿兰斯特林的来自红圈，因为他是由红圈带来进入凯史基金会的，它有周详的计划。</p>
<p>K: now we directly announce: the two daughters of the Red Circle have been raped by him (Red Circle) just as Allen Sterling did to his daughters. And, we have witnesses to kissing in the gardens here and there because it was normal to them to abuse children. They distracted the technology. Now we bring everything in and do not be fooled by the others. The investigation around the Keshe Foundation and these others is getting so intense that very soon we expect Red Circle to spend 25 to 50 years in international prison. Because in the country he is paid by the paymaster.<br>凯史：现在我们直接宣布：红圈的两个女儿已经被他（红圈）强暴，正像阿兰.斯特林对待他自己的女儿们。我们有他在花园各处接吻的目击证人，因为它虐待儿童是正常的。他们对这个技术心烦意乱。现在我们带来每件事情，不要愚弄其他人。这些围绕凯史基金会的调查，这些和那些正在紧张地进行。很快，我们预计红圈会在国际监狱里度过25—50年。因为在这个国家他是由雇主支付。</p>
<p>K: What does this have to do with us? We need to gather the knowledge that comes in and understand that the people who come in the name of Suzanne or Suzonne or False Hope, they all have the same structure. The security services are working very fast and once they are open now with Mr. Allan Sterling being incarcerated, his Facebook being opened in the public and we see who his supporters are and they are those who have been opposing the Keshe Foundation. We see a gentleman Mr. Cummerand (? 26.11 minutes)and a website called Scam Keshe Foundation. Mr. Cummerand we have spoken with your bosses; we know you are a child abuser because we have access to the medical files of the children in your company. You have been sending children documents and this is child abuse. Now you understand and this man appears at the top of the list of Mr. Allan Sterling’s Facebook—one of the favorites.<br>凯史：为什么这些与我们有关？我们需要收集这些知识以便弄明白究竟是谁以苏珊或者Suzonne或则假希望的名义在活动，他们所有人都是同一个组织。安保服务的工作很高效，一旦他们释放（这些信息）阿兰.斯特林先生将被关进监狱，他的脸书已经被公开，我们看谁是他的支持者，谁在反对凯史基金会。我们看到一位绅士Cummerand先生通过网络电话欺诈凯史基金会。Cummerand先生，我们要和你的老板通话；我们知道拟是一个虐待儿童者，因为我们可以利用在你的公司里的孩子的病历档案。你有过去派送儿童的文件，这是被摧残的儿童。现在你明白，这个名字出现在阿兰.斯特林先生的脸书名单的顶端—在一个收藏夹里面。</p>
<p>K: the opening is huge. We stayed silent but suddenly out of nowhere we see how everybody becomes a scam. By scamming they get attention; they bring children and then they do what Mr. Allan Sterling and Red Circle. On the 17th of June we will the sentence for raping his own daughters of the ages of 3 to 5 yeas. And now we see that Red Circle has done the same thing to his daughters. This is direct and we want you to list the names of children you know who have gone missing around the world which end up in the hands of Red Circle. You have to understand, they were our webmaster so they had access to everything. It was the same operation as Allan Sterling. What we have to do is start building for has been deliberately financed to discredit foundation work so it does not work. It is for you to understand how to use it and let those who ‘peddle’ continue to ‘peddle.’ Whatever they say, such as our being wrong, and then they brought down the logos to support their allies.<br>凯史：这个释放的（信息量）是巨大的。我们保持沉默，但是突然间不知道从哪儿冒出来，我们看到每个人都变成了一个骗局。骗取他们的注意力;他们带来儿童，然后做阿兰.斯特林先生和红圈所做的，在6月17号我们将宣判（他）强奸自己的女儿年龄在3–5岁。现在我们看到红圈也对他的女儿们做了同样的事情。这是亲自的。现在我们要求你列出这些孩子的名单，你知道那些在全世界失踪并结束在红圈手上的孩子的名字。你要明白，他们是我们网站的管理员，所以他们可以利用每件事情。它是同样的操作，就像阿兰.斯特林一样。我们现在要做的是开始去构建故意抹黑基金会的工作提供资助，所以它不工作。它是为了你明白如何去使用它以便那些“兜售”能够继续“兜售”。无论他们怎么说，诸如我们是错误的，然后他们去拖垮这个标志去支持他们的盟友。</p>
<p>K: now we see how correct we have been. We are as solid as ever and the teaching of the foundation is as perfect as ever and there is no more Mr. Allan Sterling to write that we are a scam. Very soon there will be no Red Circle to write ‘facts’ about the Keshe Foundation. The facts (as they exist) about Keshe Foundation and Mr. Keshe are correct and now they are on the run for their own lives. The children Red Circle raped and abused started with his own daughters. Then we will see the rest. The Paymasters are on the same payroll. This is important for us because most of the discrediting of the foundation has come through these three sources. Now one is down and in prison. He will be in solitary confinement because the others know what to do with a man who rapes his own daughters.<br>凯史：现在我们看到我们如何的正确。我们依然坚固，基金会的教学依然完美，这里没有更多的阿兰.斯特林先生去创作，我们是一样的。很快，这里将没有红圈去创作有关基金会的“事实”。事实是（如果他们存在）关于凯史基金会和凯史先生是正确的，现在他们正在为了保命而逃亡。这些被红圈强暴的孩子们，一开始是虐待自己的女儿们。然后我们将见到幸存者。这个雇主在同样的工资单上，这对我们很重要，因为很多的对基金会的破坏来自这三个方面，现在一个已经倒下在坐牢。他将被单独监禁，因为其他人知道这个男人竟然强奸自己的女儿们。</p>
<p>K: Next in line is Red Circle—the same pattern with two daughters and disappearing children. We put this on the table. We are looking for the name of the children they have raped and children who went missing and ended up in the hands of Red Circle and his team. Now you understand why there is suddenly such huge pressure to discredit me and the foundation. Now they are on the run as Mr. Allan Sterling was. Two daughters—raped, and confessed. Now there are two more daughters and maybe grandchildren. The clear indication is the foundation work is solid. Now we are looking for victims of Allan Sterling and Red Circle and his bosses. International trafficking is heavily involved and it is your job as Keshe Foundation supporters to understand that you have always been right and the technology has been right and these people have been paid to do what we are not supposed to do such as raping children.<br>凯史：下一个是红圈—同样的模式强奸了自己的两个女儿和失踪的孩子。我们把这些放到桌面上。我们寻找这些被他强暴的孩子和那些被他送到红圈和他的团队手上的失踪孩子的名字。现在你明白了为什么突然间冒出来那么多损害我和基金会名誉的事情。现在他们在逃就像阿兰.斯特林先生一样。两个女儿—强暴，已经供认的。现在有更多的女儿，也许是孙女。这清楚的显示基金会的工作是牢固的。现在我们正在寻找阿兰.斯特林和红圈以及他们的老板的受害者。这涉及严重的国际非法交易，它是你的工作，随着凯史基金会的支持者们明白你总是正确的以及这个科学技术是正确的，这些人会得到报应，我们不去猜想诸如他们如何强奸儿童。</p>
<p>K: we carry on with our work. From now on we show you our work and the application to get you the confidence in a way the technology needs to go. It’s very simple; you have seen the pen, the Magrav system and the health system. You see the energy system. Now it is for us to understand where the flight energy is. Which part of the spectrum of the field of the plasma that we need to cover and where we have missed that if this is the plasma (32.05 minutes) and this part was to do with your pen. You have to remember there is both gravitational and magnetical (when using the pen). You have seen the operation in a stronger way. This is the spectrum that the pen covers (32.40 minutes) and this is the spectrum which your medical unit covers and this is spectrum where your energy system covers and then somewhere down here there is a spectrum that you will have to find for your flight system. Understand the reason and the possibilities and understand why and then you can look for what fields you have to extend. On the pen you have concentrated on extraction and removal or mixing the energy of a given concentration point of the tissue of the man. So your field can handle the small transfers. In the section to do with the health unit you went for a mixture of multiple organs and of a given strength. Again the field works.<br>凯史：我们继续我们的工作。从现在开始我们向你们展示我们的工作和应用以获得你的信任，在某种程度上这个技术需要这么做。非常简单；你看到这个笔，能量系统和健康系统。你看到能源系统，现在它是为了让我们理解飞行的能量在哪里。那是等离子体场体的光谱的一部分，我们需要去覆盖，在那里我们错过了，如果这是等离子体，这个部分是与你的笔有关。你要记住，这是同时具有引力与磁力（当使用笔的时候），你看到的是在更为强大的方式中的运作，这是那个笔所覆盖的光谱，这也是你的医疗单元所包括的光谱，这个光谱也被你的能源系统所包含，然后在某些地方，这里或那里是同一个光谱，你会发现这也是为了你的飞行系统。理解这个原因以及可能性，理解为什么，然后你可以找到场体，你可以去扩展，在笔上面，你专注于去取出、移动或者混合人类组织中集中的某一点的能量，所以你的场体可以可以做同样的转换。片面地去运用健康单元你尽力求得器官的多重混合去给于它力量。在次地，这是场体的工作。</p>
<p>K: In the energy you went for a higher system, a higher level of frequency. In the level of the pen and the health units you are working in the GANS matter state and in the energy units you are working with the vibration of electrons. All our systems are set to (34.46 minutes). You have to understand this is the next step and the next step is that we are looking for somewhere in the region where we have the accumulation of matter and plasma magnetic fields interacting. You have worked and comfortably seen the results in your pens and in your health medical applications and the energy Magrav system and you have seen the work of the plasma. But to reach the flight condition, you have to bring the game play of the matter state and the plasma state together for this planet. Because when you enter into space this does not count unless you want to go into the state or environment where this is matter state.<br>凯史：你想得到能量的更高级的系统，更高的频率水平。在笔和健康单元的水平，你是工作在甘斯的物质状态，而能量单元你工作在电子振动水平。你的所有的系统是为了这个。你需要去理解下一步，下一步是我们要去寻找这个区域的某些地方，在那里我们有物质的积累和等离子体场体的相互作用，你们已经这么做了并且感受到使用笔和健康医疗运用以及能量单元后的舒适的结果，你看到等离子体的工作。除了达到飞行的条件，为了这个星球，你要去玩这个物质状态和等离子状态的游戏。因为当你加入到太空是没有计数的，除非你想要进入这个状态或者那里的环境也是物质状态。</p>
<p>K: Building systems and developing systems and bringing the understanding technology has past. Now it is how we can manipulate it and use different aspects of the technology and of the state of the matter plasma to the free energy plasma that can be used for the benefit of mankind. This is where we see the change. This is all in the free plasma state and I go over this over and over. We have gone over this so many times that it has inspired you to come up with new technologies and with new systems with the same proposition: understand the simple way we started with what man knew best—the matter state. Then it was the nano state and then with that we brought in GANS and liquid water and then we have come to the state of the energy of the plasma. Now you have a very big problem. You have worked from matter state to the state of energy of the plasma. Now you have to work from the energy of plasma up to the matter state. (38.08 minutes).<br>凯史：建造系统，发展系统，带来这个理解，技术已经完成。现在是我们如何能够去操控它。这是我们看到的转变的地方。用这个技术的不同的方面，等离子体物质状态，等离子体能够用来为了人类的利益去运用到自由能源方面。这是我们看到转变的地方。所有都是在自由等离子体的状态里面，我再三说这个。我们反复温习这个很多次，是为了你能够跟上这个新的技术和新的系统，同样的议题：理解这个简单的方法，我们从人类最好理解的—物质状态开始。当它是纳米状态，然后用那个我们带来甘斯和液体水，然后我们来到等离子体的能量的状态，现在你有非常大的问题。你已经从物质状态的工作来到等离子体的能量状态的工作。现在你把等离子体的能量用到物质状态。</p>
<p>K: you will find out as we saw the 129 Tesla, and we used only 12 volts, 12 watts of energy. Our colleagues went from matter state of 100 Tesla to 1.4 gig watt of energy. The 12 volt, 12 watts was done by a very simple man with a few hundred euro of material initially to achieve that. The 129 Tesla is here built by Armen. This is the 129 system (39.09 minutes). Now you understand how the 129 system works. Now you understand why the simple system by Armen made over a year ago in Sosano worked. Because he came from energy state to the matter state.<br>凯史：你将找到我们所说的129特斯拉，我们仅仅只用了12伏，12瓦的能量。我们的同事从物质状态的100特斯拉到1.4千兆瓦的能量。12伏，12瓦就简单的完成了，那个人一开始用几百欧元的材料就达到了那个。这个129特斯拉是阿曼建造的。现在你理解这个129系统是如何工作的。因为他是从能量状态到物质状态。</p>
<p>K: Now our biggest job is trying to teach you that now you have come to the plasmatic condition of the fields and how easy it will be to go from bottom to top and now you are on the top. With plasma technology you sit on the totality of energy. You sit on the structure of the technology and now you don’t need that much if you understand the work of the plasma. You don’t need to do much if we see these kinds of things on the work. You spend hundreds of thousands, millions to achieve 100 Tesla. And a single man with the knowledge of the plasma achieves more than that with a few thousand. And now that we have the knowledge a few tens of dollars.<br>凯史：现在我们最大的工作是尝试去教会你们，现在你来到场体的等离子态条件，它如何容易地从下至上，现在你在顶部。你在能量的全体性之上运用等离子体科技。你在这个技术的结构之上，现在如果你理解等离子体的工作，你不需要那么多。如果我们看到这个工作做的这种事情，你不需要更多。你耗费成千上万，数百万去达到100特斯拉。而一个单身汉只用几百元就达到甚至超过。现在我们有这个技术只需要几十美元。</p>
<p>K: you have to go back in a way and re-tune your thinking, ideas and the way you have worked. You worked from the matter state to the GANS to the plasma to the field and now you need to start working from the fields to create the energy, to create the matter state that you want and this will be fantastic. Now if you start this process you start the process of becoming the man of space. This is what you have in space; field energy is what you have in your hands in space and not matter state. Now it should be very easy to start developing whatever you need. The spaceship program is the application of the fields of the plasma of the universe. There is nowhere in the universe that is void of such a field. There is no state of pure vacuum with nothing in it in the universe because everywhere in the universe the field is going from one place to another and you are just a spectator in the gap of space in that moment and even while you are measuring it the fields go through your system.<br>凯史：你要回到一个方法里面，调整你过去的工作思路，主意和方法。你的工作要从物质状态到甘斯到等离子体到场体，现在你需要开始从场体躯创造能量，去创造物质状态，这将是奇妙的。现在如果你开始这个进程，你就开始了成为太空人类的进程。你在太空里是什么；场体能量是什么都掌握在你的手里，在太空里没有物质状态。现在它将非常容易去开始发展无论任何你所需要的。太空船项目是宇宙的等离子场的运用。在宇宙中一无所有，那里缺乏这样的场体，在宇宙中是纯粹的真空状态不符合事实，因为在宇宙中的任何地方，场体从一个地方到另外一个地方，你只是一个在壳子里的片刻的旁观者，乃至虽然你通过你的系统场体去测量它。</p>
<p>K; so, this is where the strange thing will come for you to understand and become the creators and from now on you go from matter state to exact reverse of before. When you do it this way you will see the very fundamental change. You will the very fundamental work (43.30 minutes) and that is from here, going from the weakest to strongest with using other energy fields. To go from energy fields, the strongest, to the weakest you need very little, almost zero. More or less, you need none. You have seen how it is done and you understand the process. Now we go to the technology from changing the fields of plasma and you will see how we bring fields to the matter state. You have to remember and understand the process which is absolutely fundamental and sacrosanct. The process is so easy that it can be explained in a very few lines because now you understand it all.<br>凯史：因此，这是奇怪的地方，为了使你理解和成为创造者，从现在开始，你从物质状态去到之前的精确的反面，当你用这种方法做的时候，你将看见根本的转变。你将在非常基本的原理上去工作，那就是从这里，去运用其他场体从最弱的到最强的。从能量场，最强的，到最弱的你需要很少，几乎为零。或多或少，你没有需要。你会看到它如何完成，然后你就理解这个过程。现在我们从转变等离子体的场体到这个科技，你将看到我们如何从场体到物质状态。你需要记住和理解这个过程，那是绝对的最基本的和神圣的原理。这个过程如此容易以至于它可以用很少的词来解释，因为你现在理解了它的全部。</p>
<p>K: we used in this process down (44.57 minutes) and I will give you parallels. It should be very easy for a lot of you to start working even today to complete part of the process. In the matter state we used NaOH (sodium hydroxide, or lye) to go from molecular to atomic. From atomic to the plasma we used Nacl (sodium) with the field interaction and then we used the water with it to bring the field into the homogenous level that we call the liquid plasma. And then we allowed the liquid plasma to release its energy. Now look at the way you have to work. On this planet sodium, (46.13 minutes) the base of the salts, has to be used as this is the energy of the universe and it interacts with the plasma of the field of the planet and become homogenous in the water of the oceans of this planet and the presence of the salt on the planet leads to the creation of nano-materials which leads to the creation of life.<br>凯史：我们已经使这个工作完成，我将给你相应的。它将是非常容易的，你们许多人已经开始工作，甚至今天就能这个进程的一部分。在物质状态里面，我们使用NaOH（氢氧化钠或碱液）去从分子到原子，从原子到等离子体，我们使用Nacl（氯化钠）与场体相互作用，然后我们用水把它带到与场体同质的水平，然后我们把它叫做液体等离子体。然后我们容许液体等离子体去释放它的能量。现在着眼于这个方法你去工作。在这个行星上钠，盐的基本成分，必须被使用，这是宇宙的能量，它与这颗行星的等离子体的场体相互作用，与这颗星球的许许多多的（场体强度）在水里成为同质的，在这个星球上盐的存在导致纳米材料被创造，也导致生命被创造。<br>K: now if you take your fields of plasma and subject it to the same interaction as is the matter state, put in the condition of the plasmatic water the condition of producing GANS, then nano-material then you can produce any material in any solid, liquid or nano in the universe. This is the life existence on earth. (47.35 minutes). This is the existence in the universe (47.43 minutes). Now you can replicate the same process and you will end up with any matter state you want—armenium, plutonium, amino acid, banana, if you know how to mix it. Where you started from copper, zinc, amino acid, banana and everything else, it became one. This is the change of position and the change of the direction and understanding the totality. Now you understood one side and now you have to understand the other side (from plasma to matter) and the circle is more or less complete in so many ways that you can be anywhere and when you receive what you need, you create a condition. But, don’t forget there is very big subtle difference dividing the two systems.<br>凯史：现在，如果你拿你的等离子体的场体使它去按照物质状态同样的相互作用，给它等离子态的水的条件，这个产生甘斯的条件，然后纳米材料，然后你可以在任何固体里面生产这个宇宙里的任何材料，液体或纳米的。这是地球生命的存在，也是宇宙的存在。现在你可以复制同样的过程，你将以你想要的物质状态结束—铝、钚、氨基酸、香蕉，如果你知道如何混合它的话。这里你开始于铜、锌、氨基酸，香蕉和一切别的东西，它成为一体。这是位置的转变和方向的转变，整体性的去理解。现在你已经或多或少的明白许多方面中的一个方面，你可以存在于任何地方，当你得到你所需要的，你创造一个条件。但是，不要忘记这是重大的细微不同，区分这两个系统。</p>
<p>K: on one side you use the matter state of the planet (49.12 minutes) and on the other side you have to use the plasmatic condition of the system. It is a huge difference and a huge change. the process is what you have to understand and now you can go into space and bring anything from anywhere in the universe in a field, or whenever you are in the universe and you come across solid matter you want to carry, then you convert its energy. This is important, vitally important and this is how you can become the magicians of the space technology. You become the magicians of the technology in its true essence and you start producing materials out of the fields of the universe and learning how to be able to become a man of the universe. Without the second part there is no way that you will survive as a man in the universe. It is impossible because if you do not let the universal you will be entangled in a prison of space technology that you have to create matter for every bit of food, every drop of water and every medicine. On the universal side you carry all the fields and the universe gives to you continuously and you can produce what you need, when you need it and what you want.<br>凯史：在一个方面，你使用这个行星上的物质状态，在其他方面你使用系统的等离子态的条件，它是巨大的不同和巨大的转变。你必须去理解这个进程是什么，现在你可以进入太空，从宇宙任何地方的一个场体获得任何东西。 或者任何时候你遇到固体物质，你想要携带，然后你转变它的能量，这很重要，极其重要，这是你们如何变成太空科技的魔法师，它的真实的本质是你们成为太空科技的魔法师，你开始从宇宙的场体里面生产材料，去学习如何能够成为宇宙人。你想要在这个宇宙中存活下来，没有第二个方法，那是不可能的，因为如果你不遵守宇宙的普遍法则，你将陷入一个太空科技的监狱，因为你从头至尾都在为食物去创造每一种物质、每一滴水和每一种药物。在宇宙方面，你携带所有的场体，宇宙会持续不断地供给你，你可以生产你所需要的，当你需要它，任何你想要的。</p>
<p>K: this is the change of the game for humanity to step in from the village of the earth to the universal community because if you can produce and learn to produce everything you need, nobody becomes your ‘god’ because you are the god and the creator of what you need, when you need it and where you need it. When you come into space from different races, you learn different methods of producing different things, just as the way we learn from each other. Now you see where the space technology is leading us. We came and it took man millions of years to get from the matter state to nano technology for the past 10 or 15 years, the GANS state from Keshe Foundation fro the past few months and now you have become the plasma technologists of the human race.<br>凯史：这是为了人类从地球村阶段进入宇宙社区阶段的游戏的转变，因为如果你能够生产和学习去生产你需要的所有东西，没有人成为你的“神”，因为你就是你的需求的神和造物者，当你需要它和你需要它的地方。当你从不同的种族进入到太空，你学习生产东西的不同的方法，只是就像我们互相学习的方法。现在你看到，这个太空科技在引领我们。在过去10到15年，我们已经取得人类数百万年没有明白的从物质状态到纳米技术，到甘斯状态，来自凯史基金会过去几个月的教学，现在你已经成为人类种族的等离子体技术人员。</p>
<p>K: Now you understand how you have become the ‘top dog.’ It is you who will decide the usage, the application and the next step. Understand that if you have a plasma you replicate the creation of the universe. If you want light, then look at how light is created. It is created by the interaction of the fields of one plasmatic condition, Earth, and the other plasmatic condition, the sun. We live by it—you have daylight. You want to create the state of matter, make it a faster production. Create a GANS—this how in the upper layers of earth that nitrogen and oxygen are created as a GANS and not as a matter state.<br>Then when you bring it to the near matter state, it becomes the nano of itself and then it becomes solid. So, in fact you don’t need all the matter system (the matter side), you can change in that system the gravitational magnetic field of one against the other and if you do it properly (53.50 minutes) and used in conjunction you find lift and if you use them in the proper magnetic gravitational fields you can produce water field strength and change it to a liquid in your hands and make it solid to ice or whatever. The position and the strength of the gravitational magnetical (54.10 minutes) is the condition and the process and the principle of the interaction of the fields in the universe. That way on earth condition you need huge amounts of energy to melt, to produce dream materials we cannot produce on this planet.<br>凯史：现在你明白你如何成为“优胜者”，你们谁决定使用，下一阶段的这个应用。理解如果你有等离子体你就复制了宇宙的创造。如果你想要光，就着眼于光如何被创造。它是被创造于等离子态条件的场体的相互作用，地球、和其他等离子态的条件、太阳。我们靠它而生–你就有了日光。你想要创造物质状态，使它更快地生产。创造甘斯–这就是地球大气上层的氮和氧如何产生的，如同甘斯而不是物质状态。<br>然后，当你使它接近物质状态，它变成它自己的纳米，然后它变成固体。因此，事实上你不需要所有的物质系统（物质方面），你可以在系统里面转换另一个不利的磁引力场，如果你做得正确并且协调，你会发现升力，如果你把它们用到适当的磁引力场，你可以产生水的场体强度，并且在你的手中把它转化成液体或者固体的冰或者无论什么。磁引力场的位置和强度是这个宇宙中场体互动的条件、过程和原则。这个方式在地球条件下你需要巨大的能量去融化、去生产我们不能在这个行星上生产的梦想的材料。</p>
<p>K: In the next few months you will understand it and go to the periodic table and see what the dream of man has been for the next 200 years what they call fancy elements, you produce. But don’t forget if they could be produced the gravitational field of this planet could not hold it. We don’t see it; it is there. But now you have to create the gravitational magnetic field of the environment where these materials can be shown. So you have to create two systems: 1. the system to produce the material and 2. To be able to keep the environmental magnetic gravitational field and to be able to show it. Now if you understand this plasma technology becomes the root and the essence of creation. Now you are the creator. You have to understand how you want to move, change and see it and when you want to see it. Do you want to be on the universal field energy side or on the matter state side? Or you are going from the plasma of the universe into the matter state and you want to create armenium in the environment which is in the liquid state, and you can never get it into the solid state like mercury on this planet.<br>凯史：接下来几个月你将理解它，并且在元素周期表上看到人类花费两百年的梦想他们所谓的幻想的元素，你生产。但是不要忘记，如果他们不能够制造这个星球的引力场就不能维持它，我们不能看见它，它就在这里。但是现在你去制造这个环境的磁引力场这些材料就会显现。所以，你必须去制造两个系统：1、一个系统去生产这个材料，2、另一个系统去能够维持环境的磁引力场以便能够显示它。现在，如果你明白，这个等离子技术是创造的根源和精髓。现在你就是创造者。现在你必须理解当你想要看见它的时候你如何去移动、转换和看见它。你想要去成为宇宙的场体能量的一面还是物质状态一面？或者你从宇宙的等离子体进入到物质状态，你想要去在环境中创造armenium，那是液体状态，你绝不能使它成为固体状态就像这个星球上的汞。</p>
<p>K: but you can have buildings made of stones because this is the condition and it depends on what the stone is made of. Maybe the copper in that condition does not work so well because the field strength interacts with the plasmatic gravitational magnetic field of the atomic structure of maybe one of the electrons of the copper and then you have to understand you have to protect yourself because your body, your life and your emotionality needs copper to exist so you protect yourself with a copper shield through the magnetic field. You gain is space which is so beautiful if you have the knowledge of it; if you know how to apply it and how to progress in the interaction of it. You have been looking for liquids and three conditions of the matter and energy and now you look in the essence of the energy and the essence of creation. This is what I taught in the past few days and I explained it again and then again on Thursday for those who don’t understand it.<br>凯史：但是你可以有组成建筑物的石块，因为这是条件，看是用什么石头建造的。也许铜在那个条件下工作得不是很好，因为这个场体强度与原子结构的等离子态的磁引力场的相互作用，也许是铜的一个电子，然后你要理解你必须保护自己，因为你的身体、你的生命、你的情感需要铜才能存在，所以你通过用一个铜的磁力场屏蔽去保护你自己。你获得的是太空，那是如此美丽，如果你拥有它的科技；如果你知道如何去申请它并且在与它的互动中取得进展。你必须找到液体和物质以及能量的三个条件，现在你就发现了能量的精髓和创造的精髓。这就是过去几天我教给你们的，我再三地在周四给你们那些还没有明白的人解释它。</p>
<p>K: you made the cores and the coils. (58.16 minutes) you put the GANS inside it and you added solid GANS to it. You had the water inside it and you saw the emptiness and you had the field in the center (the ‘empty space’). This is the field plasma and if you tap into that and use it in the right way and if you have a system to see it, you will see this (59.02 minutes). Because the plasma inside the empty gap is divided into layers and the way you rotate the parts in the core creates the elusive lift that you wanted. You are looking for matter state but in the world of creation and the world of the field of the plasma. You can run a reactor as small as a ping pong ball and go to the moon today. You can create areactor the size of a football <strong>__</strong> and go nowhere with it. You have to look for the intensity of the field of the center (of the ping pong ball).<br>凯史：你制造核心和线圈。你把甘斯放入它们里面，你添加固体甘斯到它里面，你有水在它里面，然后你看到空洞，你有场体在中间（“真空”）。这是等离子场体，如果你进入它用正确的方法使用它，如果你有一个系统去看见它，你将看见这个。因为等离子体在里面空洞被分离进入层里面，你在核心旋转部件的方法创建了你想要的难以捉摸的提升。你是在寻找物质状态而不是创造的世界和等离子体场体的世界。你可以旋转一个很小的反应器就像乒乓球今天去到月亮。你可以制造像足球那么大的反应堆—用它来去到无名之地。你必须去寻找中心的场体的强度（乒乓球的）。</p>
<p>K: if you look (1.00.05) the coils have layer one and layer two and the core is your third layer. You have the GANS field and the water GANS field; you already have 5 fields inside each other which are exactly like the sun plasma. Go on the internet and look; some plasma is in layers. (1.00.34 minutes) Now you see how I approach it to the point that you have the knowledge of the plasma of the universe. It is you who have to start playing with this and you have to develop the technology to play. You have to understand how you came to this point. If you look at it, it’s exactly the same and there is no difference between this here (1.01.35 minutes) and this process of the matter state as illustrated above. And the core and coil process is the plasma process of the universe. You choose each depending on where you want to go. Which way do you lead one to create the other? Once you have created the core and coil process you have created the flash that gives you the field which gives you the protection and the lift you are looking for. The tighter and stronger you pack that center point, the fast you will travel in the space of the universe.<br>凯史：如果你看这个线圈有一层和二层，这个核心是你的第三层。你有甘斯的场和液体甘斯的场；你总共有5个场体在里面，那正好像太阳等离子体，到网上去看；一些等离子体是在层里。现在你看我接近它到什么程度，你有宇宙的等离子体技术，你们开始去玩这个，你可以发展这个技术。你要去理解你们如何来到这一点。如果你看它，它是完全一样的，两者之间并没有什么不同，这个物质状态的过程上面图文并茂。这个核心和线圈作用就是宇宙等离子体的作用。你选择各自想要去哪里。可以用那个方法带领一个去创造另外一个吗？一但你创建了核心和线圈的进程，你就创建了闪光那给予你场体给你你吗在寻找的防护和飞升。你紧紧地和强烈地挤压核心点，你将很快在宇宙太空中旅行。</p>
<p>K: I’ve given you many hints and directions and told you many things, but it has all been words and now you can put the words together. The alphabet has made the words and now we start making the sentences of the universal work. You came from understanding the matter and now you can create any kind of field forces if you use and understand the work of the plasma. You are working now in your systems in the GANS systems with the central rotation and you are working exactly to the point in the fields of the universe. You are working and building the structure of a planetary system. That is what you have in there. You are not very far.<br>凯史：我给了你们很多暗示放线和方向，告诉你们很多事情，但是它们都是文字，现在你可以一起来推敲合格文字。阿尔法，贝塔组成字词，现在 我们开始制造宇宙通用的句子。你出自对物质的理解，现在你可以创造任何场体过程的种类，如果你应用和理解等离子体的工作。现在你正工作在你的系统里面，在甘斯系统与中心旋转里面，你在好工作在宇宙的场体的点上。你正在运行和建造一个行星系统的结构。那就是为什么你在这里。你离这里并不遥远。</p>
<p>K: You have the field core, the solid core the outer core (1/03.26 minutes), the magma, the solid surface. It is a copy and you have to understand this (core/coil structure) is rotating. Each of the cores in the core/coil are rotating and each one will take according the strength they have and that interaction of the strength creates the propulsion and attraction of two different fields. This is the most efficient plasmatic system for space flight, medical application, for food and for production of materials. If you understand this system, now you see you have matter to plasma and the fields have fields to plasma in the matter. The system which you carry in front of you, a lot of you are trying to build is the complete universal system. It has taken the Universe millions of years to learn this and you get it for free and you have no respect for it because you still don’t understand. The man of the future would understand what is on this board and praise to his good fortune because it brings man from the village into the civilization of the universe.<br>凯史：你有这个场体的核心，固体的线圈是外层核心，岩浆，固体的表面。这是一个复制品，你必须理解（核心/线圈结构）这是旋转的。每个核心在核心/线圈里面是根据他们各自拥有的强度旋转的，两个不同的场体强度的相互作用创建了拉力和推力。这是最有效率的等离子态太空飞行系统、食物和材料生产系统。这个在你的前面携带的系统，你们许多人正在尝试建造的是完整的通用系统。它拿宇宙数百万年的时间去学习这个，而你免费得到它，而你们对它没有应有的尊重，因为你任然不明白。今后的人类将理解加入的是什么并赞叹他的好运气，因为它带领人类从地球村进入宇宙的文明。</p>
<p>K: there is no more to it; if you look at it, draw it in a different way. (1.05.13 minutes and he draws a circle spiraling out). You see it covers everything from the strongest in the center plasmatic matter state. Now you see what we told you from the beginning have been the essence of creation. Now if you understand this and if you can position this then you understand how easily you can build energy. Build the GANS of gold and make the liquid of gold and then make the field of gold. And then put the GANS of gold into this container and get yourself a core made out of gold, your coils out of GANS goldand nano coat out of gold and the machine will pour out tons of gold—whatever you want because you have dictated the field strength to be of human strength and it is gold. I’m sorry so many people died so many times on this planet for the cheapest way to make the most worthless material on this planet.<br>凯史：它没有更多的了；如果你看着它，用不同的方法绘制它。(1.05.13分钟，他画了一个向外的螺旋线)。你看它覆盖了所有东西从最强的到中心的等离子态物质状态。现在你看到了我告诉过你的从一开始就存在的创造的本质。现在如果你理解这个，如果你能够定位这个，然后你就明白如何轻易地构建能量。建造黄金甘斯以及制造黄金的液体，然后制造黄金的场体。然后把黄金甘斯放入容器，获得你自己的一个核心制造出黄金。你的线圈在金甘斯外面且纳米涂层出黄金，这个机器将输出黄金—无论你想要什么，因为你有人类的优势去设定场体强度，它是黄金。抱歉，许多人因为用便宜的方法去制造很多这个星球上毫无价值的材料在这个星球上死了很多次。</p>
<p>K: you want silver? Make a silver core. You want copper? Make a copper core. Make the core, the coil from the copper GANS, and the nano out of copper and put it through and find the right rotational speed that you will produce so much copper that the copper industry will collapse. Then you have it in any shape of form you like because then you can create the field forces that will be round, 2 inches in diameter or flat as a pancake. Now you see how credible the technology is. You have gone all the gone all the way through it. But the lack of trust on your own because you have been built that way to never trust yourself until somebody tells you and now you understand some people an their own activators. But the knowledge of the universe is cheap.<br>凯史：你想要银？制造一个银内核。你想要铜？制造一个铜内核。制造这个内核，这个线圈来自铜甘斯，纳米涂层铜，把它通过找到正确的旋转速度，那么你将生产如此多的铜，然后铜工业将会崩溃。然后以你喜欢的任何形式拥有它，因为你可以创造这个场体的力量，那将达到2英寸的直径也许是平面的。现在你看到这个科技的可信度。你有了所有，所有通过它的方法，但是缺乏自己的信任，因为你已经建立了绝不信任自己的（信念），直到某些人告诉你，现在你明白了某些人就是他们自己的催化剂。然而这个宇宙的知识是不值钱的。</p>
<p>K: Now you have to start understanding that no man should be a slave to anything. You will understand the way our dear friend Alecx does. You apply the knowledge to this and you will have the orange, the banana and everything you want in this process. You know everything you need; the knowledge is complete and correct and it is for you to start opening avenues of this application according to the need of the man. As I said this morning when it’s the last man standing on this planet, there is plenty and you should not worry about agriculture; there is enough to feed you. If you are in space you will not be able to find agriculture, but the energy field of the matter is with you and what existence depends on is in the core and you can develop it and you can use it. If you understand it you can extend it and step by step develop it to the next step. Bring it to the point that it can be applied, step by step, and that it can be used by humanity or yourself in the future in deep space.<br>凯史：现在你要去理解，没有人是任何事物的奴隶。你将理解这个方法，我们亲爱的朋友亚历克斯理解。你应用这个知识，这样你将拥有橙子、香蕉和每样你想要的东西。你知道你需要的每样事物；这个知识是完整的和正确的，它是为了你们开始去根据人类的需要打开这个应用的途径。就像我说过的，当它是这个星球上最后站立的人，这些是丰足的，你将没有食物方面的担忧；这些足够喂养你。如果你在太空，你将找不到农业，但是物质的能量场与你同在，什么东西存在取决于这个核心，你可以发展它，你可以使用它。如果你理解它，你可以扩展它，逐步发展它到下一个阶段。把它发展到可以应用，一步一步，能够被人类或你自己在深太空中所使用。</p>
<p>K; now you understand how credible the knowledge is. As I said this morning in the teachings of this, sorry for those of you who try to discredit (the knowledge). The only option is one thing: eleventh floor, the long way to drop yourself down and leave humanity in peace. In reality everything has been and shall be correct with the knowledge. Go back; it has taken me 10 years to bring man from the matter state knowledge to the field plasma knowledge. I have paid with my life and my family and attempts by the Red Circle to kill me 4 times so you would not understand (this knowledge). Shot at, rolled at and poisoned. I want to see how many of you they can kill when you come to this knowledge. There are thousands of you who can develop this in a very easy way. When they opened the website for victims of the Red Circle I put my name in and how many times. They have murdered many scientists and killed and destroyed many families for them to be able to keep man enslaved to the matter state, the material world. We have freed you and you are free to run, but understand in this freedom there is a cost. You have to be correct.<br>凯史：现在你明白了这个知识是可靠的。今天早晨的教学我说过这个，对不起，你们那些败坏这个知识的名誉的人。只有一个选择：十一层楼，你们自己跳下去，离开和平的人类。事实上，（这个知识）已经是、必将是在每件事情上都是正确的。过去，我用了十年带领人类从物质状态的知识到场体等离子体知识。我付出我的生命和我的家庭，红圈四次试图刺杀我使你们不能理解这个知识。枪击、殴打、下毒。我要看看，有多少人他们可以杀害，当你们拥有这个知识。有无数的人可以非常非常容易地发展这个知识。他们谋杀很多科学家，杀害和破坏很多家庭以使人类处于被物质，这个物质世界奴役的状态。我们有自由，你和你自由地去做，但是要明白， 在这里自由是有代价的。你是正确的。</p>
<p>K: I explained in the morning teaching this morning and we are looking at this again and again (1.12.08 minutes). You are looking at the operation of this field in what it is—it is straight forward circulation. The simple fact that is overlooked by a lot of you is that thisis your system straight down the line. (1.12.34 minutes—the core and the coils). But what do we see? Most of life on the systems is hard to accept. We all know that this plasma (1.13.03 minutes) is slightly tilted. But the force of the fields on this planet does nothing but on another planet it comes in slightly differently and it leads to life. This (planet of the left) is Remus and the (the planet on the right) is Earth. Constant evolution does not create such variation that it allows you creation of whatever it could be (CONH). But here because of the slight tilt and the angle of the operation, life has become possible. So, when you build your system do not stick with the thought that it has to be ‘straight’ on your stand or fan. Make it easier. Instead of changing your speed just change the angle of your motor. When the reactor goes on a tilt (1.14.08 minutes) now the flow goes that way.<br>凯史：在今天早上的教学上，我解释了，我们再三地强调。你要着眼于这个场体的运作，理由是—它是直接地向前的循环，这个简单的事实被忽视，你们许多人是这样的，这是你的系统，向下的直线（核心和线圈）。但是我们看见什么？有很多生命在这个系统上是很难去接受的。我们都知道这个等离子体是轻微倾斜的。在这个星球上的场力没什么，但是在另外的行星上它些微的不同却带来生命。这个（左边的星球）是雷姆斯，这个（右边的星球）是地球。恒定的进化不会创造如此的（生物）变异，它允许你任何的创造它可能是(CONH)。但是，这里，因为轻微的倾斜和运行的角度使生命的创造成为可能。因此，当你建造你的系统而不坚持思考，那么它就是“直线”的站立或者漂浮。使它更容易。不是改变你的机器的速度而是改变角度，当这个反应器继续倾斜，现在这个流向那边。</p>
<p>K: understand about positioning and what you see when you have the planet, when you have the star, replicate the exact condition in your system. Then you will see the field of that planet and you will see the life existence on that planet and how existence can be supported and what is in that planet. Then you can replicate that in your system and then you will reach that condition of that position of that planet in that part of the universe. The question is, would you like to travel all the way there or do you want to create the same constant strength and you will be there simultaneously in zero time. Now you sit on the fields of the rotation of that system. We have spoken of this many times. So you see that space travel is not just lifting from this planet. You have a bigger problem when you lift it and you are in space with this system because if you get your field strength wrong, where are you going to land? Did you create the field strength of Planet Zeus or did you create the field strength in the center of the sun to be attracted by it?<br>凯史：理解关于定位，当你拥有这个行星，你看到什么，当你有星星，在你的系统精确地复制这个环境。那么你将看到这个星球的场体和这个星球上有什么。然后你可以把它复制进你的系统，然后你将在这个宇宙里到达那个星球的那个位置的环境。这个问题是，你喜欢去旅行到那里还是你想去创造出相同的场体强度，你将零延时地到达那里。现在你坐在那个系统的旋转的场体上。我们很多次谈到这个。因此你看太空旅行不是从这个星球上飞起。当你使它飞升，你会遇到巨大的问题，你是在太空用这个系统，因为如果你的场体强度是错误的，你要到哪里去登陆？你创建了宙斯星球的场体强度或者你创建了太阳中心的场体强度会被它吸引过去？</p>
<p>K: there is the law of field strength in the world of the plasma. It is very easy. Now we understand the totality or at least part of the totality in a clearer way. The plasma evolution of technology and science is so profound that it will touch the life of every single one of you. There is no escape and in the next few weeks we will see all these facts about Mr. Keshe will now go to the people who tried to distract him. Now there is no choice but to bring the mass media in for people to learn how to use a pen to get rid of cancer. Is it that difficult? Or does the Keshe Foundation work and your work have to become ‘underground’ because now we are underground and speaking to scientists in the largest nations who support us. The problem is not to be able to make this change but once we make the change we make a peaceful man out of the man itself. That is the problem. As I always say, you can always dress a monkey but you never make a man out of the monkey. You can put a suit and tie on him and in fancy ladies clothes and make the flag red or black. Now start understanding and try to play and feel comfortable and at ease. Don’t ask questions, answer the questions. Don’t come and say can this do this? Go and try it and say that you did do this and here is what happened and you can do it.<br>凯史：这是等离子体世界的场体强度的法律，它非常容易。现在我们整体地理解它或者至少部分清晰的理解方法。技术和科学的等离子体演化是如此深奥，它将触及你们每一个人的生命。这是不可避免的，接下来几周我们将看到所有关于凯史先生的真实，现在这些人试图设法使他分心。现在这里没有选择地去使媒体教会人们如何使用笔去摆脱癌症。那很困难吗？或者开始基金会的工作和你的工作都转移到“地下”，因为我们现在是在“地下”对很多国家的科学家说话，他们支持我们。</p>
<p>K: the biggest problem with Keshe Foundation, the knowledge seekers and the rest of the people who listen to this teaching is the fear of the failure that it might not do what I think it will do. If it gives then what happens? Nothing. You open a new door in the knowledge of man and now all of humanity is like the opening of the West. Now the space has become the new finding the ocean of knowledge that man needs to bring to thetable. Every single one of you will bring new knowledge in and you will become comfortable with it. We will have new ‘Einsteins, Teslas, Alistairs, and who knows what’ because very soon as it is the habit of the man we will forget all the suffering we did learning the matter, GANS, nano, plasma information. One day we will say that man used to do this. But, the knowledge of man would not be here because of what has been done before.<br>凯史：凯史基金会最大的问题是，知识寻求者和其他在收听这个教学人对失败的担心，那样它可能不做什么，我想它会。如果它产生会发生什么？什么也没有。你打开了人类知识一扇新的大门，现在所有人都喜欢开放的西方。现在太空已经成为新发现的知识的海洋，人类需要将它放到桌面上。你们每一个人将带来新的知识，你与它将成为舒适的。我们将拥有新的“爱因斯坦、特斯拉、Alistairs和你们所知的任何人”，因为很快它是人类的习惯，我们将忘记所有的苦难，我们学习物质、甘斯、纳米、等离子体知识。有一天我们会看见人类使用这个。但是，因为在某事完成之前，人类的知识将不会在这里。</p>
<p>K: the process is very simple; try to explore. We have become space explorers in the truest sense. It doesn’t matter where you are. Are you on the ‘east side?’ Is there an ‘east side’ on this planet; who decided to call it the East? We are all East and it doesn’t matter where you are. When you are in Europe the East is Asia. When you are in America the East is Europe and when you are in Japan, the East is America. So, who is East and who is West? We are all part of the same structure and we are all the same. We have to learn this; the faster we learn this the faster we run. There is one problem and it is us and how much of this information we would like to accept. Now if you accept the totality you ask why you spent 30 years in the university or a different path of education or different cultures of understand when this was so simple. It cannot be something wrong with me so it must be my teachers. Now that I accept the knowledge I have to live with it and change myself.<br>凯史：这个进程非常简单：去探索。在真实的感觉里面，我们会成为太空探险家。无论你在哪里都没有关系。你在“东边”？这里就是在这个行星上的“东边”。谁规定它叫做东方？我们都是东方，它与你在哪里没关系。当你在欧洲，东方是亚洲。当你在美国，东方是欧洲，当你在日本，东方是美国。所以，谁是东方谁又是西方？我们都是同样结构的一部分。我们必须学习这个。我们更快地去学习这个。这里有一个难题，它就是我们愿意接受多少这样的信息。现在如果你全部接受，你问你为什么花费30年在大学里或者不同的教育路径或者异样的文化，当这个是如此简单。不能都是我的错，必定是我的老师。现在我接受这个知识，我要用它生活，改变我自己。</p>
<p>K: today is June 7. Exactly 41 years ago I came to Europe from Iran in 1975 for the second time and I stayed. Coincidentally on June 7, 30 years later I went back to Iran and on my arrival during the time the President was giving a lunch to the senior scientists in Iran. And there was a decision maker of carrying with the technology or leaving it. There was a panel of the leading heads of the universities. I explained the technology and we had lunch and the voting came to whether the technology was going to be developed for the Iranians. Four full professors, heads of the universities, said yes. The 5th one said that if he said yes he was retiring in a few weeks’ time and then he would have to stay and see the technology to develop and I’m too old. I am not going to vote, but I am going to step aside and you take the majority of the four. The correctness is not accepting it or refusing it but setting it the way it should be. Accept it; develop it to the extent that you understand it. The beauty of it is that none of is wrong. No one who puts 10 coils on top of each other or 20 coils next to each other, coils upside down and inside out, putting the balls inside the cores, using the GANS of the core—none of you are wrong.<br>凯史：今天室6月7日。正好是我41年前第二次从伊朗来到欧洲的日子，我留了下来。无独有偶，30年后的6月7日，我返回伊朗，在我停留期间，总统赠与我和几个老科学家午餐。这是一次带来这个科技或者是离开它的决策。这是一个顶尖大学的门面。我们一边午餐一边解释这个科技，我们为是否为了伊朗去发展这个科技投票。四个顶级大学的正教授，说，是的。第五个说，如果他说是的， 他将在几周的时间内退休，然后他将留下来看到这个科技的发展，我太老了，我不会去投票，但是我将回避，你会得到大多数，四票。这个正确性的方法不是接受它或是拒绝它而是放置它。接受它、发展它到你可以理解它的程度。这个好处就在于，你们没有一个人是错误的，没有谁把10个线圈各自放置在顶部或者20个线圈互相紧挨着，线圈倒置或者里外翻转，把球放到核心里面，使用核心的甘斯—你们没有一个人是错误的。</p>
<p>K: Every one of you in this development brings the bouquet of science on the table holding the flowers of the knowledge of the man. So the one who says something is wrong with it, nothing is wrong. Try to understand what you have done. Try to understand so that the rest of us can understand it and develop it and if we need such a thing we can use the knowledge. You have seen it and we are bringing up new scientists. We call it Alecx feed and Benjamin soap and Armen’s or Marco’s this or that. These names become the words of the textbook for the future and we don’t need to look for it. So, we are creating a new life of science with the new scientists of the plasma and all of you are part of it. None of you is wrong. I oppose application when you don’t understand the application and it can be dangerous. I oppose interacting when the knowledge is not there to be carried because it can deliver danger.<br>凯史：你们每一个人在这个发展中，带来这个科学的花束放在桌面上，拿着人类的知识的花束。所以，你们某些人说它某些方面是错的，没有错的。试着去理解你做了什么。试着去理解，所以我们能够明白它和发展它，如果我们需要这些东西我们能够运用这个知识。你已经了解它，我们带领新的科学家。我们叫它亚历克斯喂养和本杰明香皂或者阿曼的或者马可的这个或者那个。这些名字成为自然教科书上的词语，我们不需要去寻找它。所以，我们正在创造科学的新生活与新的等离子科学家，你们所有人都是它的一部分。你们没有一个人是错的。我反对应用，当你不理解这个应用，它会是危险的。我反对应用，当这个知识不是保持在这里，因为它可以带来危险。</p>
<p>K: I oppose people using nano coat material to be inserted in the body of the man because very easily we had the full explanation of it today. The Italian man in Italy has done nano-coated material connected to the material and is running refrigerators and lights. The conversion of the nano material into the energy in a physical matter is a huge delivery of energy when it is the wrong way. If you have the material and the method for it you can process it and deliver it in a simple way. Interact it, bring plasma to the nano, bring plasma into the matter and see the energy released by it that you can use. If you understand the amount of energy you have in the glass balls that you are creating and you can set the right matter side or bring the right space you can move this planet from its position.<br>凯史：我反对人们用纳米材料插入人的身体，者非常容易，今天我强烈地申明这点。意大利人在意大利已经完成纳米涂层材料连接到材料，运行冰箱和灯。纳米材料的能量在转换进入物理的物质里面有巨大的能量产生，当它是错误的方法的时候。如果你有这个材料，为它的这种，你可以处理它，用一种简单的方法产生它。影响它，把等离子体带到纳米，把等离子体带入物质，能够看到能量从它释放，你可以利用。如果你了解你在玻璃球内创造的能量的值，以及你能够设置正确的物质方面或者带来正确的空间，你就能够从它的位置上移动这个星球。</p>
<p>K: this is the difference. You have to understand which way you are going and you have to understand space gap energy. This is going to be one of your biggest problems in this technology. In space if you do not understand this space gap, God help you in space. This space gap (1.26.37 minutes) is sacrosanct. You don’t understand it and you play with your existence. In time a lot of you will experience huge shocks and some of you have because what you tried to do was you space gapped. (1.27.01 minutes). But you don’t see it. The bigger the space gap the bigger energy you release and the more matter state you become and the more physical motion and rotation you can create. This is what I have been talking and teaching with our innovation center. If the innovation center understands within the next few weeks, and I just guide them, they should be able to be deliver the first cars without fuel. Mechanical cars would be without fuel. All you do is go to the back of the house, go to the back of the car, take the fuel tank and throw it on the street. The cost of conversion is “very expensive’…maybe about ten cents and no more. Because you bring the energy of the plasma into the matter state.<br>凯史：这是差别：你理解你正在走的道路，你理解太空能量间隙，在太空上帝会帮助你。这个太空间隙是神圣的；你不理解它，你与你的存在游戏，此刻，你们许多人会经历巨大的冲击以及别的，因为你尽力去做的是你的空间裂缝。但是你看不见它。你释放更大的空间裂缝和更大的能量，你可以创造变成更多的物质状态和更多的物理运动和旋转。这就是我与我们创新中心一直谈论和教导的。如果接下来几周我们的创新中心能够理解，我只是引领他们，他们应该能够首次做出不用燃料的汽车。机械的汽车将不用燃料。你要做的就是回到房子后面,回到汽车后面， 把油箱扔到街上去。转换（改变信仰）的代价是“非常昂贵的”……也许是10美分，不会更多，因为你把等离子体的能量带入物质状态。</p>
<p>K: is Bernie on the line? Or Renon? Do you understand what I am showing you?<br>凯史：伯尼在线吗？或者雷农？你明白我给你们展示的吗？</p>
<p>Renon (R): I’m here and I’m taking notes.<br>雷农：我在。我正在做笔记。</p>
<p>K: now you understand how you have to run the engine.<br>凯史：现在你理解了你如何运行这个发动机。</p>
<p>R: yes, and I will let Bernie review as he is not online right now. We are going to apply this.<br>雷农：是的，我将让伯尼复习，他现在不在线。我们正在运用这个。</p>
<p>K: you understand what we said in the discussion yesterday? It’s jumping the fields, jumping the levels. This is important and if you understand and if you jump from plasma to matter (the universe way) you create huge physical motion. If you jump from the matter to plasma way, you create huge plasmatic field motion. Because the steps from the matter to the field you have to release fields that are surplus until you come to the matter state. On the universal side (1.29.49 minutes) you release huge plasmatic states which face the matter and they release the energy. If you look at this in a different way, the field plasma (on the universal side) is like a dam. And the matter state is like a turbine. If you release, depending on the height of the drop, depends on the power of production. You will see this again and again in the plasma technology. If you tilt it, put it an angle, do it straight, all ways count. Any questions?<br>凯史：你理解昨天我们谈论的吗？它是场体跳跃，跳跃这个层。很重要，如果你理解，如果你从等离子体跳跃到物质（宇宙之道）你创造巨大的物理运动。如果你从物质状态向等离子体跳跃，你创造巨大的等离子态的场体运动。因为在从物质到场体这个阶段你会释放过剩的场体直到你来到物质状态。在宇宙一侧，你释放巨大的等离子态的状态，那朝向物质，它们释放能量。如果你用不同的方法观察这个，场体等离子体（在宇宙一侧）就像一个水坝（障碍），物质状态就像一个涡轮机。如果你释放，取决于滴落（水坝）的高度，取决于产品（涡轮机）的力量。在等离子科技里面，你将不断看见这个（现象）。如果你倾斜它，设定一个角度，直线地做，所有的方法都有价值。有任何问题吗？</p>
<p>1.30.45<br>Rick with Questions: you mentioned the earth could be moved with the right plasma and someone asks that perhaps that is what the pyramids did was to move the earth to different positions. Is that possible?<br>瑞克问：你提到用正确的等离子体有可能移动地球，某人问，那也许埃及金字塔是用来移动地球到不同的位置的，有这个可能吗？</p>
<p>K: we leave that to the imagination of the man<br>凯史：让我们离开这个人的空想。</p>
<p>K: we are running so fast with the knowledge transfer that people don’t have time to catch up; in a few weeks’ time there will be a lot of knowledge being disbursed. We are understanding and developing new technologies the same as when I started talking about the nano materials and then the GANS and everyone said I was changing directions saying “we were all doing something and then we go somewhere else.” Now you understand why. That section was finished. Now we are entering the space technology and it’s going very fast. Those who are stuck with the matter state thinking will have a lot of problems.<br>凯史：我们传递这些知识如此迅速，人们没有时间跟上，在几周的时间之内，许多的知识被传递出来。我们理解并发展新的科技，同时，当我开始谈论关于纳米材料，然后甘斯，每个人说我转向，说：“我们都正在做这些事情的时候，我们又去另外的地方。”现在你理解为什么。那个阶段已经完成了。现在我们进入太空科技，它进展非常快。那些困在物质思维的人将有许多问题。<br>Jackie (J): I have just one question:<br>杰克：我只有一个问题：</p>
<p>K: Hi Jackie, you are still alive and not eating?<br>凯史：嗨杰克，你没有吃东西还一直活着吗？</p>
<p>J: yes, sure. When we are in the GANS state and we changed the environment and released the energy and now we have no more physical GANS when the energy is released in the new state can we make the process infinite less.<br>杰克：是的，确实。当我们在甘斯状态里面，我们转变了情感，释放了能量，现在当这个能量在新的状态释放的时候我们不需要更多的物质状态的甘斯，我们可以使这个过程无限小。</p>
<p>K: if you understand how to make the liquid GANS before you release the energy of the GANS you can even dictate the strength you want that new field to collect. You learn slowly and I teach you slowly how to predetermine because if you understand this, and this is a very good point you brought up, then you can pre-pack and predetermine the shape and the size of this plasma ( 1.33.26 minutes) that you are going to release due to the creation and the right mixture. Don’t underestimate making the right mixture in the plasma of the water you can treat it in the shape of your plasma fields and you can predetermine the position of it. And then you understand what I said for a long that in the space technology you create fields of the plasma without containment. So, yes you can determine this and these are the arts you come up with. We will have art (forms) of the plasma coming up in all sorts of shapes.<br>凯史：当你理解了如何去制造液体甘斯之前，你释放甘斯的能量，你甚至可以规定其强度，你想要去收集新的场体。你慢慢学习，我慢慢教你如何去预先决定，因为如果你理解这个，你带出来这个很好的一点，然后你可以预先包装，预先确定等离子体的形状和尺寸，那样你去释放，归因于创造和正确的混合。不要小看正确的混合等离子体的液体，你可以探讨你的等离子体场体的形状，你可以预先确定它的位置。然后你理解了我长期所说的在太空科技里，你创造等离子体场体突破限制。所以，是的，你可以决定这个，这些是想出的艺术。我们将（培养）等离子体的艺术，准备好各种形状。<br>K: this is what I said to you: by thinking and by pushing your brain you dictate the shape and the strength of the fields of the plasma. Now you understand how. You can dictate if you want your plasma to be 10 centimeters or 2 centimeters and what strength. Don’t forget, you know this extremely well; it’s part of your daily life. You smell and it reminds you of the position of the food, the cuddle of the mother and everything else. How come this is so strange to you? You pass the field, you smell on the field and it gives you the smell, taste and position of what that field carries. I can smell roses and then I see the redness, the color, the thorns and what you gave and what rose you gave to whom and what emotion it brought you. You have already been playing with the field plasma exactly as your nano material from the day that you ‘barbecued.’ This is the strengthening of your understanding into your own structure of the creation.<br>凯史：这是我对你们说的：思维和促进你的大脑，你规定等离子体场体的形状和强度。现在你们知道怎么做了。你可以规定如果想要你的等离子体是10厘米或2厘米和什么强度。不要忘记，你知道这个是很好的：它是你日常生活的一部分。你嗅到，它提醒你食物的位置，母亲的拥抱以及其他事情。你们什么时候让这些变得生疏？你经过场体，你闻到场体，它给你气味，场体携带的味道和位置。我可以嗅到玫瑰，然后我看见红色，颜色，刺和你的赠与，玫瑰你赠予谁，会带给你什么情感。你们早就会玩场体等离子体，正如自从你们“户外烧烤”的那天起就在玩你的纳米材料。这是进入你自己创造的结构去强化你们的理解。</p>
<p>K: you know all of it; as I said to our friends in Ghana, we have all been for 6000 years amino acid GANS makers and we call it the soap. So yes you can do anything you like. Anything, because your imagination is a field plasma and it has no containment and it hasno material but it is created by inspiration, aspiration and by understanding of the emotion that is connected to it. If you understand that people like Dr. Rodrigo, it should be no problem for you to handle diseases or conditions like what we call <strong>_</strong>.<br>凯史：你知道它的整体：正如我对我们加纳的朋友所说：我们是6000年的氨基酸甘斯制造者，我们叫它肥皂。所以是的，你可以做你喜欢的任何东西。任何事物，因为你的想象力就是一个场体等离子体，它没有限制，它没有材料，它仅仅是通过情感的理解创造于灵感、渴望，换句话说也就只是与它有关。如果你理解人们，像罗德里戈先生，去处理疾病将没有问题或者就像我们所谓的—-。</p>
<p>J: I have one other. When you come from the GANS and change the process you make the new materials. We play with that so we can again play with these new materials.<br>杰克：我还有另外一个。当你来自甘斯，转变这个进程，你制造新的材料。我们与那个游戏，所以我们可以再次与这些新材料游戏。</p>
<p>K: of course. But now it is refined and exactly the way you want it.<br>凯史：当然。但是现在你必须采取微妙的和精确的方式。</p>
<p>J: thank you very much.<br>杰克：非常感谢。</p>
<p>R: question from Mark: does consciousness travel in plasma?<br>瑞克：来自马可的问题：是我们的意识在等离子体里旅行吗？</p>
<p>K: consciousness is made by the plasma. Would you like to show the expansion of the knowledge by Africa please?<br>凯史：意识是由等离子体制造的。你想要展示由非洲对这个知识的扩展吗？请。</p>
<p>R: the Togo presentation?<br>瑞克：多哥展示的？</p>
<p>K: yes, and if he is online he can explain to us.<br>凯史:是的，如果他在线他可以向我没解释。</p>
<p>Paul YatouteMagiuman, family Togo/Keshe Foundation Togo. (1.38.11 minutes):<br>Paul YatouteMagiuman,多哥家庭/凯史基金会  多哥</p>
<p>Paul (P): hello Mr. Keshe.<br>保罗：您好，凯史先生。</p>
<p>K: would you enlighten us? Go ahead and explain what I call the ‘old knowledge’ of man.<br>凯史：你将给我们启发吗？开始解释我所谓人类的“古老的知识”。</p>
<p>P: I will make a comment. We have two logos and the first is planet earth and you can see there are different parts and every part is represented by one country and every country in the world must be for us and Keshe Foundation plasmatic energy. We can reach for the good of one planet, one nation and one race. You can see the different activities I have done in Togo. Second page is Gans Production. We have made the GANS production in a basic way. In this specific way you will see how we have made the GANS in African realities. This is CO3 GANS. (1.42.54 minutes) I take one bottle like a coca cola and put a small coil inside and I put the zinc. Normally when we put copper and zinc we should get CO2 but in this case we have CH3. Here the copper is not nano coated physically, but at the plasma level I have nano coated the copper. That is why when you combine zinc and copper and you don’t nano coat it we get CH3 GANS. Everybody can see it is making the GANS.<br>保罗：我将发表评论。我们有两套逻辑，第一是行星地球，在这里你可以看到不同的部分，每个部分代表一个国家，这个世界的每一个国家对我们凯史基金会来说都是等离子态的能量。我们可以为了利益在这个行星上伸手去拿，一个国家，一个种族。你可以看到不同的活动，我在多哥完成。第二页是甘斯产品。我们用基本的方法制造甘斯，在这个特殊的方法里面，你将看到我们如何在非洲的现实里面制造甘斯。这是CO3甘斯，我拿一个瓶子，类似与可口可乐的瓶子，把一个小线圈放入里面，我放入锌。通常当我们放入铜和锌我们会得到CO2，但是在这里我们获得CH3.这里铜没有经过纳米涂层，但是在等离子体层面上我有对铜纳米涂层。那就是为什么当你连接锌和铜，你没有纳米涂层它我们能获得CH3甘斯。每个人都可以看到它是这么制造的甘斯。</p>
<p>P: the second GANS of CO2 with distilled water. (1.44.28 minutes). I just put here coils and the zinc plate for the first time. For the 2nd time, I didn’t nano-coat the coils at the plasma oil. You can see the condition with the difference at the plasma level. Here we get production of CO2 GANS.<br>保罗：第二CO2的甘斯用蒸馏水。我是首次把这里放入线圈和锌版。第二次，我不用等离子油纳米涂层这个线圈。你可以看到等离子层面不同的的条件。这里我们得到CO2甘斯产品。</p>
<p>P: the next page is CO2 GANS with sea water. We can see when we finished the production after the GANS; the color of the GANS water is blue. I have washed the GANS. What comes from the blue color for the GANS water?<br>保罗：下一页是CO2甘斯和海水。当我们结束生产之后我们可以看到甘斯；甘斯水的颜色是蓝色的。我清洗甘斯。来自甘斯水的蓝色是什么？</p>
<p>K: I can’t explain and I don’t know what you have done. We see this, because you had copper in it, as part of the copper oxide nanoGANS and it becomes bluish and it has to do with the copper in your system. Usually we this color and it’s the color of the GANS of the pure copper. I have seen this with darker blue with the ones I have done. Do you use caustic in these bottles or just water?<br>凯史：我不能解释，我不知道你如何做的。我们看到这个，但是你在他里面放有铜，好像纳米氧化铜的一部分，使它变成带有蓝色，在你的系统里面用到铜。通常是这个颜色，它是纯铜甘斯的颜色。我看到过更暗的蓝色，我用这个方法我做过。你在瓶子里用了烧碱或者只是水？</p>
<p>P: yes, just water.<br>保罗：是的，只是水。<br>K: you don’t add any caustic?<br>凯史：你没有加入烧碱？</p>
<p>P: I didn’t add any caustic.<br>保罗：我没有添加任何烧碱。</p>
<p>K: how do you connect it if there is no caustic? I see wires in the background.<br>你如何连接它如果这里没有烧碱？我看到后面接了电线。</p>
<p>P: I didn’t make connection; I just put the plates and didn’t use connection. (1.47.40 minutes).<br>保罗：我没有接通；我只是放了些盘子，没有连接。</p>
<p>K: so the copper wires are not nano-coated?<br>凯史：所以铜线也没有纳米涂层？</p>
<p>P: it is not nano-coated and it also is not connected on to another.<br>保罗：没有涂层，其他的也没有涂层。</p>
<p>K: you just put the zinc and the copper?<br>凯史：你只是放入铜和锌？</p>
<p>P: yes I put the zinc and the copper. And I put my intention on that.<br>保罗：是的，我放入锌和铜。我在那里面加入了我的意图。</p>
<p>K: your intentions?<br>凯史：你的意图？</p>
<p>P: yes, I give my intention.<br>保罗：是的，我的意图。</p>
<p>K: so you use the same setup but by intention you produced it for materials. Am I correct?<br>凯史：所以你用同样的设置，用你的意图你去生产这个材料。我理解对吗？</p>
<p>P: yes.<br>保罗：对的。</p>
<p>K: if your intention is to produce white CO2 then you produce white CO2 with the same copper, the same water and the same zinc and if you wish produce CH3 you produce it because you wish for that.<br>凯史：如果你的意图是生产CO2，然后你生产CO2用同样的铜，同样的水和同样的锌，如果你希望生产CH3你就生产它，因为你希望那样。</p>
<p>P: yes. The 4th slide is CO2 sea water GANS. Here you have the copy and the original. The first one we got and I make a duplicate. The way I do that is to take water and put it and make my intention and leave it next to the first bottle of the GANS. (1.49.56 minutes). After some days it also started giving GANS. The original is there with the copy.<br>保罗：是的。第四个是CO2海水甘斯。这里你有复制和原始的。第一个我们获得，我制造了一个复制品。我所做的方法是拿水，把它放入我的意图，离开它去第一个甘斯的瓶子。过几天它总是给你甘斯。原有的复制品。<br>P: the next page is the sea water GANS copy. (1.50.25 minutes). Here is the process of washing the copy of the GANS. I did the copy and I washed it.<br>保罗：下一页是海水甘斯复制。这是清洗甘斯副本的过程。我制作的副本我清洗它。</p>
<p>P: the next page is CH3 with double coil and zinc plate. (1.50.50 minutes). These are with the double coil and zinc plate.<br>保罗：下一页是用双线圈和锌板做的CH3。这是双线圈和锌板。</p>
<p>K: can you explain how you make the bottle so full of the GANS?<br>凯史：你可以解释你是如何使你的瓶子里满是甘斯的？</p>
<p>P: CH3 one?<br>保罗：CH3这个？</p>
<p>K: how do you make the bottle full, by praying (intention?)<br>凯史：你如何使得这个瓶子里装满，用祈祷（意图？）</p>
<p>P: yes I increase the level by praying.<br>保罗：是的，我提高祈祷的水平。</p>
<p>K: it says CH3 with the double coil. What is the double coil? Is double coil of zinc or double coil of copper?<br>凯史：就是说CH3用双线圈。双线圈是什么？是双的锌线圈还是双的铜线圈？</p>
<p>P: it is double coil of copper.<br>保罗：是双的铜线圈。</p>
<p>K: so this is all trying to understand. With the earlier one you used a single coil with a zinc plate and you wished to get CO2 and you got CO2. With this picture you wanted CO2 with zinc plate and double copper wire and that gave you CH3. Can you tell us something—how do you know this is CH3 please?<br>凯史：所以这是整体地尝试去理解。早期你用单线圈用锌板，你清洗你得到的CO2，你得到CO2。这张照片你想要用锌板和双线圈得到CO2而你得到CH3。请你可以告诉我们一些事情—你怎么知道这是CH3？</p>
<p>P: the color or the property?<br>保罗：这个颜色或者性质？</p>
<p>K: carry one, we will come back.<br>凯史：继续，我们将回来。</p>
<p>P: the next page shows CH3—copy. (1.53.10 minutes). Here is CH3 copy. I make water inside and give the intention and I get the CH3 GANS. In the next slide I show my mixed collection of GANS. (1.54.00 minutes).<br>保罗：下一页显示CH3—副本。这是CH3副本。我制作水在里面放入我的意图，我获得CH3甘斯。下一张展示我采集的混合甘斯。</p>
<p>K: how long does it take to make a bottle of GANS?<br>凯史：你做这一瓶甘斯花了多长时间？</p>
<p>P: the time?<br>保罗：时间？</p>
<p>K: yes, how many days?<br>凯史：是的，几天？</p>
<p>P: sometimes it is 28 days and sometimes it is 21 days. The same number of days as in normally making the GANS.<br>保罗：有时候是28天，有时候是21天。正常制作甘斯的时间天数。</p>
<p>K: 21 days to make a bottle of GANS? Thank you. Carry on please.<br>凯史：21天去制作一瓶甘斯？谢谢你，请继续。</p>
<p>P: copy GANS from Jacky—gold GANS and others. (1.55 minutes). One day we were in the private teaching showed gold GANS with plenty of GANS. I didn’t get material to make it. I just took the material and kept it in the universe and when I went home I put water in the bottle and the energy in the bottle. It took six days to get from Jacky’s to home, so this GANS came from Jacky.<br>保罗：复制甘斯出自杰克—金甘斯和其他的。在某次私人教学里面我们展示了金甘斯和大量的甘斯。我没有材料去制造它。我只是拿这个材料，使它维持在在宇宙中，当我回家后，我拿水放入瓶子中，能量在瓶子中。我拿6天去从杰克的家里获得，所以这个甘斯来自杰克。</p>
<p>P: the 10th slide is GANS and copies. (1.55.37 minutes). These are the different GANS and copies.<br>保罗：第十张是甘斯和副本。这是不同的甘斯和副本。</p>
<p>P: the next page shows the copper plate and zinc plate for rain GANS. I have used the small copper 2 centimeter plate and small zinc 2 centimeter plate. I did not nano-coat it physically. In the plasma state the copper is nano-coated.<br>保罗：下一张展示的是铜板和锌板做的雨甘斯。我使用的是同样的2厘米的铜板和小于2厘米的锌板。我没有纳米涂层它本身。在等离子体状态这个铜是经过纳米涂层的。</p>
<p>P: next page is CO2 GANS with rain water. (1.56.42 minutes). These are in the GANS water without the nano coating on the copper. They are in order. The first CO2 GANS is sea water and the second is with rain water. The GANS made in the rain water is whiter than the GANS made in the sea water.<br>保罗：下一页是用雨水做的CO2甘斯。这些是在甘斯水里面没有纳米涂层的铜，它们很合适。第一个是海水甘斯，第二个是雨水做的。这个雨水做的甘斯比海水做得甘斯更白。</p>
<p>P: the coil for the CH3 GANS (1.58.10 minutes). I took this after I have produced the GANS and the color is like blue and it looks like we have nano-coated copper but this is <strong>___</strong>.<br>保罗：这个是用于CH3 的线圈。我用它做了甘斯之后，这个颜色像蓝色，它像我们纳米涂层过的铜，但这是—-。</p>
<p>K: how did you nano coat or GANS coat these coils?<br>凯史：你如何纳米涂层或者甘斯涂层这些线圈？</p>
<p>P: I didn’t make it the GANS made it.<br>保罗：我我没有涂层它，是甘斯涂层了它。</p>
<p>P: coil for sea water GANS. It looked like we have finished and produced the GANS.<br>保罗：线圈用于海水甘斯。它看起来就像我们完成的和生产的甘斯。</p>

The sour taste of lemons is caused by the presence of organic acids. The major acid in lemons is citric acid, which makes up around 5 to 6% of the lemon’s juice. Other acids are also present although in much lower concentrations than citric acid. Malik acid in one of these, present at around 5% of the concentration of citric acid. Vitamin C, Lemons &amp; Scurvy: Lemons contain high levels of vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid. The levels in lemons are around 50mg per 500gl on a part with oranges and around double the amount of limes. Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy, a disease that causes loss of teeth, jaundice and eventually death. In the 1700s, all British ships were required to provide a lemon juice ration to seamen to guard against this disease.<br>保罗：18张，柠檬的化学过程：是什么使柠檬很酸？柠檬的酸味归因于有机酸的存在。柠檬里面主要的酸是柠檬酸，在柠檬的果汁里面占大约5%-6%。也有其他酸存在但相比于柠檬酸其浓度很弱。这里面有一种马利克酸，大约是柠檬酸浓度的5%。维生素C，柠檬与坏血病：柠檬含有较高水平的维生素C ，维生素C又名抗坏血酸。每500克柠檬里面大约有50毫克，是能够从橙子里面提取出的两倍。维生素C缺乏可以导致坏血病，生病后使牙齿不健康、黄疸病最后导致死亡。在17世纪，所有的大不列颠船都要求给船员定量配给柠檬汁以防止这个疾病。</p>

<p>B. Yam generator and I made coils and made connection. 2.15.19 minutes<br>I made the connection and we got 9.3V. I make these for one dollar. After 6 months of giving electricity the yams are still ready to eat.<br>B–山药发电机，我制作线圈使它们连接。<br>我制作连接，我们获得9.3伏。我制作这些用了1美元。这些山药供电6个月之后仍然可以吃。</p>
<p>C. Rain water generator. Coil and packing, voltage is 50V. We get electricity with these in water.<br>C、雨水发电机。线圈和填料，50伏。我们在这些水里获得电流。</p>
<p>D. Tree Generator– I don’t know if you see there is no connection<br>D、树木发电机—我不知道如果你看这里没有连接。</p>
<p>E. Food: We made ourselves food; elements of Nut of Avocado plus (CO2 plus CH3 plus CuO plus ZaO) liquid plasma; the nuts of the avocado were grated. (2.17.29 minutes). The grated seeds were toasted on the fire. We mix these with the liquid plasma and we package for finite food of avocadoes.<br>E、食物：我们制作自己的食物：鳄梨的果仁的一小部分加（CO2加CuO加ZnO）液体等离子体；鳄梨的果仁磨碎。磨碎的果仁在火上烤。我们用液体等离子体混合这些，然后包装这些鳄梨食物。</p>
<p>F. Health Unit: (2.19.02 minutes). We did not make coils but it stills works. We put the wood that is nano coated and the universe plasma energy is on it. Plate for coil 2.20.23 minutes. I did not put coils or connection. Coil setting – if I want to put coils you can see that I can put them on the back. (2.21.31 minutes).<br>健康单元：我们不制作线圈但是它仍然工作。我们把木材纳米涂层，宇宙的等离子体能量就在它上面。碟形线圈。我没有把线圈连接。线圈放置—如果我想要放置线圈，你可以看到，我可以把它放到这个后面。</p>
<p>This was presented by Keshe Family Togo/Keshe Foundation Togo. This is our presentation for what we have made.<br>这是由凯史基金会成员/多哥凯史基金会，这是我们展示的作品。</p>
<p>K: thank you very much; this is fantastic. You don’t need complicated things. I would like you to go to #16 and #17. How the process you wish to create the same way you produce your CH3 or CO2?<br>凯史：非常感谢你；这是奇异的。你不需要复杂的事情。我想要你去到16#和17#。你如何用你的意愿去用同样的方法创造你的CH3或者CO2？</p>
<p>P: this is the same way and when I take a coil I pray on the coil; I pray on the zinc and I pray on these and put the water and the zinc and copper.<br>保罗：这是同样的方法，当我拿一个线圈，我对祝愿这个线圈上：我祝愿上面有锌我祝愿这些，把锌和铜放入水中。</p>
<p>K: no nano coating?<br>凯史：没有纳米涂层？</p>
<p>P: no we did not nano coat.<br>保罗：没有纳米涂层。</p>
<p>K: what do you do with the CO2?<br>凯史：你怎么做CO2？</p>
<p>P: I put zinc, copper. The coil is not nano-coated and I pray on the coil.<br>保罗：我放锌、铜。这个线圈没有纳米涂层，我在线圈上祝愿。<br>K: so your CH3 and CO2 is the same copper and same zinc. It is how you pray that you get what you want.<br>凯史：所以你的CH3和CO2是同样的铜和锌。你如何祝愿你获得你想要的呢？</p>
<p>P: yes, it is the same copper and the same zinc and the intention is different.<br>保罗：是的，是同样的铜和同样的锌，只是意图不同。</p>
<p>K: you leave this from 21 days to 28 days?<br>凯史：你分离开这个21天到28天？</p>
<p>P: I have more than that at home and I will leave it 28 days.<br>保罗：我在家里比那个还多，我离开它28天。</p>
<p>K: so you use the same material and your intentions are what changes the matter.<br>凯史：所以你用同样的材料和你的意图使材料发生某种变化。</p>
<p>P: yes. The same material and the intention is different.<br>保罗：是的。同样的材料和不同的意图。</p>
<p>K: can we go down to the cancer pomade? You are using lemon, soursop. Can we see the composition of the soursop? Show me the data on the soursop.<br>凯史：我们可以看看你的癌症涂膏吗？你是用柠檬、刺番荔枝。我们可以看看刺番荔枝的成分吗？给我们展示刺番荔枝的数据。</p>
<p>Molecular components of soursop:<br>刺番荔枝的化学成分：</p>
<p>K: what is the soursop? Okay. Wait just a moment.<br>凯史：刺番荔枝是什么？好的，稍等。</p>

<p>K: tell us about soursop.<br>凯史：给我们介绍下刺番荔枝。</p>
<p>P: it is a fruit that you can eat and it is plentiful in Africa and in Togo. If you have $1 you can 20 of these fruits. We use them like mangoes and eat them. It is recommended for people to eat who have cancer. I implemented the energy of soursop and put CO2 GANS with it.<br>保罗：它是一种可以食用的水果，在非洲的多哥有很多。如果你有一美元，可以买到20个。我们像芒果一样吃它们。有癌症的人推荐吃这个。我把刺番荔枝的能量放入CO2甘斯。</p>
<p>K: stop! Go back to the picture with the data. Slide 17 and go down now to the method of production and then we will come back to this. Okay on slide 18 stop at the lemon. Take a screen shot of 17 and 18, Rick.<br>凯史：停下！回到数据的图片。地17张，现在向下到生产的方法，我们将回到这个。好多，在第18张柠檬那里停下。分享17和18张的屏幕，瑞克。</p>
<p>P: slide 18, the chemistry of a lemon: What makes lemons sour? The sour taste of lemons is caused by the presence of organic acids. The major acid in lemons is citric acid, which makes up around 5 to 6% of the lemon’s juice. Other acids are also present although in much lower concentrations than citric acid. Malic acid in one of these, present at around 5% of the concentration of citric acid. Vitamin C, Lemons &amp; Scurvy: Lemons contain high levels of vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid. The levels in lemons are around 50mg per 500gl on a part with oranges and around double the amount of limes. Vitamin C deficiency can lead to scurvy, a disease that causes loss of teeth, jaundice and eventually death. In the 1700s, all British ships were required to provide a lemon juice ration to seamen to guard against this disease.<br>保罗：第18张，柠檬的化学过程：是什么使柠檬很酸？柠檬的酸味归因于有机酸的存在。柠檬里面主要的酸是柠檬酸，在柠檬的果汁里面占大约5%-6%。也有其他酸存在但相比于柠檬酸其浓度很弱。这里面有一种马利克酸，大约是柠檬酸浓度的5%。维生素C，柠檬与坏血病：柠檬含有较高水平的维生素C ，维生素C又名抗坏血酸。每500克柠檬里面大约有50毫克，是能够从橙子里面提取出的两倍。维生素C缺乏可以导致坏血病，生病后使牙齿不健康、黄疸病最后导致死亡。在17世纪，所有的大不列颠船都要求给船员定量配给柠檬汁以防止这个疾病。</p>
<p>K: you mix the lemon with the soursop and mixed with the CO2 and shea butter.<br>凯史：你用柠檬与刺番荔枝混合，用CO2与乳木果油混合。</p>
<p>P: shea butter is from the shea nuts and comes only from Africa.<br>保罗：乳木果油来自仅产于非洲的乳木果。</p>
<p>K: what material is shea?<br>凯史：乳木果是什么材料？</p>
<p>P: it is a nut.<br>保罗：是坚果类。</p>
<p>K: is this the same as the ground nuts you have in West Africa?<br>凯史：这像花生一样，你在西非？</p>
<p>P: it is bigger than the ground nuts; you have to break them and you find the shea. To get to the oil you put it in the fire.<br>保罗：它比花生更大。你剥开它们，拿果仁到火上烤，就得到它们的油。</p>
<p>K: I know how they make ground nut oil; I have seen that in Africa. So this is different than ground nuts. This is fantastic and what you have brought us is a gift. So you take the lemon and then add the CO2 GANS and the shea butter. Do you cook it together?<br>凯史：我知道它们如何制作花生油:我在非洲看到过。所以这与花生不同。这是你给我们带来的一份奇异的礼物。你拿柠檬然后添加CO2甘斯和乳木果油。你把他们一起烹调？</p>
<p>P: I heat the shea butter and then add the lemon, soursop and CO2 GANS. I mix it all and cook it.<br>保罗：我加热乳木果，然后添加柠檬，刺番荔枝和CO2甘斯。我混合它们并烹调它。</p>
<p>K: citronella is lemongrass?<br>凯史：香茅油是柠檬香草？</p>
<p>P: yes.<br>保罗：是的。</p>
<p>K: how long do you cook the shea butter and lemon?<br>凯史：你烹调乳木果油和柠檬多长时间？</p>
<p>P: 5 minutes.<br>保罗：5分钟。</p>
<p>K: how long have you tested this for cancer in Africa?<br>凯史：你在非洲给癌症患者测试这个多长时间了？</p>
<p>P: one month.<br>保罗：一个月。</p>
<p>K: what are the results, what do you see?<br>凯史：成果如何？你看到了什么？</p>
<p>P: after one month the person doesn’t want to go to the hospital because they don’t feel any pain. The person doesn’t want to go to the hospital because they don’t have pain.<br>保罗：一个月以后这个人不想去医院了，因为他没有感觉到任何疼痛。这个人不想去医院了，因为他已经没有疼痛了。</p>
<p>K: it doesn’t mean if they don’t feel the pain that there is no cancer. This is worth looking into because of the number of reasons you brought up. Tell me of the components—how long has this been used in Africa for cancer or is it something you have done?<br>凯史：没有疼痛并不意味着没有癌症了。还是值得去看一下，因为是你提出的数量的原因。告诉我这个成分—在非洲被用于治疗癌症有多长的时间了，或者它是你做的某种事情？</p>
<p>P: everybody, well many know. This is the first time I have produced these components and before they only used soursop.<br>保罗：每个人，很多人都知道。这是首次我使用这些成分，之前它们只用刺番荔枝。</p>
<p>K: get the picture of soursop; this is very interesting. Rick put the picture of the soursop and the lemon next to it. This is very interesting and you see the work of nature in so many ways. (2.40.50 minutes). If you look at the composition of the soursop you see everything; if you use this mixture and if you rub this oil on your coils that you showed us on your upright system, it should be an effective field process for most of the diseases known to man. I think Dr. Rodrigo will want to see this. I tell you why—this is a fantastic piece of knowledge the Africans have been using in a natural way. In this simplicity you can produce everything: sodium, lemon, NaOH. In the stomach of the man, the sodium creates sodium oxide hydroxide which is the caustic. You have that with this lemon with the OH sitting everywhere and you created a caustic. You have the zinc and most cancer has an emotional basis and now you have entered the body with the condition of what it needs: potassium, phosphorus. This fruit is a cancer fruit. It is in conjunction the way you have mixed, if you go back to the Ghana teaching last week and by adding CO2 you increased the natural protein and here you have used shea butter.<br>凯史：拿出刺番荔枝的照片，这非常有趣。瑞克，把刺番荔枝和它的下一张柠檬的照片放出来。如果你观察刺番荔枝的成分，你看每件事物；如果你使用混合物，如果你把这个油擦在你的线圈上，那个你给我们展示的垂直系统，它对于大多数人类已知的疾病是有效的磁场。我想罗德里戈医生会想要看看这个。我告诉你为什么—这是一个奇异的知识，非洲人在自然之道内的运用。这个简单的方法你可以生产每样东西：钠、柠檬、氢氧化钠。在人类的胃里，钠创造了氧化钠的氢氧化物，那就是苛性钠。你那里到处都有柠檬与氢氧根，你创造了腐蚀剂。你有锌，大多数癌症都有情绪基础，现在你进入身体有它所需要的条件：钾、磷。这个水果是一个癌症水果。它同时发生的，你用混合的方法，如果你回到上周加纳的教学，由于添加CO2你增强了自然蛋白质，这里你用了乳木果油。</p>
<p>K: If you use the same process or add animal fat into this I think it is a very natural cancer system because with adding the CO2 which you added we saw the reason the system works with the shea butter, lemon juice and the CO2 you increase the potency. The CO2 brings the plasmatic condition with the Gans and with the condition which has already created a natural GANS system. What is on this board with the new knowledge which we have and strange enough, look what it is. You have B9, B3, B6. This fruit is a cancer fruit and the only thing missing is the energy that you added with the CO2 and what is interesting is that you created the CO2 with the element of the copper that had the blue tint in it which I said was a nano oxide copper. So with that you bring 100% few elements CUO2 as well. So, it has everything for physical recovery, emotion, caustic to create the copper oxide and the zinc oxide and you have Phosphor which is the backbone of the DNA structure; you have calcium which feeds with the zinc for the growth of the brain cells not to repeat; you have iron which allows for the increased production of hemoglobin within the structure of the amino acid that you put in; and then you have B6 and B9 which assists in the regeneration of the cells.<br>凯史：如果你用同样的过程，添加动物油脂到这里面，我想这也是非常自然的癌症系统，因为增加了CO2，那样你就增加了我们所说的理由，系统与乳木果油、柠檬汁和CO2一同工作，你增大了效能。CO2带来了等离子态的条件，运用这个甘斯运用这个条件，那样已经创造了自然甘斯系统，这加入了足够陌生的新知识，看这是什么，你有B9, B3, B6，这个水果是一个癌症水果，唯一错过的是它的能量，你用CO2来增强，有趣的是你用了少部分的铜创建的CO2，在它里面有浅蓝色，那是我们所谓的纳米氧化铜。所以那里百分之百也有少量的CUO2。所以，它有恢复体力的每样东西：情感、苛性钠去创造氧化铜和氧化锌，你有磷光剂，那是DNA结构的支柱，你有钙，用锌去喂养，为了脑细胞的生长不重复。因为你放有铁去允许在氨基酸的结构内增加血红蛋白的生产，然后你有B6和B9去帮助细胞再生。</p>
<p>K: I would like you to do something. I am going to the market in Italy to find soursop and I will repeat what you have done and give to the medical people we have around here to develop it and we send you this natural product. Try to change from the shea butter to animal fat. Try to test with animal fat because then you bring it to the near level of theacid of the human being and repeat the same process. But you are rubbing this on the skin of people where the cancer is, am I correct?<br>凯史：我希望你去做一些事情。我去意大利的市场去找刺番荔枝，我将重复你所做的，去送给附近做医疗系统的人去发展它。我们送你这个自然的产品。尝试把乳木果油改成动物脂肪，尝试去测试用动物脂肪因为那样你使它更接近人类已有的氨基酸水平，重复同样的过程。但是你把它擦在人体有肿瘤的皮肤上，我是正确的吗？</p>
<p>P: I rub in the body of the people where the cancer was.<br>保罗：我用力擦，使它深入有肿瘤的人体内部。</p>
<p>K: it will be interesting if the nano-coated coils you showed us, that beautiful standing upright system, if you can GANS coat those coils with this mixture you make and see the real reaction of the system. This is a natural and the most beautiful natural process. By adding lemon to it you have made a caustic out of it. With it and the CO2 and the water you added has made it to a natural GANS that supports. That is why it could be correct that these molecular components you have listed show the possibility and this is the first time I have seen this. It’s so beautiful. This material if it is used as I was discussing with one of the doctors in one of the teachings last week that the way these upright medical coils work is it touches their arome (?) and they should never get cancer again. When you go through the upright coils and you are standing and what you show here is the clear indication if we can use this fruit with what is there in conjunction with lemon juice which brings in the sodium in the caustic condition. Now in one go you are making GANS of everything in one go.<br>凯史：它将是有趣的，你给我们展示的纳米涂层线圈，直立的系统很漂亮，如果你能够用这个你制作的混合物甘斯涂层那些线圈，看到这个系统的真实反应。这是一个自然的，更是一个美丽的自然过程。由于增加柠檬在它里面，你无意间制造了腐蚀剂。用它与CO2和水，额外地支持你制造了更多的自然甘斯，那就是它为什么可能是正确的，这些你列出的分子成分显示了这个可能性，这是我首次看到这个。它如此美妙。这个材料，如果它被运用，就像我在上周一次医生的教学上说的，这个方法，这些垂直的医疗线圈的工触及了他们的arome (?)，他们将决不会再得癌症。当你走过这个垂直的线圈，你站在中间，你显示这里是清晰的迹象，如果我们能够用这个水果以及用柠檬汁去协同，那将产生钠的腐蚀剂的条件。现在你们一次性去制作所有这些甘斯。</p>
<p>K: This is the beauty of it and once you release it in the cooking you release the sodium and everything – calcium, magnesium, iron and everything – and you are supporting the psychological, the production of the brain cells, the hemoglobin, the magnesium which is the most important part of the structure. Then you support and you embedded in the arome (?) through the change in the DNA. Just go and have a look at the structure of the amino acid or what you call DNA and you will see the backbone is Phosphor. This is one of the one of the strongest cancer systems man could ever produce. It is beautiful. I told you that Africa will be the crown jewel of the spaceship technology. This is an example of it. The knowledge you carry of the food of Africa is there and you have all the tools. This is one of the most beautiful knowledge you could bring us from Africa. Thank you for bringing it.<br>凯史：这是它的美妙之处，一但你释放它，你在烹调过程中你释放钠和每样东西—钙、镁、铁及每样东西—你是在支持心理的，脑细胞的生产，血红蛋白、镁钠是这个结构最关键的部分。然后你支持、你嵌入arome (?)，通过DNA内部的转变。去观察这个氨基酸结构或者你所谓的DNA，你将看到这个结构的支柱是磷光体。这是人类能够生产的最强的癌症系统之一。它很漂亮。我告诉过你们，非洲将是这个宇宙飞船科技王冠上的钻石。这就是一个例子。这是你带来的非洲的食物的知识，你们拥有所有的工具，你给我们从非洲带来这个科技最美妙的知识，感谢你带来它。</p>
<p>P: thank you Mr. Keshe.<br>保罗：谢谢你，凯史先生。</p>
<p>K: take it a step further; change this butter to animal fat. Do you have access to bush meat?<br>凯史：把它带入更深一步：把乳木果油换成动物脂肪。你有可利用的肉类吗？</p>
<p>P: no I don’t.<br>保罗：不，我没有。</p>
<p>K: In Africa you don’t have western fully saturated antibiotic animals. Try to find free range chickens in the villages. Try to get the fat from the chicken and instead of shea butter use that fat. The fat of the free range chickens in Africa is saturated with omega 3. Then cover your coils with a combination of what you make after replacing the shea butter and it will come closer to the protein structure of the man. And use the fat from the chicken. Then make the same structure and use these on the coils of the beautiful system that you showed and I think you will find a very effective system for any kind of cancer. But in the system you showed me and I have explained this to the doctors, you need a leg piece to cover the whole body. Put another piece on the bottom.<br>凯史：在非洲，你不要像西方那样给牲畜渗透抗生素。尝试去找到免费的牧场，在农村喂养小鸡。尝试去从鸡中获得脂肪，去代替乳木果油。在非洲免费牧场养出的小鸡的脂肪含有丰富的欧米茄3。然后用它覆盖你的线圈。你更换了乳木果油之后，它将更加接近人类的蛋白质结构。用小鸡的脂肪，如何制造同样的结构，把这些用到这个美妙的系统的线圈上，如何你展示，我想你会发现一个对任何癌症都有效果的系统，然后你给我展示这个系统，我已经给医生们解释了这个，你需要一个针对腿部的板块以覆盖整个身体。在底部再增加一块。</p>
<p>K: I thank you for bringing us this knowledge. I will use my white board to teach you something. Everything is naturally there to reverse cancer. What I will go back and show this and I am looking from the top and this is what I wanted to teach today. Now you brought such a beautiful gift and I want to share a piece of knowledge with you. You made those two boards (for your medical unit). And this is for Dr. Rodrigo and Dr. Klaus and the medical people. Up to now you put systems in panels and you put your patients inside the two panels. (2.56.17 minutes) Let’s take the knowledge a step further. You created helmets. Go back on the medical application patent.<br>凯史：我感谢你为我们带来这个知识。我将用我的白班教你一些事情。每件事情都是很自然地去逆转癌症。我将回去展示这个，我从顶部着眼，这就是我今天想要教导的。现在你带来如此美妙的礼物，我想要给你分享一点知识。你制造两个板子（为你的医疗单元）。这是为了罗德里戈医生和克劳斯医生以及从事医疗的人们。到目前为止你把系统嵌入面板，你让你的病人站在板子之间。让我们把这个知识引入更深入的阶段。你制造了头盔。回到医疗应用专利。</p>
<p>K: Let’s extend the knowledge. We look from the top down and these are the boards with two sets of coils going down. Now add two more coils, one on either side at the top of the side panels. When you do this you have to take the helmet away and you can add a section in here which covers the totality of the head (2.57.17 minutes). You have also covered the physical part and the immune system and don’t forget when you make the top it has to have coils also, but there has to be a space, a gap, for the center of the brain where any extra energy can pass through. (2.57.40 minutes). So, you have 4 walls and you have coils on the top and now you have created a box that handles the physical, the emotion and everything else. But the two criteria are when you connect the system, before you used to connect the coils down the sides. Now you have to connect around the top. And the end of the beginning goes to a dumper. At the same time you connect each plate to the top. You can add the section to the bottom with the same characteristics and what you create is the field balance. (2.58.53 minutes). What you create is a condition that it can handle any disease.<br>凯史：让我们扩展这个知识。我们看从顶部向下，这些是装有两套线圈的板子。现在添加两套线圈，一套在板子顶部的两侧，当你这么做的时候，你需要将头盔拿开，你能够在这里添加一个截面，那样将会覆盖全部头部。你最终需要去覆盖物质部分和免疫系统，不要忘记，当你制造了这个顶板，它也需要线圈，但是这里要有一定的空间，一个间隙，以使大脑的中心能够通过额外的能量。所以，你有四面墙，有线圈在顶部，现在你就创建了一个盒子，那样能够操纵物质身体、情感和任何别的事情。但是，两个标准是，当你连接系统，在使用之前沿着旁边接通线圈，现在你连接四周和顶部，从顶点到终端倾斜，同时你连接各个板子到顶部。你也可以用同样的方法在底部添加截面，你创造的是场体的平衡。你创造的是一个可以处理任何疾病的条件。</p>
<p>K: In space go back; I spoke to the doctors about this before. Go and put in a swimming pool and put them in the water. The water is the liquid version of the same thing. So this is what you are going to get. This way you create a full balance and you need to put two units opposite each other and you have to get everything in the right order. Now you create a balance in the total body of the man. You change and if you have a cancer patient, put on the coil and you will see wonders. Now if you look at it in so many ways you created a box like the Magrav unit box. The human is in the box in a controlled environment and then you put your coils, the head, the body, immune system on 4 sides; you cover the top and you cover the bottom. This is the kind of system you need in space when you suddenly receive huge amounts of energy. You cannot go section by section. You de-energize the body and this is the only way you can handle the space viruses because they attach to every cell and they don’t go through the digestive system. You dump the energy very fast. It will be interesting to see if you make this and use the GANS of the oil (pomade) that you made. It’s the same process. I explained this in the teaching before. I explain it again so it is very clear.<br>凯史：回到太空（教学）：我之前对医生们谈到过这个。去找个游泳池，把它放到水里，水是它的同样事情的液体版本，所以，这使你们去获得。这个方法你创造了完全的平衡，你需要放置两套相对的组件，你需要正确的顺序去获得每件事情。现在你为人类的身体创造了完整的平衡。你转化，如果你有一个癌症患者，把他放到线圈之间，你会看到奇迹。现在，如果你从多方面观察它，你创建了一个盒子，就像能量单元盒子。人类在盒子的受控环境中，然后你放你的线圈，头部、身体、免疫系统在四面之中；你覆盖顶部，你覆盖底部。你需要在这个空间接这个系统突然产生的这种巨大的能量。你不能一段一段地做，你断开身体的电源，这是你能够处理太空病毒的唯一方法，因为它们不通过消化系统而嵌入每一个细胞， 你很快卸掉它们的能量，去看这个很有趣，如果你制造这个，使用你制作的油甘斯（涂膏）。它是同样的过程。我在之前的教学中解释过这个。我再次解释它，这已经很清楚了。</p>
<p>K: when you make your coil you have a matter state. You added the GANS in the coil. (3.01.33 minutes). Then with it you brought in the water which is the liquid plasma so now you understand what you have been creating. This is the GANS, here was the nano coating and here was the matter state (around the outside). And here in the center space you have is the field plasma. Now you see the coils we have. With no change if you look, you have the copper, the nano materials, and then you added the GANS on top of it. This GANS is the oil you created. What happens? The energy in your coil structure moves along and now you see the energy locks into your system. (3.02.58 minutes). The difference is that now this structure (the coil he drew) is the body of the man. In the GANS state in the liquid water is the energy of the structure. You see the difference. And hereby putting the GANS on top of the nano you brought the energy resources on top of your nano material. That is why these power units are energy sources, these Magrav units. With the coils you have created you have brought the sun to sit on the nano material. It doesn’t need to look for energy; energy is coated on it.<br>凯史：当你制造了你的线圈，你有物质状态。你在线圈中添加甘斯。然后你它引入水，那是液体等离子体，所以，现在你明白你创造了什么。这是甘斯，这里是纳米涂层，这里是物质状态（外部周围）。这里，在中间的空间你有等离子体的场体。现在你看这个线圈。如果你看没有变化，你有铜、纳米材料，然后你添加了甘斯在它顶部。这个甘斯是你制作的油。会发生什么？这个你的线圈结构中的能量前后移动，现在你瞧，这个能量锁在你的系统里面。这个差别是，现在这个结构（他画了个圈）是人的身体。在液体水的甘斯状态是这个结构的能量。你看到这个差别。以在顶部放入纳米的甘斯这种方式，你在顶部引入了你的纳米材料的能量。钠就是为什么这些电力单元是能源，这些能量单元。用制作的线圈你引入了太阳到你的纳米材料上面。它不需要去寻找能量，能量就在涂层上面。</p>
<p>K: in space you change it the other way. I have shown you matter state and plasma state (3.03.59 minutes). Here the plasma sits outside (the drawing on the right) and here the plasma sits inside (the drawing of the coil). This is the proton, the electron and the molecular energy of your life. When you put the oil on the coil which is coated for balanced energy between all the elements of creation, the copper is already inside which is the physical. And, you understand this system should bring magic for any diseases even if you added CO2 to it or CH3 or any kind of <strong>___</strong>. It is fantastic knowledge brought to the table and I thank you very much. Those of you who are familiar with this can use this for more or less any kind of cancer. This has everything not to tangle the cancer, but to assess and balance. When you create the GANS…and please share the screen from Paul with the tables– you see when you have put this material on the coil everything is in the GANS state and when the body comes to it, it takes what it needs and no more. And it brings balance to everything. This is the beauty of it. Sodium with lemon creates a balanced caustic and everything in there is in the GANS state in the atomic structure of the GANS material with the B9—this is a recipe for any cancer. This is a beautiful piece of information and knowledge. If you understand it, elaborate on it and develop it further.<br>凯史：在太空中你改变它到其他方向。我给你们展示了物质状态和等离子状态。这里，等离子体在外面（在右侧画了一圈），这里等离子体在里面（画了一个圈）。这是质子，电子和你的生命分子的能量。当你把油涂在线圈上，那个涂层是在所有能量之间进行平衡的创造的基本原理。先有铜在里面，那是物理身体。以及，你会明白，这个系统将带来针对所有疾病的魔法，甚至在你添加CO2到它或者CH3或者任何种类的—这是放到桌面的奇异的知识，我非常感谢你。你们那些熟悉这个的人，或多或少能够运用这个去治疗任何种类的癌症。不要纠结于癌症，只需要去评估和平衡。当你制造了甘斯…请分享这来自于保罗制作的表格…你瞧，当你在线圈上放这个材料，每件事情都是甘斯状态，当身体来到这里，它取走它需要的，没有更多。它带来每件事情的平衡。这是它的美妙之处。钠与柠檬创造了一种平衡，苛性钠使每样事物处于甘斯状态，在甘斯材料的原子结构中，与B9—这是一个用于任何癌症的处方。这是一个美妙的信息和知识。如果你理解它，详细说明它，进一步发展它。</p>
<p>K: look at this from the agriculture point of view and use this butter and make it liquid enough, you will find out with the magnesium in it you can create a condition that there should be no need for any pesticides and increase the production of any food hugely. This food has the composition and the amount of materials in it is just about enough to do it. You have the potassium, the phosphor, sodium, a little zinc for emotional, and this should be very good for bringing knowledge because of this composition and creating brain cells. And you have B9 which is perfect. If you have stroke or brain hemorrhage this should be the perfect coil to put someone inside it to produce the brain cells. This is a gift Paul and it is amazing what you brought to the table.<br>凯史：从农业的角度看，使用黄油，制造足够的液体，你将在它里面找到镁，你可以创建一种状态，应该能够增加任何农药和任何食品的生产量。在这种食物里面拥有的成分和材料的数量差不多足够了，你有钾、磷光体、钠、少量的锌来满足情感。这将带来非常好的知识，因为这些成分创建了大脑细胞。你有B9那非常好，如果你有中风或者脑溢血，这个完美的线圈能够促使你的脑细胞再生。这是保罗带来的令人吃惊的礼物。</p>
<p>K: when you come back to Togo get in touch with me and I invite you to come to the African summit in Ghana. Bring your system and this knowledge. Benjamin are you on line? Is Dr. Ghatta from Kenya on line? Let me speak with Ghana. On Thursday morning we have the Ghana scientists with us and we ask them to replicate this and give us the full scientific measurement in the lab. This is absolutely beautiful for space technology.<br>凯史：当你回到多哥，与我联系，我要请你来非洲参加加纳的最高会议。带着你的系统和这些知识。本杰明，你在线吗？肯尼亚的Ghatta博士在线吗？让我们谈谈加纳。在周四的早上，加纳的科学家和我们，我们要求他们去复制这个。给我们提供完善的科学数据表格。这对于太空科技绝对是完美的。</p>
<p>K: Dr. Ghatta are you familiar with the soursop in Kenya?<br>凯史：Ghatta博士，你在肯尼亚熟悉刺番荔枝吗？</p>
<p>Dr.G: yes I know the fruit.<br>Ghatta博士：是的，我知道这种水果。</p>
<p>K: is it possible for us to have scientific research exactly if there is any paperwork in the scientific arena that allows us to see what they have done with this in the present science?<br>凯史：我们可能去精确的科学研究它，有没有科学领域的任何文件，,让我们看看目前的科学界做了些什么呢?<br>Dr.G: yes I have seen some papers and I will look for them.<br>Ghatta博士：是的，我看到过一些文件，我将继续收集它们。</p>
<p>K: please work with Paul in Togo and build up the scientific papers and I will ask people in Ghana to help us to scientifically validate it. It’s a nice and beautiful piece of information that explains how a little bit can go a long ways. Strangely enough if you look in the acidic part there is another game played here. Some of these acids are the ones that can penetrate the skin as we saw with the presentation by Ghana and what we saw with coconut and cocoa.<br>凯史：请与保罗在多哥协同工作，加强这个科学论文，我将要求在加纳的人们帮助我们去系统地验证它。这很好和美妙，说明一小块信息会使我们少走一大段弯路。说来也怪，如果你看氨基酸的内部，这里是另外的游戏场。某些氨基酸是唯一能够渗透皮肤的，就像我们看到在加纳展示的椰子和可可。</p>
<p>K: thank for the fantastic knowledge Paul. Please follow your patients and bring doctors in Togo to work with you so this is done scientifically. I know the African mentality—if they don’t feel anything they don’t go anywhere. But, try to get these people if there is a scientific record with X-rays and have them taken again.<br>凯史：谢谢保罗的奇异知识。请跟进你的病人的情况，并与多哥的医生一同工作来系统地完成这个。我知道非洲人的心理—如果他们感觉没有什么事情，他们不会去任何地方。但是，尝试获得这些人，如果这是一个X射线的科学系统的记录，他们将再次获得。</p>
<p>K: Dr. Rodrigo are you with us by any chance?<br>凯史：罗德里戈医生你听到我们说的吗？</p>
<p>Dr.R: yes I am here and I heard everything.<br>罗德里戈医生：是的，我听到所有事情。</p>
<p>K: can you see what can be done with the GANS of this on a nano-coated coil?<br>凯史：你看有什么甘斯可以用于这个纳米涂层线圈吗？</p>
<p>Dr.R: yes, I will try.<br>罗德里戈医生：是的，我将去尝试。</p>
<p>K: can you get this material in the US?<br>凯史：你在美国能够得到这些材料吗？</p>
<p>Dr. R: I don’t know the fruit.<br>罗德里戈医生：我不知道这种水果。</p>
<p>P: I can send it from Togo.<br>保罗：我可以从多哥寄给你。</p>
<p>K: in the US it is impossible. You have never been to the airport? You cannot bring things into the country. We have to test this in Africa and build it from there and outwards. Let’s see what we can do. I will try to find it here in the Africa shops and see how we can develop it. Thank you and have a safe trip.<br>凯史：在美国这是不可能的。你从没有去过机场？你不能带这些东西进入这个国家。我们在非洲测试这些，在这里建造，然后向外输送。让我们看看我们能够做什么。我将尝试去在这里的非洲商店里找到它，看看我们如何开发它。谢谢你，一路平安。</p>
<p>Dr.R: are the boards on the side of the person going have two lines of coils because the back one aligns to the spinal, or is there only one line on the side of the coils?<br>罗德里戈医生：在用于人体方面委员会是赞成有两条线的线圈，因为这与后面的脊柱对齐，还是只有一条线在这个线圈的一侧？</p>
<p>K: one line of coils on the side is good enough. The only thing is, on the head section do not use copper coils; only use zinc coils.<br>凯史：线圈的一条线就足够好了。唯一的事情是，在头部截面不可以用铜线圈。只能用锌线圈。</p>
<p>Dr. R: just on the top?<br>罗德里戈医生：只是在头部？</p>
<p>K: yes, please.<br>凯史：是的，请。</p>
<p>Dr. R: there is only one line on the side?<br>罗德里戈医生：在这一边只有一条线？</p>
<p>K: yes, please. This is the chamber in space and we talk about rooms which you can enter. This is a room in the structure. We are getting there slowly in production of the system that you can spend a few minutes inside and literally walk out without disease. We are just getting there slowly. This piece of information and the system that Klaus showed in Austria, we can fit any coil anywhere. If you have a cancer patient you put a coil with this material on it. If you have a different case you change it to what you need.<br>Thank you, we respect and thank you for your knowledge.<br>凯史：是的，请这么做。这是一个太空舱，我们谈论的你可以进入的房间。这是一个房间的结构。我们正在慢慢实现的系统，你可以在里面呆上几分钟，走出去以后，病就消失了。我们正在逐渐地实现它。这一块信息与克劳斯在澳大利亚展示的系统，我们可以适应任何线圈任何地方，如果你有癌症患者，你放一个线圈和这个材料在它上面，如果你有不同的情况，你按照你的需要去改变它。</p>
<p>K: it’s time to say goodbye…we had a good time and this was fantastic knowledge and we as humanity will benefit from it. Hopefully next Wednesday we will start agriculture.<br>凯史：是说再见的时候了……我们度过了一个美好的时光，这是奇异的知识，人类将从它获益。期待我们在下周三的农业教学再见。</p>
<p>R: this is the end of the 18th international knowledge seekers workshop.<br>瑞克：我们现在结束第18次知识寻求者教学。<br>（完）</p>
