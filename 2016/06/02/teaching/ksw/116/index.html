<p>in order to create motion and usable energy,as well to achieve objectives,rockets for example have to carry large and heavy payloads to fuel<br>为了制造运动和能量,或到达目标区域,火箭需携带又重又大的燃油补充机</p>
<p>which means that their payload dependent .Matter propulsion technology is very destructive,inefficient polluting and wasteful<br>这意味着火箭依靠物质推进技术低效造成污染及浪费</p>
<p>now let’s look at the new alternative , matter gravitational technology<br>现在新的替代技术来到我们面前,物质磁引力技术</p>
<p>mater gravitational technology uses the properties of the entirety of plasma to create motion lift and energy without destroying the characteristics of matter.<br>它运用了等离子体的属性进行运动飞升及能量制造,这个过程不会摧毁物质特性</p>
<p>00:10:05-00:11:00</p>
<p>The system utilizes this magnetic and gravitational field interaction to attain positioning and motion .Nothing is burned there is no waste and no pollution is created<br>通过使用磁引力场反应获得定位与运动,无需燃烧也不会产生浪费和污染</p>
<p>matter gravitational technology is efficient and not destructive<br>这项技术是高效和永续的</p>
<p>current human scientific achievement is the result of a progressive evolution science and technology over thousands of years Plasma technology is the next step in that evolution<br>目前人类科技成就是超过几千年来科学和技术革命进程的结果,等离子体科技是下一代技术变革,</p>
<p>it’s viable and it’s here today.You could be one of the first humans in space using plasma technology,.Apply today to the MOZAN training program<br>它存在我们生活中,并切实可行,你可以成为使用等离子体技术的太空第一人,现在就申请吧,参加我们的太空人培训计划,</p>
<p>00:11:00-00:12:00</p>
<p>Rick:Welcome everyone to the 116th knowledge seeker’s workshop is Keshe foundation spaceship institute ,and Jun 2 2016 as usual<br>R：欢迎大家来到凯史基金会太空飞船学院第116次知识寻求者网络教学,今天是2016年6月2日,像往常一样</p>
<p>we have Mr.Keshe with us as we have last 115th Knowledge seeker’s workshop as well as many more before and during that<br>凯史先生与我们一起展开教学,接上次115次的教学,正如此前的许多教学一样</p>
<p>I think it is ready to go with today is activity three of a few things like that as steven is explain still try to get a few things ready to go here .but it’s will be holiday .are you ready to go there Mr.Keshe,<br>看起来已经准备好今天的教学活动了,史蒂夫解释有几件事情也已经准备好了,但今天这里是假期,凯史先生,请问您准备好了吗？</p>
<p>K:Yes good morning good day to you as usual can you here me<br>K：是的 已准备好,早上好,上午好,正如往常一样,你可以听到吗？<br>R:Yes we can thank you<br>R：是的,我们可以 谢谢您<br>K;Good day to you as usual as I said ,whenever and wherever we listen to this teachings .First of all before we start, you hear the voices of Rich and Vince and every time here with me and today is the birthday for both of them .<br>K：上午好,如往常一样 不管什么时候,在哪里我们收听教学,在开始之前,朋友们可以听到文斯及瑞克的声音,他们俩一直与我一起做教学,今天是他们两位的生日</p>
<p>so happy birthday to both of you all the young man .we show a lot of happy years and thank you for being with Foundation for such a long time .How did you feel to be 16 Rick,.<br>生日快乐,两位年轻人,我们这些年经历了许多快乐的时光,感谢你们一直和凯史基金会一起,瑞克,16岁的感觉怎么样</p>
<p>R:it is good to feel 16,I thought it is 61 now,I have been shock by 60 but it is 16,It is amazing world that we living ,we are very happy<br>R：感觉不错 我以为是61了,听起来感到惊讶,后来发现是是16,我们生活在美妙的世界,我们感到很快乐</p>
<p>K,We will not going to ask to it because it is too sleepy to talk .The same goes to vince<br>K:我不打算进一步聊这个,因为它让人昏昏欲睡,同样的 生日快乐,文斯</p>
<p>R :you gets too ,a decade the horner today<br>R：您也是 数十年的荣誉归于您</p>
<p>00:13-00:14</p>
<p>Keshe (K): As part of teaching as we said will carry on in teaching the technological in new aspects in a way increasing the technical knowledge that evolving new systems and new directions in teaching. We are getting ready for the space excursion; there are a number of systems in the background and we are working<br>K：我们将把新的教学内容加进来 ,包括新系统与教学方向的调整,我们准备好太空探索 ,有许多系统在运作,</p>
<p>00:14-00:15</p>
<p>with a number of governments in the background with different aspects of the technology and private .<br>同时在背后我们与不同领域的政府机构一起工作</p>
<p>And in so many ways, as I said before it took some time for people to go from core to coils, and then from plasma to GANS,<br>此前我也常提到, 人们需要时间理解从内核到线圈及从等离子体到甘斯的理论</p>
<p>and now we expect that people who understood the technology are going to come up with new understanding of the fields.<br>我们也希望那些能够理解技术的人跟上新领域知识的学习</p>
<p>We see at the same time a number of people have understood the principle of the field plasma and now that we see the development we bring new understanding of the plasma aspects in space technology.<br>同时, 许多人已经能够理解等离子体场体原理, 并看到这些人对太空技术新的理解带来的发展.</p>
<p>Deep space technology means independence from this planet and knowing wherever you go in space you are safe<br>深空技术意味着人们可以从地球开始独立并知道要去太空中哪个地方</p>
<p>00:15-00:16</p>
<p>Irrespective of the position or of time in the life of the man and irrespective of the field strength across the universe.<br>不管目的地, 探索者的年龄和穿越宇宙时的场强 都能安全到达,</p>
<p>Man has evolved and been kept in a very safe nursery we called it the plan the earth. everything have done for us ,<br>人类一直被放在温室中进行保护,一切都为人类安排好了, 数千万年来 ,人类在这个星球一直被地球照顾和喂养,</p>
<p>We are protected, we are held on to and provided for and mother earth has nourished us for thousands of millions of years on this planet. In a way human race has become like a teenager who tries to go out and we can see if he can survive in the society.<br>也就是说人类已经成长为少年并尝试走出去, 看看人类是否能够在宇宙社区生存</p>
<p>This is where we are going and this is the (next) step of the man is to come to enter the universal community. We have been nourished and we have been looked after.<br>这是人类发展的下一步, 也就是融入整个宇宙社区,我们一直被喂养和照顾</p>
<p>00:16-00:17</p>
<p>We have been fed, protected and given the light, the energy and the heat and everything else that could guarantee the existence of man on this planet.<br>一直被保护, 给予光和能量, 每件事的存在是为了确保人类的生存</p>
<p>This is where the spaceship changes the position. Man has become a teenager and as usual becoming eighteen, given the key to the house as is the tradition in the English culture if you understand it<br>这是星球开始改变的位置的时候 ,人类已成长为少年, 已经18岁了, 可以把家里的钥匙交给他 如果你以英语文化去理解这个事情</p>
<p>that now you are an adult you can come home when you like and but you know what would you do you go outside and learn about the life in the society.<br>你已长大为成人, 可以依你喜好选择回家同时你知道应该要做些什么, 走出去在社会上学习怎样独立生活</p>
<p>The spaceship program is the key to a teenager who starts going out;<br>太空计划是人类少年走出地球的第一步</p>
<p>going out into space and knowing there is a home if he wants to come back but having enough training that outside in the wide world of space he can survive the whole<br>由此进入太空并且知道太空有家 ,如果他愿意他可以回家去,然而前提是人类得到足够训练以便能在太空世界任何环境中生存</p>
<p>00:17-00:18</p>
<p>good and bad and come home or at least make home wherever he likes and to feel safe and able to look after himself and his family.<br>或者能够回家, 至少能为他的家人及自己建造新的舒适家园</p>
<p>This has been part of the teaching of the Keshe Foundation Space Ship Institute: to teach how to do what you need to do and the way to do it and decide when you have a teenager at the age of 18 on the birthday<br>这一直是凯史基金会太空学院教学中的一部份,教授如何在太空中生存, 在太空中需要什么以及以什么方式去实现它,这由你在这位人类少年18岁生日的时候做决定</p>
<p>you start giving him the key to the car to be able for the teenage to start learning to drive and go out and travel around and come home safe.<br>给他车钥匙让他开始学习驾驶技术, 并且外出游历后仍能安全地回家</p>
<p>We give them keys, the car and instructions to teaching how to drive. We are in that stage—we are building the car, we have been given the car,<br>我们提供钥匙提供汽车以及驾驶技术 ,而目前正处于建造汽车的阶段,</p>
<p>00:18-00:19</p>
<p>we are giving the key to the car and now we are training from now on to teach how man to drive in the universal space ,<br>然后提供车钥匙, 现在我们开始培训人类如何在太空中驾驶这部汽车</p>
<p>in the universal space of this solar system, in the space of this planet, in the space of the galaxy and almost space of the universe.<br>在太阳系银河系及整个宇宙中驾驶这部汽车</p>
<p>It will take time to progress from one to another but we have laid the correct foundation for man to become the driver in space who can come back home safely<br>学习新技能需要花费些时日但凯史基金会带领人类走向正确的方向, 使人类在太空中成为合格的司机 能安全回家</p>
<p>or if he decides on 18 he wants to ‘move out of the house’ and find myself a new place and become independent and see new places.<br>就象18岁之后的少年打算离开家找到新的住所并开始独立</p>
<p>We have done this for millions of years and that is how we came from one tribe to another and as we moved out farther from the families we started to the cities and small villages,<br>我们为此准备了数千年, 在太空中如何从一个部落到另一个部落, 或者离家去往更远的地方, 启程去往城市 村庄及国家</p>
<p>00:19-00:20</p>
<p>countries and the rest. Now we start the excursion into space the same way and now it is for us to learn the rules of conduct of the space travel.<br>我们以同样的方式开始太空探索 ,是时候学习太空旅行行为准则了</p>
<p>It is for us to understand where to ‘tank’ fuel and which restaurant we need to stop for food and come back home.<br>学习哪里”加油”,哪个”服务站”中途休息补充能量和回家</p>
<p>But this time man has been to given the opportunity to be able to know how not only to drive the car but to build his own car, how to make his own food, how to make his own shelter<br>但这次人类不单驾驶汽车还建造汽车, 制作食物及他自己的移动家园</p>
<p>and as they did in the 60s when they became the hippies and the campers.<br>在60年代他们因此成为嬉皮士和背包客</p>
<p>Now we become space people who start camping across the universe and we need to have everything and be able to produce<br>现在我们开始在宇宙太空中成为背包客, 我们能够制造所有所需</p>
<p>00:20-00:21</p>
<p>what we need and not having to wait for the next fuel station or the next stop where we get food and water.<br>而不是等待在下个加油站加油和补充水份</p>
<p>The process of the Keshe Foundation teaching is not to enforce one path of thinking but opening different paths of thinking<br>凯史基金会网络教学的课程设计并非强迫一种思考方式而是打开不同的思考方式</p>
<p>so everyone can participate and bring their own knowledge and collectively as we gather knowledge together make it easier for the human race<br>因此人们可以参与进来, 把他们拥有的知识和经验分享给大家</p>
<p>collectively to find different ways of getting to space according to our intelligence and understanding and giving everyone the same chance.<br>在共同分享知识过程中人们发现知识的获得如此简单 ,另外不同的方式 ,在太空中根据人类不同的智能和理解力, 每个人都有同样的机会获得和分享知识</p>
<p>This is what we have achieved; we have gone across races, countries and every possible way and we cover every country on this planet<br>这是我们所到达的地方, 我们超越种族,国家及可能的方式,并且覆盖这个星球的所有国家</p>
<p>00:21-00:22</p>
<p>and no foundation or organization has achieved such penetration ever in the history of man in such a short time<br>在人类历史上, 没有任何一个基金会或组织能够在如此短的时间内达到这样的渗透程度</p>
<p>.It took Christ 300 years; it took Mohammed more than that. And because they used the belief of the man to control the soul of the man they got off balance<br>耶稣花了300年,默罕莫得花了更长时间,原因是他们利用人类信仰进行灵魂控制导致失去平衡</p>
<p>This time it is your soul and the soul of the man to decide there is no limit to conduct itself in space the correct way so man is not harmed and does not cause harm<br>这一次,由你的及人类自身灵魂来决定太空中不会有指令限制正确的方式,所以人类不会因此受到伤害</p>
<p>and not to take advantage of space as man has done on this planet but within the space and the fields of the universe that is welcoming and nourishing.<br>同时不再象以前利用地球那样利用太空,人类在太空的场域中受到欢迎和照顾</p>
<p>00:22-00:23</p>
<p>K: In so many ways we have to become part of the universal community. We have said this many times—the behavior of man has kept man from entering the universal community.<br>以如此多的方式使我们必须成为宇宙社区的一部分,我们曾多次说过,人类的行为阻止了人类进入宇宙社区</p>
<p>Now as we see internationally a large number of people have taken up the ethos of the Keshe Foundation trying to create peace among men and systems that make man independent of conditions that have brought man pain and suffering for centuries.<br>现在我们看到国际上很多人采用了凯史基金会的理念尝试在人和环境间创建和平， 使人类独立于蒙受苦难数世纪的旧有环境</p>
<p>When we can’t supply all the needs of the man, then man understands and changes his habits and with the comforts of having everything be changes the position it<br>当我们不能满足人类所有需求时 ，人类通过理解并改变自己的习惯， 使一切调整到舒适的位置</p>
<p>In being able to see clearly be change the position and the world.,<br>并能清晰地看到位置及世界的变化</p>
<p>00:23-00:24</p>
<p>In understanding the technology of how to survive and how to be peaceful, man is allowed to enter the universal community.<br>通过理解生存及和平相处的技术,人类被允许进入宇宙社区</p>
<p>As we saw in the last video, we are preparing the last stages for man to enter the space community.<br>正如最后一段视频中看到的， 我们正准备人类进入太空社区的最后阶段</p>
<p>But entering into the space community with a man who has been so violent for thousands and millions of years is not easy.<br>但与一个经历数千年暴力与战争的人一起进入太空社区是不容易的</p>
<p>We will see reactions and interactions but in time we will see the process of the healing of the man change his having the killing to peaceful actions.<br>我们会看到反应和互动， 同时我们将看到这个人的疗愈过程 ，改变他对和平行动的杀戮过程</p>
<p>So, in totality, one by one we have make this steps , part of you some of you are developing the space technology to make the ‘car’. Some of you are developing the food part<br>因此 ，在总体上， 我们采取逐步措施 部份人正在开发空间技术建造这部“汽车” 部份人正在开发食物</p>
<p>00:24-00:25</p>
<p>Some of you are developing the energy side and some of you are developing the material side and some are developing the health side.<br>部份人开发能源， 部份人开发材料， 部份人开发医疗系统</p>
<p>So collectively we are working one direction. Some may look strange and some may look too farfetched with others but it is working.<br>总的来说,我们都在同一个方向,有些可能看起来很奇怪,有些可能看起来很是不着边际,但这些都正在工作</p>
<p>Gradually in next three to six months, we will see millions of the human race will start working that direction.<br>逐渐地在未来三到六个月,我们将看到数以百万计的人投入这个方向进行实验研究</p>
<p>We have made the ‘ground’ ready and the knowledge has been spreader. We see our teaching us coming from all corners of this planet to share knowledge freely.<br>我们准备好了“基础” 并且教导正在蔓延,我们看到这个星球上各个角落的知识寻求者自由地分享知识,</p>
<p>And freely shared ,and this has never been done; we became thread to multinationals we became thread to those who structured the world to be busy with wars that they could be what we call take advantage of it.<br>这在人类历史上从没出现过， 我们对跨国公司形成威胁 ，对那些造成整个世界忙于战争的人形成威胁， 这些人利用战争达到自己的目的</p>
<p>00:25-00:26</p>
<p>And now we see, they see the Keshe Foundation which is Europe as a thread and in a way we don’t need us anymore.<br>我们看到凯史基金会被视为一个威胁， 在某种程度欧洲不需要我们了</p>
<p>We see a number of scientific and influential groups turning towards the foundation in a very tentative way to start working and understanding,<br>我们看到一些科学家和有影响力的群体开始转向基金会尝试理解和实验这个理论</p>
<p>maybe to be with us or maybe to find a way to penetrate to disturb the flow that they could carry on the behavior of the past<br>或者与我们一起或者找到一个方式去渗透或干扰他们所持有的旧有理论体系</p>
<p>I give you one warning that is the knowledge has spread so much that there is no camping on either side<br>我给你一个警告 知识的范围已经扩散到任何一方都没有阵营</p>
<p>There is only one camping for human race to go forward. We received communication from a number of these organizations in different ways,<br>人类只有一个阵营前进,我们以不同的方式接收到大量不同机构的沟通</p>
<p>and they have been accused that they have penetrated to the Keshe Foundation at different ways to control it.<br>他们被指控用不同的方式对凯史基金会进行渗透以便得到控制权,</p>
<p>00:26-00:27</p>
<p>The control of the Keshe Foundation is not in the hand of one man or one nation; it is in the hands of humanity.<br>凯史基金会不是控制在一个人或一个民族手中 ，它属于全人类</p>
<p>So, what we hear, what we see and what communication we receive, we have become unpenetrable because the people who done their jobs for past centuries control with war and economic, now they are part of the colony of the Keshe Foundation.<br>过去几个世纪被战争和经济控制的人， 现在成为凯史基金会的一部分， 因此 ，我们所听所看到和所接收到的 ，使我们成为坚不可摧的机构,</p>
<p>We are touching them, but not as one place, one man, but across the planet<br>我们正在触动他们的心灵， 但不是作为一个区域， 一个人 ，而是通过整个星球</p>
<p>You are building the Magrav systems,you are building the health systems,the GANS plasma systems for health and you are thousands and millions of you across this planet.<br>你是这个星球上千千万万中的一员， 正在建造能量系统 ，卫生系统， 甘斯等离子体医疗系统</p>
<p>Up till now they had a target and now the target is spread, they became but minority.<br>到现在为止， 他们有一个目标 ，现在的目标正在传播 ，他变成少数派</p>
<p>But this still old habits will go trying to being control that they could have something,‘crumbs from this cake’. But this cake is intact.<br>但人类这些旧习惯仍试图去控制 ，他们可以有一些“蛋糕屑”,但这个蛋糕是完整的</p>
<p>00:27-00:28</p>
<p>We see the human race going for forward with what we see as peace and the beginning of a beautiful relationship between men among themselves with sharing knowledge<br>我们看到人类之间通过同时共享知识形成美妙的关系 从而往和平前进</p>
<p>but at the same time, not having those who would like to be as leaders as they call themselves.<br>没有谁想成为领导人， 他们自称为自己人</p>
<p>We are all equal in sharing knowledge and we share it beautifully and the more and more of you establishing different approaches, paths and avenues into the Keshe Foundation, the stronger it will become,<br>知识的共享使人人平等， 以这样的方式分享越多， 建立起越多联系， 越多方法及途径， 凯史基金会变得越强</p>
<p>Diversity is the strength of the Keshe Foundation—diversity in knowledge, sharing knowledge and the way we have go and,growing across the planet has become our strength.<br>多样性是凯史基金会的力量， 知识多样性， 共享知识及我们在这个星球的经历及成长过程变成了我们的优势</p>
<p>00:28-00:29</p>
<p> We are on the verge of man into traveling into space, on the principle of the space what we call technical knowledge, the work of the universe and without damaging the universal condition.<br>我们正处于进入人类太空旅行时代的边缘， 在太空旅行原则上， 太空技术知识应用在宇宙中而不破坏宇宙环境,</p>
<p>But ,as I said, in the coming time, very soon, once we achieve given numbers including the governments<br>但是， 正如我所说， 很快， 在接下来的时间里， 一旦我们达到既定目标， 包括政府的数目</p>
<p>who have part of the technology, but with the food then we will give to access to the universal community<br>他们能掌握一部份技术及食物 ，我们便会释放进入宇宙社区的访问权</p>
<p>We know we can mention nation by nation which have made contact and approaches and have been tried for past few decades agrees to develop this space technology<br>我们可以跟大家逐个报出这些国家名， 我们跟他们已经取得了联系， 并在过去的几十年里达成协议同意发展这一空间技术</p>
<p>00:29-00:30</p>
<p>which they have been given to was due to the conduct having been withheld the final pieces. The final pieces will be given en masse so that no nation or country will be any different.<br>我们给他们提供了技术,这些技术因指令阻止， 最后一部份将同步释放以确保没有国家或地区存在差异</p>
<p>In traveling to China with the help of the Chinese government supporting the Keshe Foundation, we will open the space technology with the leadership of President Xi that the nation stays peaceful, the man becomes peaceful.<br>我们将去到中国 在中国政府协助下建立凯史基金会并在习近平主席领导下开放太空技术 这个国家处于和平的状态时 国民也是和平的</p>
<p>This is a gift from us to humanity. In so many ways we look into the other world leaders to join step by step,<br>这是人类的礼物,我们用许多方式去和不同领导人沟通， 他们逐步加入我们</p>
<p>but we have now collectively we can add to the knowledge of man that we have given you the tools you need to learn the methods and you need to understand more and more.<br>现在我们可以共同把人类知识加进来， 我们提供你们这个工具， 现在你需要学会这个方法并理解越来越多的方法,</p>
<p>00:30-00:31</p>
<p>I said that gradually my teaching will come to an end because I created a condition where you, the knowledge seekers and the teachers of the knowledge seekers and in every language we will start teaching.<br>我说过我的教学将结束， 因为我创造了一个条件， 你， 知识寻求者和知识寻求者的教师将开始在每一种语言的教学</p>
<p>We have reached that watershed. We have seen the Italians, Germans, French, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and you name it, you are doing it.<br>我们已经达到分水岭,我们看到了意大利人、德国人、法国人、西班牙人、中国人、日本人以及通过你的命名你正在做这些事情</p>
<p>So my job as a teacher has more or less is coming to an end and I will step down very soon.<br>我作为一名教师的工作即将结束 我很快就会退休</p>
<p>In the coming time when I am ready for space and when we put the man face to face when what I call with the creatures of the space that we will create the friendship handshake across humanity with the universal community,<br>在即将到来的时间 面对太空当我们准备好的时候， 当我们准备把人类与造物主面对面时 ，人类与宇宙社区将握手坐下来建立友谊</p>
<p>00:31-00:32</p>
<p>And set down because I have achieved my goal but in that process, we have to understand one thing—we have to change our needs of war, and war mongering and destroying to achieve to have.<br>这时我实现了我的目标， 但在这一过程中， 我们必须明白一件事， 我们必须改变我们对战争的需要和战争买卖</p>
<p>In the next three to six months we will achieve this due the aliens and supporters we have made you and you correct come down.<br>在未来三到六个月内 我们将实现这一目标， 由于外星人和支持者们使我们走向正确的方向</p>
<p>We will see the number of nations will become one nation. And gradually everything has been made ready for this over centuries.<br>我们将看到逐渐地许多国家成为一个国家 ，一切都为这一刻准备了几个世纪</p>
<p>Now it makes sense to bring it . and we have united the states. 50 states or 50 nations each one economic powerful for themselves in their way and made one nation out of part of one continent.<br>现在是时候把和平带来 ，我们已经团结了美国 50个州或50个国家 每一个以他们自己的方式壮大经济使其摆脱这块大陆</p>
<p>00:32-00:33</p>
<p>We have seen the connection of the Europeans together as the European community. We see the African nations on the same path.<br>我们已经看到欧洲共同体和欧洲共同体的联系,我们看到非洲国家在同一条道路上</p>
<p>We see the Asian continent joining the same. Our job as Keshe Foundation is to make one nation out of all these groups. And we are achieving it very rapidly.<br>我们看到亚洲大陆加入其中， 凯史基金会的工作把这些国家从不同的组织分离现来 我们正以非常快的速度实现它</p>
<p>And then you understand to make one planet, one nation, one race, the work has already been done. It is just bringing the last pieces together that we bring the trust and unity.<br>然后你明白 ，一个星球 ，一个国家， 一个种族的理念可以把工作做完 ，它只是把最后一块大陆加进来， 通过信任和团结联合在一起</p>
<p>We see in the news in the past 48 hours that the Russians and the Chinese have settled in the compel of peace<br>我们看到在过去的48小时内， 俄罗斯和中国已经解决了强制和平问题</p>
<p>that if there is anything is done for united states against Russia or China they release all the papers and dump the economy of the United States.<br>如果任何事情美国都和俄罗斯或中国对着干， 中国将释放所有的文件击溃美国经济</p>
<p>00:33-00:34</p>
<p>It means that China has taken the leadership of peace, the stock with almost of your assets now we dictate the peace conditions.<br>这意味着中国已经开始领导世界走向和平， 几乎你的所有资产及股票由和平条件所控制</p>
<p>And this is why we sit with the Chinese. Because the peaceful behavior brings peaceful reactions.<br>这就是为什么我们和中国坐一起， 因为和平的行为带来和平行动</p>
<p>In so many ways us as Keshe Foundation has been given all the opportunities is for us to the development of the technology and the delivery of the technology to change the position to bring the last of pieces together.<br>在很多方面我们作为凯史基金会已提供所有机会发展技术并教授技术给他们， 从而改变最后一块大陆的位置带来整体的融合,</p>
<p>The jigsaw is already on the table. All the pieces need the connection and when the picture is at the together at connection to each other, the beauty of looking at this picture is the united of mankind<br>拼图已经放在桌上了， 所有碎片都需要连接， 当画面连接在一起的时候， 通过这些连接我们看到这张照片是人类统一的美丽</p>
<p>00:34-00:35</p>
<p>And with it the prize which is the opening of the universal community to man<br>及伴随宇宙社区向人类开放的奖赏</p>
<p>. Is it worth it to have bigger space to look and travel and learn more from the men of space than to fight for a piece of land which is worth nothing when the physical life of the man is over?<br>拥有更大探索和旅行空间并从太空中学习更多是否比争取一块没有价值土地的更有价值， 而争夺土地的生命却很快会死去？</p>
<p>So, as we done before, we do the game we put the hand of peace across the table as we did with Iran and the American nation some years ago and which we led to the peace talks between Iran and the United States.<br>我们熟知如何带来和平， 就像几年前伊朗和美国一样， 我们把和平的手放在桌子上， 领导了伊朗和美国之间的和平谈判,</p>
<p>Now we put the hand of peace across to the nations to all the world leaders that we give you time but we dictate on the path.<br>现在我们把和平的手放向所有世界领导人， 我们给你时间， 但我们控制进程,</p>
<p>We have the tools, technology and the manpower of<br>我们有工具、技术和支持凯史基金会数以千计的人力资源</p>
<p>00:35-00:36</p>
<p>Thousands of Keshe Foundation supporters to deliver step by step. At the moment we came from the center core of the fuel.<br>此刻,我们是来自燃料中心的核心</p>
<p>Now there are thousands and each one of you is adding different parts to this mosaic of the beautiful creatures of this planet which is mankind and the rest of all .<br>成千上万的人每个人都往这块拼图添加不同部分,是这个拥有美丽生物星球的拼图,包括了人类和其它所有生物</p>
<p>I have been told there are people creating divisions in the opening different parts in the different name of the Foundation.<br>有人告诉我 有人建了不同的分支， 以不同的名字命名基金会</p>
<p>Why not—it is your freedom. As long as you carry the ethos of the Foundation that whatever to do is to bring peace to humanity,<br>为什么不？这是你的自由， 只要你坚持凯史基金会的精神 ，只要是给人类带来和平我们不管你做什么</p>
<p>Open as many websites for Keshe Foundation family, teachings, children, agriculture in different languages and whatever you like. The more you do the more beautiful colors of the table brought in the top.<br>以不同的语言建立尽可能多的凯史基金会网站家族， 涵盖教学 ，儿童教学 ，农业任何你喜欢的领域 ，你做得越多桌上拼图的颜色越漂亮</p>
<p>00:36-00:37</p>
<p>There is no dictatorship or leadership is us to guide each other and whatever we do leads us to one thing and that is the indication of mankind world peace we give you the tools of it .<br>在这里没有独裁或领导者，我们互相指导， 无论我们做什么 ，引导我们只有一件事 就是人类世界和平 这是我们给你的工具</p>
<p>We see better and we act better. And that’s what I said from the beginning, part of the development of the space technology is not the physical reactors;<br>我们看到越来越好 我们表现得越来越好,这就是我们最初提到的 对航空技术发展的部分</p>
<p>It is not the Magrav units, not the health units, or growing bigger lettuce and cleaning the waters of the rivers of Africa.<br>并不是物理反应堆；也不是能量单元 不是医疗单位 或长得更大的生菜和治理污染的非洲河流</p>
<p>It is with to with this process you’ve been bring peace to humanity.<br>正是这个过程中 你给人类带来了和平</p>
<p>We start learning and teaching and it is beautiful to learn from everywhere, every nationality what you call yourself by what common language the peace and the soul of the man.<br>我们开始学习和教学 来自世界各地的知识寻求者一起学习是件美妙的事情 ，来自每一个说同一语言的民族以和平灵魂参与学习,</p>
<p>00:37-00:38<br>So, From now on, we don’t go so much into seeing and developing systems. We have done, we have achieved the point that man cannot understand any further. .<br>因此， 从现在起 ，我们不去看到和开发系统 我们已经做了， 我们已经到达了人类智能所能理解的最深远处,</p>
<p>At this moment in time, even reaching in the field plasma, we have reached the pinnacle science for man. And now we know the point we have to achieve and we have to fill in the picture.<br>此时此刻我们甚至到达等离子场体中， 这已经达到了科学的顶峰 ，现在我们知道必须实现这点 ，我们也必须填满这张照片</p>
<p>Some of you will bring different methods and some of you will develop different methods. It is for different applications and none of you is wrong.<br>你们中的一些人会带来不同的方法， 另外一些人会开发不同的方法， 它针对不同的应用程序 没有一个是错误的</p>
<p>You put the double coil together, the GANS together, the nano-material together—they have all come through the teachings of the Keshe Foundation.<br>你把双层线圈放在一起， 把甘斯放在一起， 把纳米材料放在一起， 他们都来自凯史基金会的教学</p>
<p>None of you have brought anything new on the table but you have brought the knowledge of mankind on the table.<br>谁也没有带来新的东西放到桌子上,但大家带来了人类的知识放在桌子上</p>
<p>00:38-00:39</p>
<p>So those who try to claim they control this, or they have this and they have the decision-making of the country or nation or whatever,<br>因此， 那些试图声称他们控制这个技术 ，对国家决策或整个国家或任何其它事情具有控制权</p>
<p>shows the lack of understanding of the teaching and you are getting lost the game in the same process of mankind those against direction in understanding of the totality of world by the foundation. .<br>显示了他对教学理解的缺乏， 你又在同一游戏中失败了 ，这是对基金会引领人类同一进程方向上的理解,</p>
<p>If winding a couple of pieces of wire makes you the leader, if you stacking the coils which we show you, makes you ahead ,let it be, it means you have no knowledge and no understanding of the work of humanity.<br>如果绕几根线可以使你成为领导者 或把线圈叠起来使你成为“头” 这意味着你没有足够知识 也没有对人类和平工作的理解</p>
<p>Put as many systems, amalgamations of systems, bring the Gans and the plasma, bring the field plasma, bring the nanotechnology,bring the matter technology together<br>把尽可能多的系统， 合并系统， 甘斯等离子体， 等离子体场体、纳米技术、物质技术整合在一起</p>
<p>00:39-00:40</p>
<p>and use the beauty of it for man to achieve peace and enter the condition to be able to be the teenager to have the keys to be able to go for an excursion on his own..<br>用它的美丽为人类实现和平及形成那样的条件以使青少年获得独立旅行的钥匙</p>
<p>It is very easy to get lost but if you have good beacons of light you can always find the way back home.And this is our job.<br>在这个过程中很容易迷路但如果前方灯塔永亮你便可找到回家的路 ,而这正是我们的职责所在</p>
<p>I have explained many times that how we can change things and how we can allow more and more people to access the technology.<br>鄙人已解释多次， 何以改变世间万物， 又如何吸引更多同道者学习技术</p>
<p>We have come to the point to extend knowledge , today we go to Ghana if we have the ???? Ghanaian Keshe Foundation Benjamin and the Ghana Atomic Commission has done<br>我们已经到了扩展知识的地方 ,今天我们要去加纳, 本杰明在加纳凯史基金会, 加纳原子能委员会在背后做了</p>
<p>00:40-00:41</p>
<p>a lot of work in the background. We will see a new material and a new approach today developed by again African developing nuclear center or atomic center ,<br>大量支持工作,今天, 我们将看到再次由非洲核原子中新研发的新材料和新方法<br>Today I teach you something new—how you can understand the technology in a very, very easy way.<br>今天我教你一些新的东西 你可以用非常简单的方式理解这个技术</p>
<p>It has been on the table but none of you ever stood still to listen to what I said. Go back to the beginning of the teaching,<br>它一直拿到桌面上在讲 但没有人听我说</p>
<p>go back to the very first time ,the very first videos we made about making nano-materials and the GANS.Fabio,is it possible to have the white board please.<br>回到教学的起点 ,回到最初的视频 ,我们制作纳米材料和甘斯的第一个视频,法比澳 ,请帮忙显示下白板 ,谢谢你</p>
<p>00:41-00:42</p>
<p>in so many ways, if we go back to the position of understanding the very first teachings, you will understand what we are teaching in the last teachings in the two three weeks has only been always on the table.<br>也就是说, 如果我们回去理解第一个教学 ,你会明白我们过去两三周教学上所教的一直在桌面上,</p>
<p>It is us who looks but deep enough. But so was in front that the knowledge was not understood.<br>我们了解这些知识但不够深入 ,从另外的角度来说, 知识没有被理解</p>
<p>Let’s look at two things let’s go back on very original teaching: you have the matter and you have the nano-materials. We said and we have shown many times very original pictures videos which Keshe Technology<br>让我们来看两件事情, 回到最初的教学, 你有物质有纳米材料,我们已经多次在原始图片和视频上展示了凯史技术</p>
<p>00:42-00:43</p>
<p> put on the internet 8 and 10 years ago, carry a very beautiful collection of different materials with the diamond tester which showed the behavior of every material.<br>这些图片和视频8-10年前放在互联网上， 用钻石检测仪可观察到不同材料美丽的结构 显示出每种材料的行为<br>If you can find it on the internet, you see different materials using the tester shows the behavior of the diamond. So we already know how to make crystals, diamond crystals.<br>如果你能在互联网上找到这些视频可以看到不同材料在测试仪下显示出钻石的行为 ,那么我们已知如何制造钻石及水晶钻石</p>
<p>Because diamond crystals come only when a specific configuration is achieved. With the balance light in rejection and acceptance of the field is created.So what we do in the matter state with the nano-materials which we have today<br>在特定的配置下可以制造出钻石， 通过创造场体形成吸收和释放的平衡， 那么我们今天在下用顶部黑色的纳米材料物质状态来做什么？</p>
<p>00:43-00:44</p>
<p>With the dark color on top of the nano-layers, we only are looking in,we are not looking across.<br>我们只是从这样的方式去看</p>
<p>并不是横着看</p>
<p>If you have a chance to look, not this way where you see the darkness because all the rays are absorbed, (not above at an angle but above looking straight down) but look this way and you will see the most beautiful crystal structures man ever known.<br>如果你以这样的方式看 ，（不是角度而是从上往下直线看）而不是横着看 你看到黑色的一层因为所有的射线被吸收， 但以横着方式看， 你会看到人类已知最美的水晶结构</p>
<p>That is why when you put the tools which you know we see 20 M? (mega-ohm) but this way (from top to bottom)<br>这就是为什么当你使用检测工具时看到20（兆欧电阻） 但这种方式（从上往下看）</p>
<p>but this way (along the Nano-layer) you see super conductivity and this is the behavior of perfect crystals, this is the behavior of creating perfect crystals.<br>但以这种方式看（沿着纳米涂层）， 你看到超导性， 这是完美晶体的结构， 这样创造了完美晶体,</p>
<p>So, now you understand how to produce crystals; you already been there but you did not see the knowledge. Go back on the extension of the knowledge; the way we spoke about using composites.<br>所以， 现在你知道如何产生水晶， 你已知道怎样做， 但你没有理解知识， 回到知识的扩展处， 我们谈论使用复合材料的方式,</p>
<p>00:44-00:45<br>If you still use composites dues path in different materials, you created bigger and smaller spacing in use layers of Nano-materials.<br>若你仍用不同的材料制作复合材料,你便能创造纳米材料层中更大和更小间距</p>
<p>Then you understand you can make this basic in the light space gravitational magnetic field positioning and with it now you can decide the size of the crystal<br>然后你就明白了， 你可以通过空间内部光的磁引力场定位制作它的基础 ，由此你可以决定晶体的大小</p>
<p>.Because each one of these takes a position in the crystal, with spacing perfect, the structure perfect .<br>因为每一个基础在水晶中都有位置 ，间距完美， 结构完美</p>
<p>now you see it is in your hand you already all have been crystal makers, perfect crystals.<br>现在你看到它在你手中 ，你已经成为所有不同水晶类型的制造商， 完美的晶体</p>
<p>00:45-00:46</p>
<p>The crystals you made a nano-layers because it is so thin you don’t have the tools to see are they most perfect crystals man has ever made<br>这样你做了一个纳米涂层晶体， 但因为它太薄你不需要用工具来检测它们是不是人类有史以来最完美的晶体</p>
<p>Because it is made by allowing the nature to do what it is happy with to do without any damage but taking the position it likes.<br>因为它是在大自然快乐的情绪下制造的 ，不会有任何伤害 ，而是以它喜欢的位置产生出来</p>
<p>Now if you understood this, those of you who have been looking to make perfect crystals missed another point. Don’t forget one thing: you put this nano-material (liquid) into liquid of another field strength and you placed it and released it as a GANS.<br>现在如果你明白， 当你一直在尝试制作完美晶体时忘了一点， 忘了你把这种纳米材料（液体）放到另一个场强中</p>
<p>你把它放在里面并作为甘斯释放它</p>
<p>00:46-00:47</p>
<p>If you understand now that in creating a condition to go from attachment to freedom<br>现在如果你明白 ，创造一个条件去把附着的涂层自由的释放出来</p>
<p>you can create a condition where you can bring the freedom of the material in the spacing themselves correctively in the correct way, you can create any crystal size.<br>你可以创建一个条件， 用正确的方式把材料之间的材料之间的物质自由的释放出来， 你可以创建任何晶体尺寸</p>
<p>Now you have to look for a medium to be able not to let them loose to become the GANS, but create a condition that in becoming loose they found the position—<br>现在你要找一个介质不让他们松散变成甘斯 但创造一个条件变得松散让它们自行定位</p>
<p>you can have a diamond the size of a planet.<br>他们发现你可以有一个钻石大小的行星</p>
<p>We have seen the diamond structures in the universe. There are stars which behave and are the same structure as crystal diamond<br>.我们看到了宇宙中的钻石结构 ，星星的结构和水晶钻研结构相同</p>
<p>it has been ordered by NASA years ago.<br>它已由美国航空航天局几年前订购</p>
<p>00:47-00:48</p>
<p>Now you understand the space of the universe allows crystallization in the dimension.<br>现在你明白宇宙空间允许在维度中结晶</p>
<p>It is the matter and the combination of the matter which you use dictates the spacing.<br>它由物质与你使用的物质之间间距所决定</p>
<p>Now you understand how you all being building crystal perfect crystals and you have been releasing it.<br>现在你明白如何制造完美水晶 你已释放这项技术</p>
<p>but now you have to develop the technology where you can control this freedom don’t let them loose by collect them as GANS but collected as crystals of the GANS.<br>但你需要发展这个技术 ，有效控制材料自由释放 ，不要让它们松散收集成甘斯而是收集成晶体甘斯</p>
<p>This is the space crystal structure. Then you can decide to make any material in the space by controlling the fields.<br>这是空间晶体结构 ，然后你可以通过控制场体在空间中制造任何材料</p>
<p>Lets’ add to the knowledge further more. Go back to what we talked about your CO2 box.<br>让我们进一步增加知识， 回到我们谈论到的二氧化碳制造盒子</p>
<p>00:48-00:49</p>
<p>The CO2 box which I developed and you followed and a lot of you every day to make the GANS is the operation of the universe. None of you understood.<br>我设计二氧化碳制造盒子让你每天忙于生产甘斯， 而其实这是宇宙的造物过程 ，只是没有人明白</p>
<p>Too busy to see matter that the world of the matter of the man blinded the man. Let’s open the knowledge; go back to when you make the CO2 Gans.<br>忙于物质的人类世界蒙蔽了人类的眼睛,让我们打开知识范围 回到你生产CO2甘斯时</p>
<p>You put the nano-coated copper and you put the zinc plate and then you immersed it in the water of the salt.<br>你把纳米涂层的铜， 锌板 ，浸入盐水中</p>
<p>Go back to the teaching and understand what I continuously emphasized but a lot of you were too busy to look at the CO2.<br>回到教学， 并理解我一直强调的 ，但你们都忙于物质而忘记了二氧化碳甘斯</p>
<p>00:49-00:50</p>
<p>If you remember go back on the teaching what we said, the gravitational magnetic fields which is created by the nano-material in respect to matter state created the field of carbon ,<br>如果你记得我们教过的， 物质状态下的纳米材料碳场体制造了磁引力场</p>
<p>where this field of carbon attract gravitational magnetic field which now you have created here has made the magnet for the carbon in the space around the system to attract it to comes in to match up.<br>现在你通过碳磁力的吸引制造了磁引力场， 使碳围绕系统形成磁力吸收相应的能量创造了磁场</p>
<p>And in that process in the coming in touch with oxygen of the water create your CO2<br>并通过接触水中的氧制造二氧化碳甘斯</p>
<p>00:50-00:51</p>
<p>Understand the terminology, we did not create CO2 absorption, go back to the teaching,<br>去了解术语， 我们并没有创建二氧化碳的吸收， 回到最初教学</p>
<p>we created gravitational magnetic field of carbon by choosing the appropriate materials which the division and difference in some of the isotopes lead to creation of the environment which has gravitational magnetic fields of an entity.<br>而是通过选择合适的材料创建了碳磁引力场， 其中一些同位素的分裂及差异促使磁引力场环境实体的创造</p>
<p>In this case the precise choice of the matter, the nano-material and the matter just give you enough to create the strength of the fields of carbon.<br>在这种情况下材料的精确选择， 纳米材料及物质能提供足够创造碳磁场的强度</p>
<p>So what do we talk about in the past two three weeks?<br>那么， 我们在过去的两三个星期里谈论了什么？</p>
<p>00:51-00:52</p>
<p>Field plasma technology. You have already created the plasmatic field,<br>是等离子场体技术，您已经创建了等离子场体</p>
<p>because the plasmatic field you created led to the creation of gravitational and magnetical field in the strength of the carbon which attracted anyone passing by.<br>因为你创造的等离子磁场促使碳的场强吸收任何经过磁引力场的能量</p>
<p>What you collected the CO2 is what this falls on the bottom.<br>然后二氧化碳甘斯沉在底部</p>
<p>But this field never changed, what you see after a while is system doesn’t work anymore, you don’t produce that much anymore,<br>但这个场永远不会改变 一段时间后这系统不工作了， 生产不了那么多甘斯</p>
<p>because the reason being is not the field that has changed, you have consumed all the oxygen which was in the water.<br>并不是场体改变了而是消耗了水中所有氧气</p>
<p>That is why your process stops. This field never changed. Your change all field oxygen into this container and you will get CO2 for the rest of life to come.<br>这就是为什么甘斯生产停止了,这个场体从未改变,盒子中所有氧气都改变然后会得到另一种生命形态的二氧化碳甘斯</p>
<p>00:52-00:53</p>
<p>So understand you have already worked with diamond and you‘ve already been creating the most perfect diamond in universe in your Nano-layers<br>所以明白你已经与钻石一起工作， 并且在纳米涂层中创造了宇宙中最完美的钻石</p>
<p>and now you have the knowledge, you were too busy looking at it to land in the bottom where you already, all of you, have been working with the field plasma.<br>而现在你有了知识， 但你忙着看它的底部， 此时， 所有人包括你一直都与等离子场体一起</p>
<p>We went into detail how that field plasma of carbon is created even if you put copper with copper, how it is created that it allows the fields to flow.<br>我们深入研究碳原子的等离子场体是如何产生的， 它是如何被创建的并能够在场体中流动， 我们甚至用了铜片与铜片的组合</p>
<p>Now all you understand all of you from the beginning have been in the diamond business and all of you have been in the field business.<br>现在你明白所有人从一开始就和钻石在一起， 所有人都处在那个场体中</p>
<p>Now let’s take this step further let’s go<br>现在让我们从这里开始往前进一步 我们走</p>
<p>00:53-00:54</p>
<p>and add to the knowledge a little bit more. It’s very simple. Bring the understanding of the crystals, Bring the understanding of the GANS material and now put an entity in the middle which has nothing but has the field of the plasma of carbon<br>来再加上一点知识,这个非常简单,现在把一个材料放到这个盒子中， 把对晶体的认识对甘斯材料的理解加进去,里面什么也没有只有碳等离子场体</p>
<p>and you create magnetic gravitational fields where now you can and you have the ability to use the fields to create the crystals. I see Giovanni’s mouth opening. This is the truth that all of you now understanding the technology in more depth<br>然后你创造了磁引力场， 这时你拥有了用场体创造晶体的能力,我看见乔凡尼张开了口,这是这项技术的真相 现在所有人都更明白了</p>
<p>00:54-00:55</p>
<p>and now you bring everything together. So, if you understood this if you understand this principle and you can follow the principle, all of you can make any diamond, any size and color, the size of your container.<br>现在你把一切连接一起,所以， 如果你明白这一原则便可以遵循它， 所有人都可以制作任何大小和颜色的钻石， 根据你的需求你容器大小而定</p>
<p>Would you like a 2 carat or a 2000 carat diamond? I give my biggest condolences to the diamond bursars of the world. The total cost to make such a diamond is less than 5 cents.<br>你想要一个2克拉还是2000克拉的钻石？我给我的财务主管的世界上最大的钻石,制造这样一颗钻石的总成本不到5美分</p>
<p>I used to be a diamond dealer and I broke my own business. That is why I moved away from that business because I realized what I had developed and what I had in my hand was worth nothing.<br>我曾经是一个钻石交易商， 我经营自己的事业， 这就是为什么我离开这一行业， 因为我意识到最终发展的问题， 我手上的东西是没有价值的</p>
<p>00:55-00:56</p>
<p>When you are looking for a carats of diamonds that I can make ,1000 carats .<br>当你在寻找某些克拉的钻石， 我可以做一个1000克拉的钻石</p>
<p>If you understand this sooner or later Europe will start producing diamonds crystals like nothing.<br>如果你明白你就会知道， 欧洲迟早会开始生产钻石和水晶一样</p>
<p>I have seen the innovation center in Philippines is on the process but they have not understood it fully; they are on the path . but you are not very far,<br>我看到菲律宾创新中心正在进程中， 他们还没有完全理解 但离得不远</p>
<p>you have a beautiful team in Philippines run by Renan and Bernie and others and. Douglas in the US and others will join soon.<br>美好的菲律宾团队由勒南和伯尼带领， 美国团队的道格拉斯及其他人将很快加入</p>
<p>Now you can produce crystals which carry unified, uniform fields and you understand exactly where does this lead to.<br>现在你可以在统一场体内用统一的形式生产钻石， 你清楚地懂得这将导向的方向</p>
<p>00:56-00:57</p>
<p>If you understand this, then you can extend the size, shape and dimension of the crystal ,go back into my teaching.<br>如果你明白这一点， 那么你可以扩展钻石的大小形状和尺寸， 回到我的教学</p>
<p> I always said that the future of the spaceship program depends on the crystallization, on the crystals and now you understand why.<br>我总是说， 未来太空飞船计划取决于晶体化， 在于晶体化， 现在你明白为什么</p>
<p>You make your reactor out of one crystal. Then what you have is mono-controllable and if you understand further you would see the 3-crystal star formation below with one above.<br>你从晶体中制造出反应器， 那么你有了一个单控制反应器 ，如果进一步理解你会有一个底部三个加顶部一个的星体组合反应器,</p>
<p>00:57-00:58</p>
<p>They are unified and never lost, but the positioning of your crystals has to be the crystal itself.<br>它们是统一的， 永远不会丢失能量， 你水晶的定位必须是水晶本身</p>
<p>Then you decide the shape, the color and the strength of the what you call is your ambition to create unified field protection which to you would like to call it the spaceship.<br>你具有建立一个统一保护场的野心 ，然后你决定这个保护场的形状颜色以及强度， 你喜欢称之为太空船</p>
<p>00:58-00:59</p>
<p>Now the race for space is getting hotter. Now you understand how simply in 10 minutes I changed the course of humanity… if humanity understands what is on that board.<br>现在， 太空竞赛越来越热了， 现在你明白这个技术多么简单 ，10分钟内我改变了人类的进程路线， 如果人类明白是什么在太空飞船上</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the teachings of the true space technology. What we done in past two years we have walked through the alphabet of understanding the knowledge of the universe. Now we come to building:<br>这是真正的太空技术教导的开始,在过去的两年里我们所做的是带领人类理解理解宇宙的知识的字母表</p>
<p>words, letters and sentences to be able to survive in the space. You have all the tools if I would tried to teach you two years ago this you would have been lost, but now you have gathered the knowledge step by step.<br>现在我们进一步学习， 开始学会单词、字母和句子以便能够在太空中生存,你拥有所有工具 ，我两年以来教给你的知识可能会忘记， 但现在你可以把过去学到的一步一步知识收集起来</p>
<p>00:59-00:60</p>
<p>A lot of you made the whole process, nano-coating, GANS making, field making and crystal making and now you see where you sit.<br>你们中的许多人可以完成整个制作过程， 纳米涂层， 甘斯制作 ，场体制作， 水晶制作， 现在你可以看到你所到的位置</p>
<p>If you understand this, and if you start creating conditions—you see I don’t tell you anymore: ‘copper plates, zinc plates, this or that’ because now you are graduates of the University of the Keshe Foundation Knowledge Seekers – all of you<br>如果你明白这一点 ，如果你开始创造造物的条件 你看我不告诉你：“铜板、锌板 这是因为你现在已经从凯史基金会知识寻求者中毕业了 ，毕业生们–你们所有人</p>
<p>Now it is for you to bring your knowledge and collectively start working together on the internet.<br>现在是时候由你给大家分享知识并开始通过互联网一起工作</p>
<p>You have the best tools. do not dictate but try to share. Try to understand the plasma crystal technology,<br>你有最好的工具,不要用下命令的方式而是尝试用分享的方式， 尝试了解等离子体技术</p>
<p>01:00:00-01:01:00</p>
<p>What we call the field technology, can create any diamond structure .and if you create a right diamond structure of the Gans,you can create anything accross the universe .<br>我们所教的场体技术能够制造任何钻石结构 ，如果你做出了甘斯正确的钻石结构 ，你可以制造出宇宙中的任何物质</p>
<p>You need to understand the totality of the structure, many time this knowledge has been given to man but man never understood.<br>你需要理解这个结构的整体性， 许多知识已经给到人类但人们从没有理解清楚</p>
<p>The only part man ever stuck with was the knowledge of making matter alternative what we call pyramid .<br>人们卡住的知识是怎样制作替代性物质 ，我们称之为金字塔,或星体结构</p>
<p>the knowledge has been share many times ,but those who were in control of understanding never understood and those who understood to build it try to becoming the pharaohs and the other leaders.<br>相关的理论已经在教学上教过许多次， 但掌控教育的人无法理解它， 而那些可以理解并知道如何创建的人却试图成为控制者或领导者</p>
<p>01:01:00-01:02:00</p>
<p>And now at this moment the time ,A number of world leaders are in the capacity of the nation’s scientific and the development of the military have accessed to those who have taught man in the path the same. As they don’t understand, they cannot fly.<br>此时此刻， 相当数量的世界领导人在国家科技能力及军备发展仍从过去的经验中学习， 因为他们无法理解不能飞升的原因</p>
<p>Now you understand more correctively that no army and no nation will be superior to others and it is taught right across. This was done once before but somewhere along the line the greed of the man took place .<br>现在你能更加明白没有军队及国家能超越它国， 这是正确的面对话题 ，这种情况以前是存在的 ，然而被贪婪的人取代后情况发生了改变,</p>
<p>The greed of the man is very strong, but not this time. This is why we see pyramids in every corner of this planet. The knowledge was shared<br>人类的贪婪非常炽盛， 但这一次行不通了,这是为什么现在能看到这个星球上每个角落上的星体结构,知识被分享出去并创建了星体结构,</p>
<p>01:02:00-01:03:00</p>
<p>but because of lack of communication in totality it was cascaded but those who used it to rule. This time, there are no rules and the knowledge is shared correctly.<br>然而因为对整体理解沟通的缺乏， 这些知识被传授出来仍在旧有秩序中使用,这一次， 没有旧秩序， 只有正确的分享知识,</p>
<p>This is why you see pyramids across this planet. Those who understood the knowledge took it with done to used it to rule and to be better than the others.<br>这是星体结构遍布星球的原因,这些能够理解它的人创造了星体结构并通过使用它建立新的秩序 ，从而比他人更加美好平和</p>
<p>We see pyramids across this planet and now you understand how very simply (that) if you look at the pyramids, in different structures are the domes of their own spaceships.<br>我们看到星体结构遍布星球 ，通过金字塔你能明白它是多么简单， 不同的星体结构显示不同太空飞船的顶部</p>
<p>But man only made what was matter important to him and not the rest of the knowledge. Now for the first time man with the mass media we have is allowed to develop this correctly.<br>然而人类仍然只是制作对他们而言很重要的物质而并非整体知识,对人类而言这是首次通过大量的媒体允许我们以这种正确的方式发展</p>
<p>01:03:00-01:04:00</p>
<p>and Then you understand what I keep on —we are making you in totality ready to join the universal community through understanding of the technology and not by just making nano-layer or I am better because I can put some coils on top of each other.<br>然后你明白我所坚持的—我们促使你通过整体理解这项技术加入宇宙社区 而不只因为会制作纳米涂层或能把线圈叠加而自我感觉良好.</p>
<p>to be able to teach not just coatting or not just nano laying or not twisting wire or not just,adding some plasma<br>I have told you even the Christ, bless the name, or Buddha did not do .<br>因此有能力去教授对整体的理解而不只是喷涂， 纳米化， 绕线圈或增加等离子体， 我曾经跟你们说过 ，就算是耶稣或者佛陀以他们的名义也不是这样做的</p>
<p>They were guardians of the physical conduct of the man. We have thought the full knowledge with the ethos together which means that we teach not only the understanding of the physicality but the use and ethos of this use in the space.<br>他们是人类精神领域的导师,我们认为， 完整的知识包括意识层面的知识， 这意味着我们的教授除了对肉体的理解还包括在宇宙空间中意识的应用,</p>
<p>01:04:00-01:05:00</p>
<p>This is be energy, health, material and food.<br>它与能量 健康 物质及食物有关</p>
<p>K: I have taught the full spectrum of every need of the man in the language of the science with the ethos of the universe. So you understand as universal messengers we complete our work totally when the condition is ready.<br>从宇宙意识的角度 ，我已经用科学语言教授人类完整的需求频谱， 所以你可以理解宇宙信息是当条件成熟时我们以整体性完成我们的工作</p>
<p>We have not taken to make one nano-material for whatever. We start teaching you how you can use the knowledge in totality to be able to survive.<br>我们并非为任何事物制作一个纳米材料， 我们启动教学是为了你能整体理解知识以便能在太空中生存,</p>
<p>(I have taught) the basic of needs of the man in the space and the ethos to use it correctly, that we can stay alive and stay the beauty of the human race in the rest of space.<br>包括人类的基本生存需求及意识的应用， 这样能确保人类美妙的种族形式能在太空中存活下来</p>
<p>01:05:00-01:06:00</p>
<p>Every flower brings the beauty to the bouquet on the table. Even though man has done wrong, man is another flower of the creator and they brings the beauty of the talen of the creation then we joins the universal community.<br>桌上花束中的每一条花都有它的美丽,尽管人类做错了,人类仍是另一种造物之花,他们带来创造天才的美丽并带大家进入宇宙社区</p>
<p>It is for man how long that flower will last on the table according to his understanding his own strengths and his own weaknesses and not using others weaknesses but using the strengths to add to his knowledge the way we have done.<br>根据人类对自身优缺点的理解决定了人类这朵花能在桌上盛开多久,他不是利用他人的弱点而是运用自身强项去提高他的知识,是我们所一直采用的方式</p>
<p>We bring you in and we allow you a platform for you to share and proudly you shared with the other users.<br>所谓师傅领进门， 修行靠个人 ，我们带你入门， 并提供分享的平台， 因你分享的知识感到自豪</p>
<p>So now today in a very simple teaching you understand how all of you are<br>也就是说如果要成为一名太空旅行者只需用非常简单的方式教你明白你所处的阶段和位置即可</p>
<p>01:06:00-01:07:00</p>
<p>in the phase in the position to be able to become the passengers of the universe.But it is you who is choosing the level of the development according to your understanding. I have given and taught you everything.<br>然而仍取决于悟性， 即你对知识理解来决定你的发展水平 而我已倾尽所知教授</p>
<p>It is for you to start deciphering the teaching in the past 10 or 15 years. Read the books, the papers and lectures. In each lecture whick I have given across something has been released in the knowledge and it is for you to bring them totally together and start deciphering.<br>现在轮到你来对过去10-15年的知识进行解密了， 阅读书籍 ，研究论文及演讲,在我所讲过的演讲中均已释放出包含的知识.现在需要由你把这些知识整合在一起解密了</p>
<p>I just siphoned a very, very small piece for you this morning and you have seen how everything has changed in this world.<br>今天早上我只是为你解密了非常非常小的一部份， 却看到这个世界是怎样改变的</p>
<p>01:07:00-01:08:00</p>
<p>You have been in love with diamonds; now diamonds are for your use. You have been in love with energy and the fields; it is comparent how simple it is.<br>你喜欢钻石， 现在这个技术可以钻石随你所用,你喜欢能量和场体， 通过对比发现这是多么简单的技术</p>
<p>K: If you have been desiring to go into space with the spaceships, you can guarantee that survival when you are not made of aluminum (?) and titanium but evolves according to the environment it is in.<br>如果你渴望通过太空船进入太空， 确保生存的前提下你并不需要制造铝或钛但关系到进入的环境</p>
<p>Now I will not teach for hours; we teach a few minutes at a time in every teaching but then now we saw the team that they will take you years to decipher.<br>现在我不会再几个小时几个小时地教授了， 我们每次教学教授几分钟然后我们去让团队去讲说， 他们在未来的几年内将带领人类去解密技术</p>
<p>If you can decipher it correctly, those of you could have reached the maturity the understanding in totality, you should be on the verge of the creation of the first spaceships. Chinese research people are in that level.<br>如果你能正确解密， 你的团队更能达到成熟理解整体性， 那么你便能达到建造第一艘飞船的边缘,中国研究人员在这个水平</p>
<p>01:08:00-01:09:00</p>
<p>You have to understand that the Chinese government and the people within the structure of Chinese organization at the highest level I have had access to the knowledge and contact with the universal community for some time.<br>你需要明白中国政府及高层组织机构中的人在某些时候能达到我曾经到过的知识范围并能过联系上宇宙社区</p>
<p>The same has been with Russia and the United States and a number of the African nations.<br>俄罗斯,美国及一些非洲国家也可以</p>
<p>We know who and how the knowledge has been transferred but we are waiting for one responsible world leaders to commit humanity to peace, we open the rest of the doors.<br>我们知道如何转换这些知识， 但我们正等待一位有担当的世界领导者带领社区走向和平， 我们打开了剩下的门,</p>
<p>01:09:00-01:10:00</p>
<p>I think we have given a clear indication how the knowledge has to be developed and how the knowledge be expected humanity to respond to.<br>如何发展这技术以及人类如何回应这些知识， 清晰的指示已经给出</p>
<p>We start making tools of these,we start making tools which can guarantee every man can have food or what we call energy without enslaving him from his energy for you to have.<br>我们开始制作这些工具确保人类有能量食物， 而不是通过奴役他人获得食物</p>
<p>I always objected to things to be made cheap in China that the ‘best’ can have the best things but the man who makes things in China has to suffer the separation of his children<br>我常反对这样的事情， 中国制造出便宜的产品， 以让”精英”们能够享用最好的产品， 然而这些工人却必须忍受整年与他的孩子分开</p>
<p>for the year to go home for a few weeks for the rest of the people to use it. And then when they use it, they say it is ‘Chinese made’. What a disgrace to humanity.<br>只有很少的时间回家， 只是为了一些人能够使用它,然而当这些人使用这些产品， 他们却嫌弃地称之为”中国制造”,这真是人类的耻辱,</p>
<p>01:10:00-01:11:00</p>
<p>The energy of the man irrespective of his color,race and position is the same. The respect for man has to be the same.<br>不管每个人的肤色,种族和职位,人类的能量是一样的,人类所受到的尊重也是一样的</p>
<p>It is the lack of understanding of the white race in wonding himself is superior because of the last race like the last child in the house kicking to be the most important one.<br>当白人认为自己优越于其他种族时是理解缺乏， 就象一场比赛一样 ，在家里踢球最后一个孩子是最重要的一个</p>
<p>Where the man, the first child of the black race has been so humble because he knows he possesses all.<br>在那里,黑人种族的第一个孩子一直如此卑微， 因为他知道他拥有一切</p>
<p>When we stop this color division and race separation and we as one the way of Keshe Foundation is bringing all the different races together as one, then you will find it is the key to space.<br>当我们停止肤色分别种族隔离， 并作为一个整体行事时， 凯史基金会将把所有不同种族的人们整合成一个整体 ，然后你将发现通过太空的钥匙</p>
<p>01:11:00-01:12:00</p>
<p>Don’t slave man for energy,shelter or health. Then you will understand the crystal of life is the same wherever you go in space because in space you cannot be a slave by no one and nothing<br>不要通过食物， 房屋或健康奴役他人， 因为在太空中你无法不通过他人或他物成为一个奴隶 ，然后你会明白不管去往太空任何地方， 生命的晶体结构是一样的</p>
<p>because you have the knowledge you have the insight. As I have said and I written many times, we bring the knowledge of the man to the point that when we take you to the universal community,<br>因你掌握了相应知识 ，正如我重复讲和写的， 当我们带来把人们带往宇宙社区的知识</p>
<p>he does not become the slave and failure creature—he becomes equal. And this is the path of teaching. For years, I have declared.<br>他不会成为奴隶或失败的造物者—他变得平等,这是许多年来我一起坚持的方式.</p>
<p>So now it is for you to do the same on this planet that we are ready to go into space. because If you go as a divided way, you will be a slave.<br>现在轮到你用同样的方式去往太空 ，而我们都准备好了， 如果你以分裂的方式前进， 你将成为奴隶</p>
<p>01:12:00-01:13:00</p>
<p>As a full race,you have two choices: stand on this planet, do not attempt to leave and understand the consequence of what this planet is due to come to,<br>作为一个种族 你有两个选择：留在这个星球， 不要试图离开， 去理解这个星球因此存在的秩序</p>
<p>or correctively understand the past teaching for the past half hour to become one race who understands, respects each other and you got to understands one thing .<br>或者正确理解前面半小时所教授的内容， 并形成一个种族 ，互相尊重,你需要去理解一个事情</p>
<p>you have been watched all along by the outside. It’s just waiting to see when you mature. And this is the process of Keshe Foundation teaching for us to correctively mature and<br>你一直被外星力量所监视， 在等待你的成熟,</p>
<p>Understand what I have put on the table; understand how to use it and how simply you can change things because it is so simple. If you understand<br>凯史基金会一直公开教授大家以正确的方式达到成熟， 去理解如何应用它， 由此你明白因简单而可轻易地改变事物,</p>
<p>01:13:00-01:14:00</p>
<p>one fraction of what I just put on the board, you would understand it is very simple.<br>我放在船上的一部份内容， 你会明白它非常简单</p>
<p>Let’s say you understand it is you understand how to make it , turn the bucket upside down and create the fields to make the crystal for the head of the man who is so precious for him to hold,<br>这么说吧 你理解它因此你知道如何制造它， 把盒子倒转放置创造场体为喜欢钻石的人类精英们制造钻石</p>
<p>put the brain of the man and now create the crystals, the conditions of the plasmatic crystal in the brain of the man when he was damaged through a stroke. You build a cell in the confinement of <strong>_</strong>.<br>把人类意识加入进去 ，现在你可以制造了</p>
<p>You build what we said and put the man in the right position<br>生产我们所教授的并把人类放到正确的位置上</p>
<p>01:14:00-01:15:00</p>
<p>and build the GANS crystals of the structure of the heart of the child who was born with a hole in the wall of the heart. The child does not need to die.<br>生产象孩子心灵般的甘斯晶体结构 ，他们的心室天生带有洞 ，这些孩子不需要死去</p>
<p>Because now you have the knowledge and you have the understanding and you understand now how simple it has become.<br>因为现在你获得知识并理解了它 ，知道它是多么简单</p>
<p>The medical team, the doctors working in the background, this is a gift to you,<br>医疗团队的医生在后台工作 ，罗里哥医生， 这是你的礼物</p>
<p>Dr. Rodrigo.You build systems to help humanity and now you see how. It is just extending the knowledge that in your system<br>你建立医疗系统帮助人类， 现在你可以看到这个系统是如何运作的,这是医疗团队知识的扩展</p>
<p>01:15:00-01:16:00</p>
<p>You make the walls (with the coils) but understand you work with the fields and if you can make the right crystals,<br>通过线圈你制造了防护墙 ，你与场体一起工作， 如果你的方法正确你可以制作出真正的晶体</p>
<p>You stack the coils, you dictate the field of the point be the brain cell or the heart of the child.<br>那么把线圈叠加起来后可以检测到如孩子心灵般的甘斯大脑场体,</p>
<p>Field plasma technology leading to creation and conjunction with it crystal structure. Not necessity, You don’t need to see it; you don’t need to see the crystal.<br>等离子体场体技术引导钻石结构的创造与连接 ，你没有看到它的必要 ，并不需要看到钻石结构</p>
<p>because You can use the field of the balanced crystal can lead to the creation of any entity within the crystal field forces plasma or matter state.<br>因为通过利用钻石结构平衡原理在这个等离子体场体内或物质状态下可创造任何物体</p>
<p>Now you understand how simple creation is.<br>现在你明白了 ，创造是多么简单</p>
<p>01:16:00-01:17:00</p>
<p>A lot of you got lost when we showed the first coils for the Magrav system,<br>很多人搞不清方向， 当我们发布第一个能量系统蓝图时</p>
<p>if it is a right-hand turn and the left-hand turn and those who wanted to discredit your integrity and the knowledge of the Keshe Foundation ,<br>线圈的绕向是右转还是左转， 那些想要诋毁你的正直和凯史基金会的人</p>
<p>they weren’t playing with you but it gave us a chance to see our weaknesses where you are weak as in understanding how easily they are still abusing us.<br>看到这种情况， 他们不跟你玩了， 但这却给了我们一个机会看看我们的劣势在哪里 了解他们如何轻松地侮辱我们</p>
<p>look at how and what is delivered . I was talking to Sylvester last night and I explained to Sylvester very simple thing:,<br>看看他们是怎么做的，都传输了什么.我昨晚跟斯利斯物解释这个技术有多么简单</p>
<p>he said to me you know that this problem we did the catalogue wrong,we did the reactors with not fixed.<br>他对我说：“您知道这个问题 我们做错了目录， 我们做的反应堆没有固定</p>
<p>I said ,you tell anyone those who are really here to help humanity and develop the technology of commercializing for everyone can use it.<br>我说 你对任何留在这里的人说这些问题 ，这些人来帮助人类发展这项技术 ，为了让它能商业化让每一个人都能用上它</p>
<p>01:17:00-01:18:00<br>That these are the first systems, always this is the way the Italians do it not the way you do it. But at least you shown the part ; do not build on something it is wrong.<br>这是第一个系统 ，这是意大利人的方式， 而不是你的方式,但至少你可以展示一部分， 不要建立在一些错误的东西上</p>
<p>Build on what I have how can you improve it and how I can use the knowledge of the others to improve the development of technology in sharing it.<br>建立在我怎样可以发展它， 以及我怎样用他人分享出来的知识发展技术并分享出来</p>
<p>Commercialization is to share knowledge in a technical way that those who can not understand it can use it but be benefit by its beauty. We don’t take time off; you don’t take time off.<br>商业化是用共享知识的方式教授技术， 这样的方式有利于无法理解这个技术的人 ，以便他们因此受益,我们并不休息 你也不休息</p>
<p>We work irrespective of time and position. Today is a national holiday in Italy<br>我们不管时间和所处的地方一直工作,今天是意大利全国性的节日</p>
<p>01:18:00-01:19:00<br>everything is shut down ,but you see the men who want to share the knowledge are here to make sure the cameras run, to make sure the screen is there and the knowledge can be shared.<br>所有行业都休息了， 但你看到的想分享的知识的人在这里， 他们确保相机运行确保屏幕处于正常工作状态以便分享知识</p>
<p>Are we going to have 365 days of holidays in space because now that we come one nation we celebrate the Italy holiday todya,tomorrow something in Canada and the other day it will be a holiday in China?<br>我们在太空中会有365天的假期,因为我们现在是一个国家,今天我们庆祝意大利的节日 明天庆祝加拿大的节日， 有一天会庆祝中国节日</p>
<p>So life in the space is a life of celebration of holidays. We can work and celebrate every language’s holidays and best time.<br>所以生命在太空中是庆祝节日的生活， 我们可以工作并庆祝每一种语言的节日和这个最好的日子</p>
<p>We can only do that when we all have what we need and we share the knowledge and the technology together the same way.<br>当我们拥有所需要的所有东西时我们能做这些， 我们用同样的方式分享知识和技术</p>
<p>I share it freely; I wonder if you are strong enough to do the thing.<br>我自由地分享它， 我不知道你是否足够坚强去做这件事</p>
<p>01:19:00-01:20:00</p>
<p>We know governments at the highest level have access to the spaceship program which They see it but they don’t understand it. They have been on the tables of the national governments for years.<br>我们知道最高级别的政府可以访问宇宙飞船计划， 他们可以接触到这个计划但他们无法理解它,这些年来,这项技术一直放在国家政府的桌子上</p>
<p>So we invite the national governments bring what you have in the space technology which you have been given and you don’t understand<br>因此,我们邀请各国政府把你所拥有的空间技术,这是已经给到你的技术但你无法理解它</p>
<p>and we will unravel the secrets which you don’t understand. Then all of us become passengers in space.<br>我们会解开你不明白的秘密,然后我们所有人一起成为太空乘客</p>
<p>All the world leaders when they take positions, some of those who are in the strongest position as world leaders<br>世界各国领导人在担任职务时， 有些是世界上最强大国家的领导人</p>
<p>are given the secrets and to the knowledge which has been shared to them by them or by their country or nation, by the men of space.<br>得到空间技术的秘密和知识， 这些由他们或他们国家或他们国家的太空人共同分享的</p>
<p>But they never stood still to ask the question: why don’t we get all of it? because the answer is very simple: you have not committed yourselves to peace until that day<br>但他们从来没有站着问这个问题：我们为什么无法完整地拥有它？因为答案很简单：直到这一天你都没有对自己承诺致力于和平</p>
<p>01:20:00-01:21:00</p>
<p>you will be shown the cake but you cannot eat it. Now we show you how to eat the cake because we brought the tools, the plate, and the candles to celebrate.<br>我们把蛋糕展示给你， 但你不能吃它,现在我们向你展示如何吃蛋糕 ，因为我们带来了工具， 盘子和蜡烛来庆祝</p>
<p>The world does not need leaders who spread animosity, race and color separation and everything else for them to try to enforce the decisions of the others to put them in their positions.<br>世界不需要领导人散布仇恨、种族和肤色分别， 其他的一切都是为了把他们放在自己的位置让他们执行别人的决定</p>
<p>We need leaders who understand the capability of their power, the power of their decision- making to bring peace.and,We see two world leaders at this time—President Xi of China and President Putin of Russia.<br>我们需要领导人了解自身权利的能力， 他们的决策权利带来和平， 我们看到两个世界领袖能这样做—-中国的习主席和俄罗斯总统普京</p>
<p>01:21:00-01:22:00</p>
<p>In America we see nothing but hate , murder producing killing machines at the youngest infant to be the most powerful one.<br>在美国 我们只看到仇恨和谋杀,杀人机器的制造， 年轻一代是最有杀伤力的一代</p>
<p>As I said before to very high-ranking politicians: do you know why the Iranian nation is so peaceful? because we had the empires and we realized that nothing comes of it.<br>正如我对最高层领导人所说， 你知道为什么伊朗是和平的吗？因为我们有帝国， 我们意识到帝国会带来和平 ，不会发生任何事情</p>
<p>We did our conquering and king nothing out of it. But it taught us one lesson: killing does not bring advantage—it brings disadvantage because you have to pay for the souls which you have destroyed.<br>我们完成领域征服并在该领域称王,但它给我们一个教训：杀戮并没有好处带来坏处， 因为你要偿还你所毁坏的灵魂</p>
<p>so the understanding is very simple: try to use the technology in a very effective way.<br>所以理解起来很简单 ，尝度用非常有效的方式使用技术</p>
<p>01:22:00-01:23:00<br>People like Dr. Rodrigo, Benjamin, Bernie, Alexz, and the rest—Douglas in the US—are all committed to one thing<br>人们如医生里多果， 本杰明 ，伯尼， 亚力克兹和其他人 ，道格拉斯在美国 ，都致力于一件事</p>
<p>and that is to bring as much knowledge as fast as possible to humanity to change the course that man can become peacefully,so that he find peace with others.<br>就是把尽快传播更多的知识人类以便人类改变现状达成为和平,因此人类能和他人和平相处</p>
<p>So I wonder how many of you will start making crystals? If you understood,as I said ,very simply empty the bucket which,you made the GANS material in it.<br>所以我想知道你们中会有多少人开始制作水晶？如果你明白了， 正如我说的， 很简单 ，把甘斯材料放在空盒子中</p>
<p>You will find out the bucket still carries the field plasma. You were looking for the CO2 but if you look deep inside and test it, Giovanni comes me says:I am testing it ,where is the field in the bucket which is empty.<br>你会发现桶里仍然有等离子场体， 你在寻找二氧化碳 ，但如果你往深处看并测试它 ，乔凡尼跟我说：我在测试它 ，盒子是空的但有场体</p>
<p>01:23:00-01:24:00<br>I said: yes,we knew ,we know for a long time. we set it for the teaching today,So you came with the message we already said on Tuesday:<br>我说， 是的， 我们知道， 我们一直知道， 并把它放到今天的教学， 那么你知道这个周二便讲过的知识点</p>
<p>the empty bucket. Because now in your plastic bucket you have confined the fields. Throw the water away, throw the plates away.<br>空的盒子， 因为现在你的空盒子限制了场体， 把水扔了， 把盘子扔了</p>
<p>You have created the fields you will stay and then you will understand you have it now a field bucket of carbon.<br>你已经创建了用于停留的场体,然后你会明白在盒子里你有了碳的场体</p>
<p>Try to bring another bucket with copper oxide empty in it and put them together and see what you are going to get.<br>试着把氧化铜入在另外一个空盒子里 ，看看你会得到什么,</p>
<p>Now you understand the field plasma technology. Once you create it, you never lose it; you were happy to see it in the water<br>现在你明白了等离子技术,一旦你创造了它,你永远不会失去它,你很高兴看到它在水里</p>
<p>01:24:00-01:25:00</p>
<p>Now you have it in the fresh air. In what you call your containers test it, a lot of you test it.<br>现在你有新鲜的空气,在你的容器中测试它,你们中的很多人测试它</p>
<p>Put your empty container and put whatever you like in it. Test your water before and test your water with the property with the CO2 after<br>放空容器,把你喜欢的东西放进去， 对盒子中的水进行前后对比测试</p>
<p>I give you another piece information which I told you.You use the liquid plasma to create the fields that what you wanted to create.<br>我告诉你另一个信息,你使用液体等离子创造你想要的场体,,</p>
<p>01:25:00-01:26:00</p>
<p>Let’s say you have a system and you create the CO2 fields in it and try to make a pipe with just water go as from one end and it comes another<br>你用这个系统创造了二氧化碳场体 ，并用一个根管子把水从这边导向另一边</p>
<p>Here goes is fully contaminated here it comes out clean water. Field plasma technology is contained by the structure of the Nano-materials and does ever loses its strength.<br>导入污染的水导出来干净的水， 纳米材料的结构包含关等离子体场体技术， 它从来没有失去它的强度</p>
<p>Do you need to produce GANS, liquid plasma and then vapor or do you create the condition of the fields and you can contain them and do whatever you like with the fields?<br>你是否需要产生甘斯， 液态等离子体和蒸汽或你是否创建场体条件？你可以把这所有都包含了并在这个场体中做任何你喜欢的实验</p>
<p>In the space you put the field into it and the other end will concrete blocks, steel because you have predetermined the size of the crystal, the shape of the organization of the crystal<br>你把场体放在空间里， 另一端会出来一团块， 钢 ，因为你在前斯决定了晶体的大小及晶体组织的形状</p>
<p>01:26:00-01:27:00</p>
<p>and by putting the right way ,field strength the same as you did with the patches of the CO2 and the others and you created the smell and tast of the orange.<br>通过磁场强度相同的正确方式,用二氧化碳甘斯包创建了橙子的香味和味道</p>
<p>But move from plasma into the field operation and then you start understanding this is essential for you to understand this process<br>然后通过把等离子体从场体中移开,你明白这是你理解这个过程的必不可少的步骤</p>
<p>because in the universe you go through the conditions that you don’t see CO2 fields but with the environment around its, thousands and hundreds and hundreds and thousands of kilometers,<br>因为在宇宙中,你穿越整个空间时,看不到二氧化碳场体但整个环境充满着这些场体,成千上万,数百和数千公里</p>
<p>we are seeing the CO2 ,you end up in the CO2 because the fields of the universe have created it. And CO2 is the last thing you want; you don’t want to walk into a wall of crystal—<br>我们看到二氧化碳,你最终会变成二氧化碳,因为宇宙场体创造了它,二氧化碳是你最不想要的东西,你不想走进一堵水晶墙</p>
<p>01:27:00-01:28:00</p>
<p>not there. But your presence becomes it. Plasma field is the essence of creation in the universe and now we start teaching it.<br>不在那里,但你的存在变成了它,等离子场体是宇宙造物的基础,现在我们开始教授这个知识</p>
<p>Now you understand how simple it is because you have the other knowledge and we can manipulate, contain it.<br>现在你明白了它是多么简单， 因为你有其他知识， 我们可以调整这些知识并包含它</p>
<p>But as humans you needed the confirmation. I put the orange on the top and I put some fields of gasses here and I tasted the orange.<br>但作为人类,你需要确认,我把桔子放在上面,并放些气体的场体,我尝到了橙子的味道</p>
<p>Look what happened. If you emptied the water and breathed the air, you still get the orange taste and smell.<br>看看发生了什么事, 如果你把水清空并呼吸空气,你仍然可以得到橙子的味道和气味</p>
<p>Make the glass vacuum but keep the same condition in the vacuum you feel even smelling and eating in the orange because man is so physical he always needs something to do<br>让玻璃真空,但在真空中保持相同条件,你甚至能闻到橙子的气味和味道,因为人的身体如此物质化,他总需要做些事情</p>
<p>01:28:00-01:29:00</p>
<p>You done nothing different.Those of you who understood but got lost in the process—see what you have done.<br>你所做的没有什么不同,那些理解了这些知识但在操作过程中不明白的人,看看自己曾经所做过的</p>
<p>You created the fields with the protein around the box that brought you the smell of the orange. here ,you looked for gases and you have everything to collect it.<br>你用盒子周围的蛋白质创造了这个场体,给你带来了橙子的味道,在这里,你寻找气体,你用一切收集它</p>
<p>Empty the water. Taste the air; you still get a full orange. Taste energy in everything. But you had to have liquid to confirm you had something. So you have already been in the plasma field technology.<br>清空水,呼吸空气,你仍然得到一个完整的橙子， 通过这些味道去感受能量,但你需液体以确认这里面有东西,所以你通过这个过程使用了等离子磁场技术</p>
<p>01:29:00-01:30:00</p>
<p>This is important because for our medical people if you understand it.<br>如果你明白了这点,这对医疗医药行业的人来讲非常重要</p>
<p>Do we need to give children anything for immunizations other than we putting them through a field which embeds the information in their body that measles and the rest cannot develop?<br>除了把孩子放到场体中把信息嵌入进身体以免疫麻疹及其它疾病以外， 我们还需要对孩子们做什么免疫措施吗</p>
<p>And then we find it. And all these pharmaceutical companies are putting mercury in the vaccines to make the children retarded.<br>然后我们找到它,发现所有这些制药公司都把汞加入疫苗， 使儿童智力发育迟缓</p>
<p>This is very simple. Now we don’t teach anything, but understanding the technical aspects of what you have learned for the past two years. Teaching is easy now because you have seen it and done it.<br>这很简单,现在我们不教任何东西,但去理解过去两年你所学到的技术内容,教学是很容易的,因为你已经看到它并做了实验</p>
<p>01:30:00-01:31:00<br>It is now something new opens,now you opens a new door to look at the whole structure. I said when one of you comes to a point, I will teach the rest.<br>现在是时候开启新的一善门来看看整个结构,我说过当你们中的一个人说到一个点的时候 我会教其他的内容</p>
<p>When somebody comes doing things that understanding now I give the guidance to be able to finish it.<br>当你们中的人能够理解它并做实验我会提供指导以让大家能完成它</p>
<p>Do we need liquid plasma for the systems which is getting developed in Philippines?<br>菲律宾研发的系统需要液态等离子体吗？</p>
<p>You know exactly what I am talking about, those who are working on the research on that side.<br>你很清楚我正在说什么 ，这些正致力于研究的人明白我说的情况</p>
<p>Do we need to carry the energy as a fuel or can we carry the energy through understanding of it as fields?<br>我们是否需要携带能量作为燃料 ，或者我们是不是需要通过携带能量来理解场体?</p>
<p>01:31:00-01:32:00<br>And When it comes to the engine, it releases the energy and it satisfies the man need that something moves. but very interesting in the coming time, when they fills the pistons will go up and down and there is no fuel at all in it.<br>当它涉及到引擎 ，它释放能量 ，并满足了人们移动东西的需要,但非常有趣的是， 在未来的时间 ，当他们填补活塞上下运动时并没有发现燃料在里面</p>
<p>But it still converts the energy of space of the universe in a mechanical rotation that can carry the man.<br>但它仍然将宇宙空间的能量转换成可以携带人类的机械旋转</p>
<p>This is what our friends in the research center in the Philippines have been doing and they could not understand it. Maybe now it enlightens you exactly what is going on.<br>这是我们菲律宾研究中心朋友一直在做的,但他们无法理解它,或许现在它给你们提供了些灵感</p>
<p>and If you understand the power of the plasma to become equal to the matter state of the cylinders, you will find out your car will run without the fuel.<br>如果你明白等离子的力量, 等同于物质状态的气缸,你会发现你的车不用燃料就可以运行</p>
<p>My deepest consideration to the oil-producing nations. We have just written off the whole oil industry.<br>我对石油生产国最关注,我们刚刚注销了整个石油工业</p>
<p>01:32:00-01:33:00</p>
<p>As I said, the teaching will coming very fast and those who understandwill develop very quickly.<br>就像我说的， 教学速度及那些理解了原理的知识寻求着的发展会很快</p>
<p>Our Chinese team headed by Professor Zhu, you are developing mass production GANS systems for oasis (?).<br>我们中国团队由朱教授领导， 朱教授是不是正在为绿洲系统发展量产甘斯？</p>
<p>For the Chinese team working with the scientific section, this is for you to understand. In the mass production of the GANS you are doing try to create homogenous<br>中国团队正与科学界一起合作,这是让你明白,甘斯的量产是正在尝试生产均匀的单体甘斯?</p>
<p>and try then to use the field of the GANS to create the condition of the structure of the crystal in it.<br>并尝试利用甘斯场体去创造晶体结构环境,</p>
<p>You have to learn how to convert the energy using the position of the GANS to interact the crystal condition of the energy.<br>你必须学会利用甘斯定位去转换能量,即晶体如何在能量条件下相互作用</p>
<p>01:33:00-01:34:00</p>
<p>Your space people in the Chinese space agency understand exactly what I am talking about. You use one to contain the other. We use the matter to create GANS nano-material and contain them;<br>中国航天航空局的人完全明白我在说什么,一个包含另一个,我们使用的物质创造甘斯纳米材料及物质中包含它们</p>
<p>Now you use the condition of the GANS to contain the plasma and then contain the fields because it is the only way you can contain field plasma–not by matter,<br>现在你用甘斯环境包含等离子体然后包含场体,因为这是唯一一个可以包含等离子场体的方式—不是通过物质</p>
<p>But by application of the fields which come from the liquid plasma which themselves are controlled by the nano and the matter state.<br>而是通过场体应用,这些来自液态等离子体,这些液体等离子体由纳米和物质状态所控制</p>
<p>01:34:00-01:35:00</p>
<p>So if you understood this, it should be very easy for you to use your matter to create the crystals of the matter.<br>所以你理解这一点 ，对你来讲应该很容易,用物质创造物质的晶体<br>you want the crystal copper to be a diamond .The color of the green which you are used the CO2, now you can do that.<br>你想把铜晶体变成一颗钻石,你常生产出绿色的二氧化碳甘斯,现在你可以生产出钻石,</p>
<p>The knowledge you have to understand is easy but it is for you to extend the knowledge. Is Benjamin online? Rick.<br>你需要理解的知识非常简单,现在是时候让你来扩展知识了,瑞克,本杰明在线吗？</p>
<p>Benjamin (B): I am here.<br>B：我在这里,</p>
<p>K:Good Morning Benjamin.<br>K:早上好 本杰明,</p>
<p>B:Good Morning Sir.How are you ?<br>B:早上好 先生 你好吗？</p>
<p>K: that’s guy , Are ready to share us with the understanding of the holding of the plasma within the matter?<br>K:是那家伙， 准备好与我们分享对物质中等离子体的理解了吗？</p>
<p>01:35:00-01:36:00</p>
<p>B: yes I am ready to share with you. Daniel is around here.He really want to go away ,but I told you ask me to start right away<br>B:是的 我准备好与你分享了,丹尼尔在这儿,他准备走,但我说你会让我马上开始</p>
<p>K: Please share the knowledge you are achieving beautiful dimensions in the plasma technology. Let us understand.<br>K:你做成了等离子体技术的美丽尺寸， 请分享给我们让大家学习一下</p>
<p>B: ok,Today what we are going to share with you is a soap that we made. Daniel was able to do the microbiology analysis in this lab and then the results were amazing. The estimated bacteria killing time was within the 50 minutes range.<br>B：好的,今天要分享我们制作的肥皂,丹尼尔在这个实验室里做了微生物分析,结果是惊人的,估计细菌杀灭时间在50分钟内</p>
<p>01:36:00-01:37:00</p>
<p>So after 50 minutes, when you opened the cordral containers all the bacteria was gone.so he was really amazed and he told us that this is good product ,<br>50分钟后,当你打开容器后发现所有的细菌都消失了,丹尼尔感到非常惊讶,然后他告诉我们这个产品质量很好</p>
<p>he will sell on the market and he wanted us to do a further work on it. for now We are going to share with you the hard one, we also have a liquid one which is sitting on the table currently.<br>他将拿到市场上去卖,他希望我们在这上面深入研究下去,现在,我们准备给大家看固体肥皂,我们同样有液体肥皂,现在放在桌上</p>
<p>K:Can you share the screen with us ,we don’t see the share<br>K：你可以共享屏幕吗,我们看不到共享</p>
<p>B: ok I am going to share my screen with you .is it ok ?<br>B:好的 我现在共享屏幕出来,现在好了吗</p>
<p>K: Yes, we see the bottoms<br>K：是的， 我们看到了底部</p>
<p>01:37:00-01:38:00</p>
<p>B:Screen,ok ,so that is what we are going to share today .<br>B:屏幕,好的,这是我们今天要讲的内容</p>
<p>That is Keshe Foundation Ghana Nano Soap Microbiology Report we are currently at the Ghana Space science center ,I am here with Danial Microbiology<br>这是凯史基金会加纳纳米肥皂微生物学报告,我们目前在加纳空间科学中心,微生物学家丹尼尔和我在一起</p>
<p>B: He has been done a lot of analysis with us. So I want to go to straight into the power point that we have.<br>B:丹尼尔和我们一起做了很多分析,那么我想直接讲解PPT的内容,</p>
<p>Everyone who is watching and listening to us properly in his life time have used the soap before. Basically a soap is a substance used together with water for washing and cleaning.<br>正在收看和收听我们教学的每一位在生活中都用过肥皂,基本上肥皂是生活必须品,和水一起用来洗涤清洁</p>
<p>It is made up from two compounds normally natural oils so animal fats with sodium hydroxide or another strong alkali, the fat some people call it tallow normally after doing this composition<br>它是由两种材料合成通常是天然油脂如动物脂肪与氢氧化钠或其他强碱混合而成,脂肪也有人叫它牛油,通常把它们混合后</p>
<p>01:38:00-01:39:00<br>They add the fume and color to it and then they are chief of the soap. Do you know that soap have been used for human for at least for the last 6000 years in one form or the others it is something we can’t live without .<br>添加香料和颜色制成肥皂的主料,我们知道人类使用肥皂的历史超过6000年,以不同的形式存在我们的生活中,成为必不可少的日用品</p>
<p>and the first soap was made by Babylonians .Historical references points to that fact that, soap making were used in the textile industry and it is still used in the textile<br>第一个肥皂是由巴比伦制造的,历史文献指出,事实上,肥皂主要用在纺织行业,到现在它仍然被用在纺织行业</p>
<p>and we used it to wash and our soap then can wash our clothes and then we used it for medicine .<br>我们用它来做清洁， 洗衣服， 同样它也可以作药被应用</p>
<p>Over here in Ghana they are so look up medicine which is so prevail , they put it small in the water and put it in the stream and people and animal so that they can wash in textile .that is something that I know for sure that people doing here .,<br>在加纳他们药品需求盛行,他们把它放在水里或小溪中,人们和动物可以在里面清洗</p>
<p>01:39:00-01:40:00<br>But how safe like our sister have been doing is I believing that medicinally powerful .this are the historical fact about soap .<br>但它是安全的就像我们姐妹所做的那样我认为作为药品的效果很强大,关于肥皂的历史事实</p>
<p>it was the Asia Europeans who’s start to use it .and France in fence in Marseilles they have a lot of factories which spread finally to Italy and then the British also seeing the booming this business jump on the treading ,<br>是亚欧人开始使用它,在法国的马赛有很多工厂,后来传播到意大利,英国看到这块生意蓬勃发展也做起了生意</p>
<p>In Britain the first soap factory was situated in Bristol in 12th Century. Another factory was established in Cheapside in London around the 13th century.<br>英国的第一个肥皂厂建于十二世纪， 坐落在布里斯托尔,另一个厂成立于第十三世纪 位于伦敦的齐普赛街</p>
<p>And because they get a lot of money from that because everyone was easy make so they thought it could ??? taxing for government, During the era of Napoleonic wars,<br>因为制造工艺简单,人们从肥皂产业中赚了很多钱,政府认为应该对此收税,在拿破仑统治时期</p>
<p>01:40:00-01:41:00<br>Government tax inspectors went to home people are doing in it Italy so they will ever to get into home and then see spans ??? not be able to produce this product in the night .so that was what is the historical fact for soap<br>政府税务稽查人员去查意大利人在家里生产,他们隔一段时间去查看,这样他们晚上不能生产这个产品,那么这是肥皂的历史事实</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the modern facts what our trade are so busy .<br>现在我们看下肥皂的现代史， 肥皂生意非常繁忙.</p>
<p>It is estimate about 10 billion pounds per year also so is used over world and U. S uses about one third of it .<br>每年全世界贸易额是100亿磅,美国占了三分之一</p>
<p>Per capita consumption in US is 25 lbs; the Netherlands 24 lbs; UK 20 lbs; Japan 7 lbs; Brazil 6.8 lbs; the uses are classified: world average to laundry U.S use by 85% for laundry and<br>美国人均消费量为25磅,荷兰24磅,英国20磅,日本7磅,巴西6.8磅,用途分类：世界平均洗衣： 美国85%用于洗衣服</p>
<p>01:41:00-01:42:00</p>
<p>3% for toilet and so on .and this is the source from the soap magazine that I got it for<br>3%用于洁厕及其他,这是从肥皂杂志而来的数据</p>
<p>B: In doing this I formed a team, some of them are on the way coming, I start lab by myself, and Nash and serval people I love .<br>为了做这些我组成了一个团队,他们中的一些人正在来的路上,我和纳什及其他几个人组建实验室</p>
<p>and this are from the chemistry lab so we decide to do this together. So that’s the team as you see .<br>并开始一起做实验,这是我们的团队</p>
<p>and this are the ingredients we used : sodium hydroxide; soda ash; coconut oil; palm kernel oil; glycerin; shea butter; cocoa butter; fragrance; nano-material; water .<br>这是肥皂的成份：氢氧化钠；纯碱；椰子油；棕榈油；甘油；乳木果油；可可脂；香味；纳米材料；水</p>
<p>So this are the stone that we use .Then I will go into details why I even chose these materials to use in the making of the soap in the first place because it have a lot of medicinal benefits.<br>那么这是我们用的底料,我会详细介绍为什么我选择这些材料来制作肥皂,它有很多药物好处,</p>
<p>01:42:00-01:43:00</p>
<p>So first of all to get further I want you to understand the skin of man is the largest organ of the human body. It is easy to be poisoned to the ??? of the skin easily<br>皮肤是人体最大的器官,皮肤很容易吸收外面的东西中毒</p>
<p>because that is why when you get into a mono-carbon because it can seep into your blood fast and then you will be to lose your life (carbon monoxide poisoning).<br>当你接触单元子碳时它能快速进入你的血液中,导致性命丢失 (一氧化碳有毒)</p>
<p>So the skin does not only protect the internal organs and systems of man, it also gives visible and emotional feedback<br>皮肤不仅保护人体内部器官及系统,也提供可见的情感反馈</p>
<p>so when you have rushes in some part of body is telling you is exactly like a instrumentation panel of a car .when they rush m you know you car empty so you have to fill it,<br>如果身体一部分出问题通过冲刷进行清洗,完全像车辆仪表板,当清洗身体时你的车清空了</p>
<p>01:43:00-01:44:00<br>The same thing apply in the body, when you it gives visible signs of what is happening inside. Those who have been doing the GANS we have learned that putting a cutten clearer or paper layer or cotton layer,<br>同样的东西适用于身体,身体会呈现体内改变的情况,我们从那些制作甘斯的人那里学习制作甘斯 里面放一层纸或棉纱纸</p>
<p>you are able to mimic this layers of the skin—epidermis, dermis, and hypodermic, three layer of the skin.So in somebody have been If you understand this,<br>这可以模仿皮肤的表皮,真皮,和皮下,三层皮肤,所以如果你了解这个结构</p>
<p>you can easily look at this structure and went back or restore the health to the body.<br>这个结构易于理解,它返回到身体层面或恢复身体健康</p>
<p> Because it is physically or painting base on the plasma principle or gravitational and magnetic field ,the whole body of man .<br> 因为它是物质层面的 ，或者基于人体整体结构中的磁引力场或等离子体场进行描绘的</p>
<p>01:44:00-01:45:00</p>
<p>As you see the hair follicles, if a bit of water sits on the body it will seep into the blood stream easily, because there was ? have created by nature for mimic.<br>当你看到毛囊,如果有一点水在身体上,它会很容易地渗透到血液中,因为人体结构？模大自然创造</p>
<p>When you liquid seep into blood stream quickly .So Bathing even with good water so rich adds to your total well-being so that was skin of man for you<br>液体容易快速渗入血液中,所以高能量的水洗澡将很好的增加你的幸福感,通过你的皮肤传输能量</p>
<p>So I like said before we chose the materials for this production very carefully because we believe that coconut oil has many fatty<br>所以我以前喜欢说,我们非常小心的选择生产材料因为我们相信椰子油有很多有益的脂肪</p>
<p>Because looking at the coconut is a plasma the way the water is inside the coconut the whole structure..<br>椰子是等离子体,椰子中的水具有大自然的所有结构?</p>
<p>01:45:00-01:46:00</p>
<p>It is like the nature of the air is .So Coconut Oil consists of health fats called medium-chain fatty acids (M.C.F.A) and these unique fats include Capryllic Acid, Lauric acid and Capric acid<br>椰子油像空气的特性,由健康脂肪称之为中链脂肪酸（m.c.f.a）组成,这些独特的脂肪包括辛酸、月桂酸和癸酸</p>
<p>Let me show you ,give you a ? evident media-chain fat .for example ,you take the ?? oil and the you put it on fire and then you put the coconut oil and then you put it on another fire .<br>让我告诉你一个证据,显示媒介脂肪链,例如,你把?油放在火上烧,然后把椰子油放在另一个火上烧</p>
<p>And set the fire at the same time ,you see the coconut oil you know burn faster than the ? oil. It is easier for the body to digest energy .The body is able to consumed coconut oil, it is not readily stored as fat.<br> 在同一时间,可以看到椰子油的燃烧速度比？油快,身体更容易消化椰子油的能量,不易储存为脂肪</p>
<p>01:46:00-01:47:00</p>
<p>Coconut oil has antimicrobial and anti-fungal properties. Because of these properties, the cell is able to use it and release energy quickly.<br>椰子油具有抗菌和抗真菌的特性,因此,细胞能很快吸收它,并释放能量</p>
<p>So coconut oil is easily processed by the liver, Because when it’s fatty and can’t make it is difficult for the liver to process .It is end of accolated all kinds of field in the liver .It create a lot of fat .<br>肝脏容易吸收椰子油,它的脂肪不会使肝脏消化困难, 它能转换在肝脏的各种场休?,并创造大量脂肪</p>
<p>It is one body but that what’s all the time .So it make with food all the time .So coconut oil is best for your body .<br>它一直是一个整体,持续为人类制造食物,所以椰子油最适合人类身体,</p>
<p>Like I have learned if you want to put water in your car if you can consume the water yourself .Then you can also give it to the car but water is not good for you to consume but when you also put it in the car it was damage<br>就像我所发现的,如果你想给你的车加水,你可以消耗自己的水,然后你也可以给它加外面的水,但这对车来讲不好消化会对车造成损害</p>
<p>01:47:00-01:48:00<br>The same thing applies if you can apply it in your body and it can feed your body well then when you enter thing in mouth your body can process well .<br>同样的如果你把它应用在身体上,食用它,它可以给你的身体提供很好的能量</p>
<p>So the second ingredient we use also was coco butter .Coco butter oil also has Anti-Aging properties that means the living we are currently working on release what we are doing now.<br>另外可可黄油的油也具有抗老化性能,意味着释放我们目前生活的压力</p>
<p>We are working on eczema also with the Gans so that you can use it to treat as man skin disease. Cocoa Butter helps improve the quality of hair it is good also in maintaining skin health<br>我们正用甘斯对治湿疹问题,这样你可以用它来治疗皮肤病,可可脂有助于提高头发质量,也可很好地保持皮肤健康</p>
<p>Cocoa butter can be used to reduce inflammation. It has high quantity of antioxidant so it is able to fight off free radicals<br>可可脂可用来减少炎症,它具有很高的抗氧化能力,所以它能够对抗自由基</p>
<p>01:48:00-01:49:00<br>Coco butter also has high fatty acids, because this high fatty acids, it is able to enter into the skin ,if it is infuse with medicine ,you know ,it can heal the body<br>可可黄油也有很高的脂肪酸,这种高脂肪酸,可以进入皮肤,如果与药物混合作药用,可以治愈身体</p>
<p>The next one is ,this one is planting here in African in the tropical zoon and this is Palm tree and other palm tree we get the palm kernel oil .<br>下一个植物种植在热带的非洲,是棕榈树和棕榈仁油</p>
<p>And if you were watch this you know you are following what happen during the Katrina .It is one of the trees that was able to slam the sun..<br>在卡特丽娜飓风期间,如果你了解当时的情况就知道,它是其中一种能够抵御风暴的树</p>
<p>Most of the trees fell and were hit by the hurricane. But the palm tree stood .over year nothing from the palm tree is thrown away;<br>大部分被飓风袭击的树都倒下了,但棕榈树一直站着,数年来没有一棵棕榈树被毁坏</p>
<p>01:49:00-01:50:00<br>Everything is useful right from the roots to the fruit. Nothing is ….for me, we use the oil, we use the whole thing for food, we use it for fuel and so many things.<br>一切都是有用的,从根到果实,没有什么是无用的,对我来说,我们用它作食用油,食物,燃料和许多其它用途</p>
<p>We also have seen that it is a little bit with zero cholesterol that it is good for people with Alzheimer’s, people with disease like who want to reduce their cholesterol.<br>我们也看到它的零胆固醇特性,它对阿尔茨海默氏症很有效果,患者可以用它降低胆固醇</p>
<p>In that line we can also deal with diabetes in this??. it is not that we antioxidants it is also concentrate the fat which in vitamin K and zero transfer .It does not store the fat ,it doesn’t keep it ,it release energy<br>同样我们也可以它来处理糖尿病？,这并不是我们说的抗氧化剂,而是维生素K集中在脂肪且脂肪零转移,它不储存脂肪不保存脂肪但释放能量</p>
<p>01:50:00-01:51:00</p>
<p>and it contains a lot of vitamin A .and it has a along with a long shelf life. And then it is filled with other nutrients .It can improve your hair growth and it provides also soft for your skin nature .<br>而且它含大量维生素A 且生命期长,饱含其它营养元素,可促进头发生长,保持肌肤柔软自然</p>
<p>This are in ？ or It is part of the passel of the palm kernel .So we start with the step making process, and that is step one, As you see Nash with us<br>这是? 是棕榈仁的一部份,我们从这里开始制作过程的第一步,纳什现在与我们一起</p>
<p>Nash is diabetic the caustic for us to dissolve in water .That is some of the ingredient that we use the caustic ,so we have this ? that by him and you can see the ash water over the them .<br>在用它来处理糖尿病,把烧碱溶于水中,这是一些需要用到的成分,纳什正在进行这些步骤?,你可以看到上面的灰水</p>
<p>01:51:00-01:52:00</p>
<p>That is what it has we bought, a little bit of the caustic in the cup so that he can mix it and then after went the step two:<br>我们买了一点烧碱放在杯子并混合它们,然后来到第二步</p>
<p>Measure all the oil and then having melt and then we pour that into a mixing bowl as you can see and then Add the soda ash slowly and stir;<br>测量所有油,然后让他们融化,之后把它倒入一个搅拌碗,你可以看到这里,然后加入苏打粉慢慢搅拌,</p>
<p>K:Benjamin,Go back to steps and next flames the last two steps again please .Go back to flame after the cocoa nut at the palm .Yes,explain this step by step<br>K:本杰明,请回到最后两张页面,椰子油之后的页面 是的,请逐步解释它<br>,<br>B:Ok,so cocoa nut oil has anti-aging properties that was when we put it or leave it in your face beginning to have lines in from of your face .<br>B: 好的,所以可可坚果油具抗老化性能,当我们把它应用于脸部时,它开始从你的脸部线条起作用</p>
<p>01:52:00-01:53:00</p>
<p> So as I show in the picture .<br>正如我演示的图片</p>
<p>?: The internet disso see ?<br>网络好象看不到了</p>
<p>B:can you see ?<br>B：请问您可以看到吗？</p>
<p>K:Yes we can see you<br>K：是的 可以看到</p>
<p>B:ok,so as I said when somebody feel start “folding” we can use the coconut oil and like I show in the picture in the picture of the skin.<br>B：好的,就像我说的,当人们感觉脸部开始起皱纹-“折叠”时,我们可以使用椰子油,像图片演示的皮肤</p>
<p>The cocoa nut oil ,the cocoa butter because of this qualities ,it can penetrate into the fore skin and the skin and then enter into the damaged areas<br>因为可可坚果油这种品质,它可渗透前皮肤和底层皮肤,然后进入皮肤受损区域</p>
<p>you know increase that we call it the overall the health of the skin. So it can also add to the good quality .<br>你知道它增强了皮肤的弹性,我们称之为皮肤的整体健康,因此它对你的头皮能起到很好的激活效果</p>
<p>01:53:00-01:54:00<br>On your what we call it the skin of your head or the scalp of your head so when you ? in cocoa water .I recently had a lot of students from different countries of Africa; they are university student ,<br>实验室最近来了很多来自非洲不同国家的大学生</p>
<p>most of them went and show them the property of the cocoa butter ,most of them bought huge quantities from ?me to take home they are look whatever they are coming from .So that is another quality .<br>我们向他们中的大多数人展示了可可脂特性,很多人买了大量可可脂带回家,不管他们从哪个国家来,这是另一个优点</p>
<p>Because one of the guy from Rwanda told me it is very expensive in Rwanda to get the cocoa butter .But It is so cheap here to get, He bought a lot of them and then carried them at home .<br>一位来自卢旺达的家伙告诉我,在卢旺达可可脂非常昂贵,这里却很便宜,他买了很多,然后带回家里</p>
<p>So it is good for maintain skin well. Cocoa butter can be used to reduce the inflammation ,that means in somebody have ?,and you mix it with the light soap ,<br>它能保持皮肤年轻,也可用来减少炎症,这意味可以？,把它与少量肥皂混合在一起</p>
<p>01:54:00-01:55:00</p>
<p>you can also reduce inflammation of the skin .Antioxidant :Cocoa butter is high in antioxidants which help fight off free radicals .So free radicals in the bloods<br>可以它减少皮肤炎症,抗氧化,可可脂是抗氧化剂以帮助抵抗血液中的自由基</p>
<p>You can use it to cook as well .Use this to cook you will also end of fighting this free radicals in your body.Cocoa butter has also fatty acids that means have this M.C.F.E the media-chain fatty acid ok .<br>你也可以用它来做食物,用这个结束与体内自由基的抗争,可可脂脂肪酸意味着它具有良好的脂肪酸媒介链</p>
<p>and it can penetrate into the layer of the skin very well and then help you the skin .Mr Keshe .do I need to explain this again .?<br>它可以很好地渗透进皮肤,然后帮助保持你的皮肤年轻,凯史先生,我需要再解释一下吗？</p>
<p>K :no no ,go back ,go down ,just explain what your next step to make the soap .<br>K:不,不,不用,回到前面,只需要解释下一步怎样制作肥皂就可以</p>
<p>B:Ok,so making the soap were simple ,as you see in the picture ,that is Nash measuring the caustic .<br>B: 好的,制作肥皂是非常简单的,正如你看到的图片,纳什正在称量烧碱</p>
<p>01:55:00-01:56:00,<br>B:And dissolving it in the ? flat as you see of it .And them after this we measured all the oils and them have them melted and then we poured it into a mixing bowls<br>并把它融解在?油中,然后我们测试所有的油和并融化它们,然后倒入搅拌碗</p>
<p>as you can see it here and then add it the Naoh that we stir and continue stir until a thick mixture .It is mixture is and then we add Gans .<br>你可以看这里,加入氢氧化钠后搅拌,继续搅拌直到得到厚厚的混合物,然后添加甘斯</p>
<p>After this we then continue stirring we add the Gans and stir it until it was evenly mixed in the thick mixture .<br>之后我们再继续搅拌加入甘斯后搅拌,直到混合均匀得到厚厚的混合物</p>
<p>K:What kind of Gans did you add<br>K:你加了什么甘斯进去</p>
<p>01:56:00-01:57:00</p>
<p>B:So as you can see we have CO2,CH3,Copper oxide ,we do a lot of configuration that I will show it in next slip<br>B：所以你可以看到我们有CO2、CH3、氧化铜 我们做了很多的配置 我将在下个页面展示出来</p>
<p>so this part is palm kernel oil the one with red fruit And then the white oil over here is coconut oil.as you can see look at the picture see at the left add the plastic containers<br>这部分是棕榈仁油,是红色果实,那么白色的是椰子油,从图片可以看到左边甘斯的塑料容器</p>
<p>you have copper oxide Gans and then we have Co2 plus Ch3 and then we had controls and then control all soap .This is just a little bit what we have because we did different configurations<br>这是氧化铜甘斯,我们把二氧化碳甘斯和铁甘斯混合,然后控制配置,这是是其中一部份不同的配置,还有许多其它不同的配置没有在这上面</p>
<p>01:57:00-01:58:00</p>
<p>Because what you are looking ? which I will explain in ? .<br>因为你在看什么？我要解释一下吗？</p>
<p>We have copper oxide plus Co2 and then we have different configuration Ch3 and Copper oxide ,Ch3 and Co2 mix together and them someone they are separate containers .<br>我们用氧化铜甘斯加二氧化碳甘斯,然后我们有不同配置,氢甘斯和氧化铜甘斯,氢甘斯和二氧化碳甘斯混合在一起 他们有他们独立的容器</p>
<p>So If you have understood the plasma the ? This plasma if you? the physically you see that the Co2 controls the blood system all the motions<br>那么如果你明白了等离子的话？如果你的血浆？在你发现二氧化碳甘斯控制血液系统的运动</p>
<p>and CH3 controls the neuro system that is energy flow and the copper oxide controls the lymph system which has to do with your physical well-being, or your physical or your physicality structure.<br>氢甘斯对应神经系统控制能量流和氧化铜控制淋巴系统与身体健康或肉体结构有关</p>
<p>01:58:00-01:59:00<br>So if somebody I have seen always when somebody have big pain like people somebody have a pain on their hand a swell and sour on their hand and you apply the GANS normally they are in pain immediately<br>所以,如果有人手部痛苦,肿胀和酸痛,你把甘斯涂在上面,他们通常感到痛,</p>
<p>but afterwards when you apply in the 3 layers, these people suddenly go to sleep quickly and immediately. If Nash was around he would confirm that.<br>但当涂了三次后,患者入睡变得非常快,如果纳什在他身边,他可以证实这一点</p>
<p>When he had burns on his hands, the doctors healing him go and come tomorrow and I said why don’t you let me try this on your skin ,and he allow me to heal him ,the following day that ? come to he said Benjamin even if I sleep,<br>当他手上烧伤的时候,医生跟他说,明天来,我说,你为什么不让我尝试甘斯治疗你的皮肤,他让我用在烧伤处,第二天？,他说,本杰明即使我睡觉</p>
<p>01:59:00-01:60:00</p>
<p>Even it is one around, it is good, I feel so good about sleep and about one week the whole thing was gone and fire burn which normally leave a scar you know left ?,a scar on the skin .<br>即使只是涂在周围,效果也很好， 我感觉睡眠很好,大约一个星期,整个烧伤都消失了,火灾烧伤,通常会在皮肤上留下疤痕</p>
<p>If you will I want to show it to you like we can see there is no show you the aera the skin was burn ,there is no scar leave of the skin. The skin looked beautiful.<br>如果你愿意我们可以展示给你看显示没有留下烧伤的疤痕的皮肤,皮肤看起来很美</p>
<p>So that is the representation ,so we are looking for energy for where we wonder to deal if we are looking for something that will help improve your emotions make you happy<br>这是我们的展示,所以我们正在寻找能用甘斯应用于改善情绪增加情绪平和的配置</p>
<p>that we add we use the CO2 and CH3 GANS. When we are dealing with pain we mix the copper oxide and CO2 GANS<br>我们增加了所用到的二氧化碳甘斯和氢甘斯,当我们处理疼痛时用混合氧化铜和二氧化碳甘斯</p>
<p>02:00:00-02:01:00</p>
<p>And then when water to increase the field of the emotions also we use the Ch3 you know Gans .Because when we are talking about Ch3,<br>然后用氢甘斯增强情感场体,因为当我们谈论氢甘斯时,</p>
<p>you are taking a field application which possible with the Ch3 Gans, So that is the various Nano Gans composition.<br>是用氢甘斯的场体应用,这是各式各样纳米甘斯的组合</p>
<p>So after this you can see that this we left the soap,I like the soap to cure,.When it is me like curing is we allow the Soap to sit so that the water use in preparing the soap a vapor.<br>在此之后你可以看到 ，我们静置肥皂,我喜欢用肥皂治疗,当我用肥皂治疗时使其融于水中制备肥皂水蒸气</p>
<p>Because you use water distill water in dissolving the sodium have ? So curing in simply we allow the soap is cured for four to six weeks. During this time the water used in the recipe evaporates.<br>因为你把钠溶化进蒸馏水中,以此进行简单的治疗,我们允许通过四至六周时间用肥皂治疗,在这个时间里,食谱中所用的水蒸发了 ？</p>
<p>02:01-02:02</p>
<p>The advantage here is the cured soap has a firmer texture and lasts for longer in the shower.So as you can see here ,this one has Co2 Gans control ,we select this one so we can show it to you .<br>优点是固体香皂有坚实质地可在淋浴时间持续使用,所以你可以在这里看到,这其中用二氧化碳甘斯进行控制,我们选择其中一个展示给你</p>
<p>The cocoa nut oil is still has the liquid texture after even the week of sitting .But this the five one the one which we appear because it have Gans in it .<br>可可坚果油有液体质地甚至立起一周后仍未倒,但这五个中我们都加了甘斯在里面,</p>
<p>this is the palm kernel oil .They almost look the same but when you feel it you can see the difference or so .The one with the cooper oxide is also harder .So that is what you can see one the PPT .<br>这是棕榈仁油,它们看起来几乎是一样的,当你去感觉它们时可以看到区别,有氧化铜更硬些,所以,这是我们PPT所展示的内容</p>
<p>02:02-02:03</p>
<p>B: After the six weeks’ time we decided to package the soap and handed it to the microbiology lab for analysis. So we have a lot of Ziploc bags and labelling them with varies code which are reviewing it to Daniel now .<br>六周后,我们决定将肥皂包装并交给微生物实验室进行分析,所以我们有很多保鲜袋,把他们贴上不同标签并由丹尼尔检查</p>
<p>Because you didn’t know what was it inside. We wanted him to do a blind study so that he doesn’t influence with the results in a way. So we label it, what you see here is HS :HS means hard soap ,<br>因为你不知道里面是什么,我们希望他做盲测试,使他不影响的测试结果,所以我们贴上标签,你在这里看到的是：HS 代表硬肥皂</p>
<p>and then L is lab so HSL is Hardsoap Lab .That is hard soap that was made in the lab ,as you can see their also some bottles and we will show next time how the bottles are looking. They are collapsing on themselves<br>L是实验室 HSL是硬肥皂实验室,指实验室出品的硬肥皂,你可以看到有一些瓶子,我们将在下次展示瓶子,硬肥皂会自己崩溃了</p>
<p>02:03-02:04</p>
<p>Because the energy released by the Gans is so mind that it was socking everything,you can see the bottles you know he is here to testify of it so as you can see HSL5 HLS3 and so on<br>因为由甘斯所释放出来的能量直通心灵,它影响一切,这些瓶子,丹尼尔正在测试它们,你可以看到hsl5 hls3等等</p>
<p>We give large samples that he said it was so plenty that he couldn’t match the number of petri dishes that we have in the lab we have go out look for some more, .<br>我们提供了大量样本,他说这非常多,无法与我们在些实验室的培养皿相匹配,</p>
<p>you know for him to analyze the stock for us. As you can see, this are the Petri dishes that in compaction period. I will hand this over to Daniel as he is dealing with<br>这些库存用于测试分析,如你所见,这是正对比斯的培养皿,我把这交给丹尼尔,由他负责与微生物学家一起处理</p>
<p>02:04-02:05<br>the microbiology aspect of it and we will see how effectively the GANS behaves on the packages. Taking about packages ? into details about the package .We are dealing with E.coli, salmonella or typhi which can affect human being ,<br>我们将看到包装内甘斯的效果,为详细了解里面的甘斯,我们把大肠杆菌、沙门氏菌、伤寒杆菌等能影响人的细菌加入测试中</p>
<p>That is what Daniel will share with us in the next cooper oxide so that you can have it .Dr. Nash is also around now .I hand in over to Daniel<br>这就是丹尼尔接下来将与我们分享的氧化铜甘斯,你可以了解这方面的知识,纳什博士在这里了,我的屏幕布交给丹尼尔</p>

<p>Screen:Preparation of antibacterial stock solutions抗菌库存溶液制备<br>Three concentrations 10%,30% and 50% were prepared from each soap by dissolving approximately 10,30 and 50 grams of the various soaps in to 100ml sterile distilled water in a 250 ml container covered and left over night to ensure complete dissolution .<br>屏幕：用一个250毫升的容器装100ml无菌蒸馏水把三种10,30和50克的各种皂分别溶解成浓度10%，30%和50%，剩下留置过夜确保完全溶解</p>
<p>In that on a micro staphylococcus they are classic, they are not ？They are two types we have streptococcus which is in a and staphylococcus that is how we different them (the grape-like clusters of the one).<br>这是一种典型的微型葡萄球菌,它们有两种,链球菌和金黄色葡萄球菌,这是它们的区别（葡萄球菌像一团簇）</p>
<p>This is how the E.coli looks like is the most prevalent infecting organism in the family of gram-negative bacteria known as Enterobacteriaceae<br>这是大肠杆菌的样子,是最常见的革兰氏阴性细菌感染,已知为肠杆菌科</p>
<p>Enterobacteriaceae are microorganism that is farmed in the intersides in of both humans and animals. Then this is also salmonella Typhi very effectials organism .<br>肠杆菌科细菌的微生物,存在于人类和动物体内,那么这是伤寒沙门氏菌有效的有机体</p>
<p>ok so this is how the work were done .We prepare 3 concentration from each soap product what we 10% 30% 50%<br>好的,这是我们的工作方法,每个肥皂产品准备了10% 30% 50%三个浓度</p>
<p>02:07-02:08<br>Antimicrobiar Susceptibility Testing<br>抗微生物敏感性测试</p>
<p>Screen:1ml of each of the test organisms was aseptically transferred into the various concentrations of 10% 30%and 50% and left 15 minutes as the killing time .<br>1ml各试验菌转移成10%，30%和50%不同浓度的无菌微生物 消耗时间为15分钟左右</p>
<p>Each concentration was re-suspended with the aid of a vortex mixture to re-suspend particles that may have settled out during the killing time (15 min)<br>在涡流混合物的帮助下每个浓度被重新悬浮 颗粒悬浮 细菌能在15分钟内被消耗掉</p>
<p>A twofold dilution was obtained by aseptically transferring 1ml of each stock antibacterial solution into Mc Cartney bottle containing 9ml peptone salt water<br>1ml各股抗菌溶液通过双重稀释转移为Mc Cartney瓶得到含9ml无菌蛋白胨盐水</p>
<p>1ml of each dilutions was aseptically transferred into sterile well labelled petri dishes (double trial for each dilution), starting from the highest dilution.<br>About 15mL of XLD,BP and EMB agar were poured on salmonella .<br>从最高浓度开始稀释,每1ml稀释无菌转移到无菌培养皿并标记（每个进行两道程序稀释）,把约15ml XLD,BP和EMB琼脂倒在沙门氏菌</p>
<p>Staphylococcus and Escherichia coli respectively and swirled gently to mix left for about 15 minutes to solidify,The plates were incubat aerobically at 37C +-2 for 24 hours<br>金黄色葡萄球菌和大肠杆菌轻轻混合分别左盘旋约15分钟后凝固,培养皿进行24小时37±2下无菌培育</p>
<p>Were prepared by dissolving we dissolve the eminar at red note of the dissolv water in a ? mil container, and we left them overnight to dissolve completely<br>我们在？毫升的容器中进行溶解,静置一晚上以便完全溶解</p>
<p>So after the preparation leaving them over night to dissolve we add it 1ml of the test of organism that we used for the test and the test organism we prepare on the noculunde??,noculum were prepare with the mafhlungs?? then that which is usually of one point 2 times 8 depart 8<br>随后加入1ml溶解微生物进行测试,我们准备在noculunde？？noculum与mafhlungs准备？.</p>
<p>That is a lot of micro organism .We prepare the ?? McCartney bottles ,prepare the each direction of it 2-4 direction<br>有大量微生物,我们准备好？瓶,每个准备2-4方向？？</p>
<p>02:08-02:09</p>
<p>Checking for Results After 24 Hours<br>24小时后结果检查</p>
<p>Pure colonies of salmonella appears red with or without a distinct black spot at the centre on XLD<br>纯沙门氏菌出现红点或明显不在XLD中心的黑点</p>
<p>Typical staphylococcus aureus colonies appears black with a clear zone surrounding on BP agar .<br>典型的金黄色葡萄球菌菌落呈黑色,周围有一个清晰的区域,在血压琼脂</p>
<p>After 24hours no colonies found<br>24小时后没有发现菌落群</p>
<p>They are showing Banjamin give me that the soaps are very fatty, so it depends only to 2-4 directions and to my supplys after I killing time of 15 miniutes<br>他们用本杰明给我肥皂在展示,里面含高脂肪,所以取决于2-4方向及15分钟消耗时间后的供应 ？？</p>
<p>All the organisms were limited as soon in the place, we are 15%, 10% and 30% this are the three represent for ?? all of them were limited.<br>所有的微生物是有限的,我们是15%，10%和30%，这是三个代表？？他们都是有限的,</p>
<p>So pure colonics of salmonella appears red that is went if they are I have this is salmonella appears with or without a distinct black spot at the centre on XLD .XLD is the media of salmonella colo s???? .<br>所以这样看来，纯沙门氏菌显示红色,沙门氏菌的出现或不在XLD中心明显的黑色斑点。XLD是沙门氏菌结的媒体？？？？。</p>
<p>02:09-02:10</p>
<p>Then typical colonies staphylococcus aureus also apprear black with the clear zone around on the media back ? BP agar..So this is a results for all the,<br>the sources were 3 .<br>然后典型的金黄色葡萄球菌菌落也出现明显黑色区域在？？的媒体,所以这是一个结果所有三个来源的结果</p>
<p>So we prepare 3 concentrations from each, 50%, 10% and 30% that for HSL1 .The quantity was not up to Pure colonies of salmonella appear red with or without a distinct black spot at the center on KLO.<br>每种我们准备了50%，10%和30%3种浓度—HSL,数量达不到纯沙门氏菌落出现红色或明显不在中心的黑点</p>
<p>Then the typical staphylococcus aureus colonies appear black with a clear zone surrounding on<br>典型的金黄色葡萄球菌菌落呈黑色,周围有一个清晰的区域.</p>
<p>02:10-02:11<br>D: Nothing was test, we see 0 0 0 .<br>医生：没测到什么 我们看到0 0 0</p>
<p>K: Excuse me .can you back what does this mean the application after 15 minutes? Show no E.coli, no salmonella or staphylococcus and it doesn’t matter which soap you used? Which concentration<br>K：对不起 能倒回来吗？这是什么意思？15分钟后结果？显示没有大肠杆菌 没有沙门氏菌或葡萄球菌 跟你使用的肥皂浓度和肥皂种类没有关系吗？</p>
<p>D: Yes. It does not matter which concentration or which soap. With the liquid one in the lab now , we are going to reduce the concentration to 5, 10 and 15% to see if it is still effective.<br>D：是的,什么浓度或哪种肥皂并没有关系,现在实验室中的液体肥皂,我们将减少把浓度坚守到为5 10和15% 看看它是否仍然有效,</p>
<p>D: We will reduce the concentration of the GANS that is added to the soaps to see the minimum effects.<br>D: 我们将减少甘斯添加肥皂的浓度看它的最低效果</p>
<p>02:11-02:12</p>
<p>D:So for this one the minimum effects were 10%.<br>D：所以这一次的最低有效性为10%</p>
<p>K: Your total residue was zero and you couldn’t find any?<br>K：你的总残留量为零,你找不到吗</p>
<p>D: Yes, that is correct. So that is the conclusion<br>D: 是的,那是正确的,因此,这是结论</p>
<p>K: Can you tell us what your conclusion is?<br>K：你能告诉我们你的结论是什么吗？</p>
<p>D: From the results it is very obvious that the soap is very effective. So as I said we are going to reduce the GANS to see how effective it will be.<br>D：从结果看很明显,肥皂非常有效,所以我说我们要减少甘斯看效果又将是怎样的</p>
<p>02:12-02:13</p>
<p>I understand this one to add it 1 ml of the Gans so we are reduce it to 0.5 ml , in the next analysis see how we could go<br>我理解这一点然后添加1毫升的甘斯 然后把它它减少到0.5毫升 然后分析看下一步我们的方向</p>
<p>K: That is beautiful. Thank you very much .What is your conclusion. We saw the conclusion even back up<br>K：这很好,非常感谢你,你的结论是什么,我们看到的结论是</p>
<p>B:So the conclusion is that because this is proving to be effective and currently we are doing another test on the soap.<br>得出的结论是证明其是有效的,目前我们正在做另一个肥皂测试,</p>
<p>We have samples on the test in the lab of the liquid soap which is undergoing the similar analysis in the microbiology lab as explain.<br>我们在实验室中有液体肥皂样品,正如我们所解释的那样,在微生物实验室进行类似分析</p>
<p>Like you said we are reducing the sample of the quantity of the Gans used and we want to try the effectiveness<br>就像您说的我们减少甘斯的使用量样品以测试效果</p>
<p>02:13-02:14</p>
<p>We want to carry another sample where people wash their hands with the soap and then analyze the effectiveness. I will talk with the microbiology for the water we said<br>我们计划做另一个样品,人们用肥皂洗手,然后分析它有效性,我会和微生物家讨论并用我们说的甘斯水</p>
<p>We said the very best place to do this will be at the public toilets. We will take samples of the soap and wash and collect the sample and then analyze the water and see .before and after.<br>这项测试最好的地方是公共厕所,我们将拿肥皂样品,收集样品并对其进行分析</p>
<p>We will ask some people to wash their hands in the clean water before washing in the nano environment that no lose the environment and then test the effectiveness of this. So that is next step that we want to as part of Thursday ficasey of this for one’s nano want to do that<br>我们会要求一些人在干净水下洗手,在纳米环境下,然后测试这一点的有效性,所以,下一步 我们要在???这样做</p>
<p>02:14-02:15</p>
<p>The next Project is For the Treatment of Various Skin Ailments that we want to do .GANS based Coconut Oil Ointment GANS based Palm kernel Oil Ointment that is Armen’s project .<br>下一个我们想做的项目是为各种皮肤疾病进行,甘斯的椰子油软膏,甘斯的棕榈仁油软膏,这些是阿曼的项目</p>
<p>Which I will do it with Esa ,she just come in,Esa is here ,So that is what she is to be doing .So that is it Mr Keshe .Do you have any question ?<br>我将与爱莎一起完成,她刚进来,今天在这里, 这是爱莎要做的项目,凯史先生,您还有什么问题吗？</p>
<p>K:I have very big question .Please go back all the way to very first 2-3 frames of this presentation<br>K：我有一个很大的问题,请你返回到最早的第2-3页,这个演示文稿用于治疗各种皮肤疾病</p>
<p>02:15-02:16</p>
<p>K: Please go all the way back in the presentation to the beginning. Go to the frame with the soap-making process where you speak how you produce soap. What did you do?<br>K：请退回到开始介绍的页面,转到肥皂制作过程页面,讲一下如何生产肥皂,你做了什么？</p>
<p>02:16-02:17</p>
<p>Stay where you were ,just go back ,in your talks ,yes ,you are in the perfect frame .In the teaching you showed us history way that people add caustic to the fat, caustic to oil.<br>停在刚才的地方,倒回去,在你的展示中,是的,你在正确的页面上,在教学中,你展示了我们人类对脂肪腐蚀性石油的处理方式</p>
<p>So if you stand still with the present knowledge we have, man already has been in the GANS making system ,and nano-making system for centuries.<br>所以如果你学习我们目前的知识便知道,人类已经在甘斯制作系统有纳米制造系统几世纪</p>
<p>You add caustic to amino acid (fat) and now you understand. You go and get the water from the sea and you add NaOH to it to make what you call the sea GANS. Man has been making protein Gans for centuries .<br>在氨基酸中增加碱,现在你明白了,你取得海水添加氢氧化钠做成海水甘斯,人类几个世纪以来一直在制造蛋白质甘斯,</p>
<p>02:17-02:18<br>So is a type of nature Gans with amino acid ,if you go if you understood this now you understand we are all been Gans maker<br>所以是一种氨基酸性质的自然甘斯,如果你去理解这句话,我们都是甘斯生产者</p>
<p>where you’ve been nano-materials makers for centuries without knowing. The reason ,Do you understand this, Benjamin?.<br>在不知不觉中生产了纳米涂层材料数百年,你明白吗,本杰明</p>
<p>B:Yes I will add the contribution to it .If you watch the movie 5 Club when the main character was talking to his apprentice he went to where the lab to collect the fat of human beings.<br>是的,我打算加点知识做点贡献,在电影5个俱乐部中 当主角是在跟他的徒弟说话的时候 他去实验室收集人类脂肪</p>
<p>02:18-02:19</p>
<p>The 5 people when they got to this clinic, the fat was soaked and them that is what this guy used this preparing the soap and he sell the soap to the same people who get soap what we call it the beauty clinic to go attach the fat<br>5个人到这家诊所时,脂肪正在被浸泡,他们准备用这个做肥皂卖给那些需要的人,我们称之为与脂肪连接的美容诊所</p>
<p>They didn’t know the content of the soap. The apprentice was asking why do we used this thing .He said to make the best soap you need tallow (fat) of humans or animals.<br>他们不知道肥皂的组成,徒弟问我们为什么要用这些,他说做出最好的肥皂,需要用到人类或动物的油脂（脂肪）</p>
<p>And then when ? to see The Asian people discovered that in some part of rivers they were able to wash the clothes properly. Why?<br>然后,过段时间,亚洲人会发现,他们能够在河流洗衣服,为什么？</p>
<p>Because on the hills where the river through that is where the human sacrifices were done in those this. The ashes when it wave are carry along,mixed in the wood ash and they used it in forming soap.<br>因为在靠近河的山上,人类会烧灰烬,当灰烬在木灰中进行混合的时候,可以形成肥皂</p>
<p>02:19-02:20</p>
<p>And so that is how those push of the rivers full and they didn’t understand the principle .but they enter getting the soap get something to wash clothes .<br>并清洁这些河流,他们不明白原理,但他们得到肥皂可以清洗,如洗衣服</p>
<p>This knowledge are built with they like you. You just same time in moving but we human being refuse to learn and sometime when you tell people about the technology it looks so simple they begin to doubt it.<br>教学需要根据他们的兴趣开展,你同时在学习,但人类拒绝学习,某个时候, 当你告诉人们技术,看起来很简单,他们开始怀疑它</p>
<p>K: They doubt their own intelligence. I asked you to show this frame is that to show and expand on it as you are<br>克：他们怀疑自己的智慧,我让你展示这个框架是为了展示和扩大它 你是</p>
<p>02:20-02:21</p>
<p>that in fact soap is a GANS state of protein (the fat). Now it should have been no surprise why when you add another GANS to the present status of GANS you increase to higher than the protein itself.<br>事实上 肥皂是甘斯状态的蛋白质（脂肪）,现在应该不奇怪为什么当你添加一种甘斯到目前状态的甘斯会增加其蛋白质</p>
<p>That is why when you added CO2 when you added CUO or CH3 or worked on salmonella or the other bacterias, because the foundation of the soap you made was already amino acid based.<br>当添加二氧化碳,氧化铜或氢甘斯进去沙门氏菌或其他细菌时,你做的肥皂已经有氨基酸基础了</p>
<p>So all you need all you done you add additional energy in a way and you created a new ‘virus’. Because the amino acid GANS is still there<br>因此,你所需做的是用一种方式增加能量,你创造一个新的“病毒”,氨基酸甘斯仍然存在</p>
<p>02:21-02:22<br>which made the soap.Now you have made a virus which is stronger than salmonella and everything else. Now for the first time you understand why your soaps work kill bacteria<br>以这种方法制作肥皂 现在你已经做了一个比沙门氏菌和其他任何细菌都强的病毒,现在,你第一次明白为什么肥皂能对细菌有效</p>
<p>Because you have made a new virus which is the energy of the CO2 added it to the present GANS amino acid which you created.<br>二氧化碳能量加到你刚制作的氨基酸中,这样便制作了新的病毒</p>
<p>This is why it is so effective ,,in this new energy package you have created adding a GANS energy to another GANS energy it is more than what is held in the body of the man as viruses.<br>这是为什么它是高效的,新的创造的能量包把甘期斯从一种能量加到另一种能量中,这种能量比人体病毒多</p>
<p>That is why you see this structure. You can go to the minimal amount of GANS. Don’t use GANS in your next test—just use the water of the GANS.<br>这就是为什么你看到这个结构,你可以去取得甘斯最小量,在下一个测试不用甘斯只用甘斯水</p>
<p>02:22-02:23</p>
<p>Because now you have added it to the energy of the GANS of the amino acid which you call soap. So this for a lot of you becomes new knowledge ,why the GANS works on bacteria.<br>因为现在你已经把它加进氨基酸甘斯中,你称之为肥皂,这对你来说成为新知识,为什么甘斯对细菌起效果</p>
<p>This is what you show us today, I wish you could go directly South Slunier university to the professors in the biology lab and micro which they did the same test 2 years ago and came up with the same result.<br>这是你今天展示给我们的,我希望你能够直接去南部大学教授的生物实验,他们在两年前做了,得出了同样的结果,</p>
<p>But the WHO blocked them to come out with the technology which was given by Keshe Foundation to them to stop the E.coli and Ebola,<br>但凯史基金会提供给他们的技术被世界卫生组织阻止公开,这些技术可以用一结束大肠杆菌和埃博拉</p>
<p>and they will threatened to lose the seats of professor in university for the first time we see with the scientists like you in Ghana that<br>这将威胁他们失去大学教授位置,在加纳我们第一次看到像你这样的科学家</p>
<p>02:23-02:24</p>
<p>you are confirming what your colleagues in the South University(did) two years ago. And submit the presidential office to the world heath authority all the conference taking out they could not show such thing.<br>两年前与南方大学同事们确认这些事,并总统办公室向世界卫生管理局提交了报告， 所有的会议中都不能展示这些事</p>
<p>Now it is in the public. But we understand the way how it works.<br>现在我们把它展示在公众中,我们了解它的方式<br>,<br>The reason your scientists in the Atomic Research Lab see the reduction in all the viruses and bacterias is because any virus or bacteria has a base amino acid.<br>在原子研究实验室的科学家发现所有病毒及细菌的减少是因为它们有基氨基酸作基础</p>
<p>So with your soap you have already created a base amino acid, but adding another energy to it with your Gans of CO2, or CH3 or copper oxide, or any Gans you add to it,<br>用肥皂创建一个氨基酸基础,并用二氧化碳或氢或氧化铜甘斯增加能量,或添加其它任何甘斯,</p>
<p>the power of it becomes more than the bacteria or the virus which is in the stomach salmonella or whatever,<br>胃中的沙门氏菌或其它细菌的能量变得比细菌或病毒强</p>
<p>02:24-02:25</p>
<p>and the transfer of energy from one to one shows you the reduction total because you transfer energy from the bacteria or the virus which already have a common denominator of the amino acid of the protein.<br>从一个到另一个的能量转换显示总量在减少,因为你从细菌或病毒处转换能量,这些具有蛋白质氨基酸共同特性</p>
<p>K:This is how it works. Understand the science behind it .not just coming up with figures. Because when you understand it, you can explain it easily .Now you see why I asked to come to this.<br>K:这是它的工作方式,了解背后的科学,而不仅仅是数字,因为当你理解它,便可以容易地解释它,现在你明白为什么我要来做这个</p>
<p>This is what you need to do in the space. You have a common denominator; you are in the space lab of the Ghana Atomic Energy Authority that is where you work with .This are wasteful<br>这是你在太空中需要做的工作,一个共同的特性,在加纳原子能局的太空实验室,你工作的地方,</p>
<p>So then Ghana produces the first space ship into space, the knowledge go from Ghana Atomic Energy Group gives you a step forward to understand how to protect man in the space.<br>所以当加纳生产第一艘太空飞船进入太空时， 加纳原子能中心为你提供了一个知识增加的窗口,以了解如何在太空中保护人类</p>
<p>02:25-02:26</p>
<p>You need to have amino acid condition, power of strength in magnetic gravitational which you can add slightly more to it and you guarantee life.<br>你需要氨基酸的条件， 磁引力场的能量,可以稍微添加一点,保证它的活性,</p>
<p>You did not destroy the amino acid of the bacteria or the virus in your culture. All you have done is you depleted the energy of it that is why it is black.<br>不会破坏培养液中的细菌或含病毒的氨基酸,这里所做的一切是耗尽细菌的能量,这就是为什么它是黑色的</p>
<p>That is why you still see it and it doesn’t there. If you take the residue of the culture plates which you have which Dr.Nash in other teaching just explained to us and analyze it,<br>这就是为什么你仍然看到它,它并不存在,把培养皿中的残渣留下来 纳什博士在其他教学中解释过,分析它</p>
<p>you will find out that it is a pure amino acid. That’s you haven’t destroyed it; you depleted the energy. This is what we call the space technology understanding the transfer of energy of the plasma.<br>你会发现,它是纯粹的氨基酸,在这个过程中没有摧毁它,只是耗尽了细菌能量,这就是我们所说的空间技术,需要理解等离子体能量的转换</p>
<p>02:26-02:27</p>
<p>In a simple way with the soap you brought fantastic new knowledge in the world of space technology.<br>用肥皂以一个简单的方法带你到航天技术世界感受奇妙的新知识</p>
<p>K: This is what your scientists in the lab have to understand and start working on. This is what you need. Do you understand?<br>K：这是实验室里的科学家所必须了解和开始研究的,是你所需要的,你明白吗？</p>
<p>Bejamin are you with us? Now you have to ask as a man who understands plasma, Gans and nanotechnology transfer this knowledge to the scientists in the Ghana Space Institute and the biology lab,Explain to them and they are sitting with you .<br>本杰明,还在线吗？现在你要问那些能理解等离子体的人 向加纳空间研究所的科学家和生物实验室转移甘斯和纳米技术知识,向他们解释,他们与你们在一起,</p>
<p>02:27-02:28</p>
<p>We thank you for the knowledge you brought us and we thank you for what you share in the purity of the knowledge we just add to it.<br>我们谢谢你给我们分享的知识,我们感谢你分享知识的纯粹性,通过这样我们增加了知识内容</p>
<p>And now it should be very easy even if you add a small amount ,let’s say half percent of soap if the energy of that half percent is more than the bacteria’s which they have in the sample test,<br>现在添加非常小量应该是很容易的,大概半个百分点,肥皂如果半个百分点的能量将超过测试样本中的细菌</p>
<p>they will share energy,you will still have amino acid. Please test the residue which you left there which you say they are black.<br>它们会分享能量,你仍将有氨基酸,请测试你留下的残留物,这些看起来是黑色的</p>
<p>Those will show in tests to be a pure amino acids in nano-structure themselves. Is it possible to do that do you have the facility to do that Benjamin They have connection issue<br>这些将显示在测试中,本身是纯粹的纳米结构氨基酸,这样做是可行的,本杰明,你们有设备完成这些测试吗？本杰明,他们可能掉线了</p>
<p>02:28-02:29</p>
<p>B: We lost you for some couple of minutes. So would you repeat please you question?<br>B 凯史先生,我们掉线几分钟,可以请您重复您的问题吗？</p>
<p>K: ok,what it is your job now you understand that you has been producing human race have been producing the Gans of protein and now you added the Gans of another material<br>K：好的， 你现在的工作是去理解生产的人类蛋白质甘斯及为了提高它的强度添加另一种物质的甘斯</p>
<p>to increase its strength in the way you make the virus to with it you created a safe virus which we control is be in the nano-structure that it could be depleted the energy of the other virus being Ebola<br>你生产一种安全病毒,我们控制在纳米结构,它可以耗尽其他病毒能量,如埃博拉病毒 大肠杆菌 沙门氏菌,</p>
<p>, E.coli, salmonella. It will be interesting if you can take those black spots what you say there is no culture and see if still the amino acid without the energy of the virus or bacteria.<br>这将是有趣的,你看到这些黑点但看起来没有底液,看看没有能量的病毒或细菌是不是仍然为氨基酸</p>
<p>02:29-02:30</p>
<p>This confirms the correctness of the technology that you are depleting the energy. So, we can use soap, literally,caustic or ash with human protein or any kind of protein<br>能量的转换或消耗证实了技术的正确性,因此,我们可以使用肥皂,烧碱或灰与人类蛋白质或任何种类蛋白质</p>
<p>and add a small amount of energy to it which is safe for us to overcome any virus or disease on this planet.<br>添加少量能量,这样是安全的,我们可以克服这个星球上任何病毒或疾病在</p>
<p>You can digest it; you can take use the GANS of the water use the water of the Gans of the soap and and the water of the GANS of what you made as soap<br>你可以消化它,可以用甘斯,用甘斯肥皂水</p>
<p>and take a spoon of it for any kind of salmonella which man takes within seconds or minutes you will see them finished with the (symptoms of) salmonella.<br>任何形式的沙门氏菌只用一茶匙,在几秒钟或几分钟内,你会看到沙门氏菌症状的消失</p>
<p>02:30-02:31</p>
<p>So the soap the way you made it and added CO2 if you test it as a water of Gans on the human body, you will find out salmonella will walk away in no time in few seconds.<br>肥皂的制作方法,如果你加入二氧化碳甘斯水用在身体上进行测试,你会发现沙门氏菌会在几秒内消失</p>
<p>If you have salmonella poisoning, eboli or E.coli or any kind of virus infection of any microbes or virus, just take the water of it.<br>如果你感染沙门氏菌中毒,埃博拉 大肠杆菌,任何微生物或病毒,只需用甘斯水即可</p>
<p>If it enters your digestive system, you can make these soaps as water which you made as patches and put it on the stomach. Put it on the digestive system.<br>如果它进入你的消化系统,可以用这些肥皂水,可以做的小包,把它放在肚子上,把它放在消化系统上</p>
<p>You don’t need to digest it. The energy transfer you will find out salmonella disappears no time.you understand ,are you there Benjamin<br>不需要消化它,能量直接转换掉,然后发现沙门氏菌消失了,你明白吗 ？ 本杰明还在吗？</p>
<p>02:31-02:32</p>
<p>B: I fully understand and that is why I told him that it will eliminate the pathogens or micro alkalis in no time. But he was a little bit skeptical at first. But after he said ,Daniel tell me that he was happy with the results.<br>B：我完全理解这是为什么 我告诉他 这将随时消除的病原体或微生物,他一开始有点怀疑,后来丹尼尔告诉我,看到这个结果他很高兴</p>
<p>K: You have to understand the process what is happening not the results. So you can repeat the process with the GANS and the CO2 in the patches the way you make them.<br>K：你必须了解正在发生的事情,而不是结果,所以你可以用甘斯和在包内放甘斯,用这种方式 你可以帮助任何</p>
<p>Anybody who suffers from eboli, E.coli, salmonella or any other infection that you can put it on their body and the energy transfer will do the same thing without digesting it or using it.<br>感染埃搏拉,大肠杆菌,沙门氏菌或其他病毒的人,你可以把它放在他们身上,这样做了同样的事情能量转换了但不消化掉它</p>
<p>So it will be interesting if you put this culture material and don’t mix with it any of the soap,<br>因此,这非常有趣,如果在这种培养液底料,不要与任何肥皂混合</p>
<p>02:32-02:33</p>
<p>Put it in the environment of the soap and see if anything happens to the bacteria. You understand ,So you don’t mix your culture with the soap;<br>把细菌放在肥皂的环境中 看看会有什么情况发生,你明白,不要用肥皂混合你的底液</p>
<p>you put the culture with the bacteria and virus in it in the soap which is already Co2 or copper oxide or whatever with the soap and see if the bacteria changes and becomes ineffective.<br>把底液与细菌 病毒放在肥皂中 这些是二氧化碳甘斯或铜氧化物与肥皂的混合 看看细菌的变化,观察它被消除</p>
<p>We do not need to eat it or drink it; we use its energy to see the conversion. Is that possible?<br>我们不需要吃它 也不需要喝它 我们用它的能量去看它的转换,这是可能的吗？</p>
<p>B: Yes, it’s possible.<br>B是的 这是可能的,</p>
<p>K: Or, just rub the soap on the culture box and see if the bacteria start disappearing where you only left the amino acid.<br>K：或只是在培养箱上擦肥皂,看到细菌开始消失并只留下氨基酸</p>
<p>Make the soap and drop the culture to box in it and let it float without soap penetrating into the culture plate. Let us know.<br>制作肥皂,把培养液放进盒子里,让它漂浮在没有肥皂渗透的培养盘上,让我们知道一下结果</p>
<p>02:33-02:34</p>
<p>Anli:Mr Keshe this is Anli speaking do you want talking about the diamond I want to show something<br>A：凯史先生您好 我是安利 您有讨论到钻石,我想展示一些</p>
<p>K,no we are not going there skip it out So what is important is to transfer the energy of the GANS, not the GANS itself. You understand?<br>K: 喔 不 我们并不往这个方向讨论,先打住, 所以最重要的是甘斯能量的转换 不是甘斯本身,你明白吗</p>
<p>So please come back to us if the result is correct or how much you have to increase the intensity. But don’t forget some culture plates that are glass or plastic will not absorb some of the energy.<br>因此,请回到我们刚才说的,如果结果是正确的,或者多少增加的强度,但不要忘了培养液盘子是塑料或玻璃将不会吸收能量</p>
<p>This is very important and we see this when we create plasmatic fields. When you use plasma<br>这非常重要,当我们创建等离子场,当使用等离子</p>
<p>02:34-02:35</p>
<p>it depends on whether you use glass or plastic and different strength fields interact. So you don’t need to have the soap; you can even make the water of the soap.<br>取决于你是否用玻璃或塑料和不同场强相互作用,所以你不需要肥皂,你甚至制作肥皂水</p>
<p>The water of the GANS on the top when you mix it, let the water settle. And if anyone has salmonella or E.coli, you should see instantaneously the reduction<br>当你搅拌甘斯水顶端,然后静置水,如果任何人感染沙门氏菌或大肠杆菌,应该看到即时的微生物或病毒减少</p>
<p>and transfer of the micro or virus into only protein where the energy is transferred into the plasma of the rest of the GANS which you do. You don’t kill they in bacteria and don’t destroy the bacteria.<br>微生物或病毒转换成蛋白质的能量,这些能量被其余甘斯能量转换成等离子体, 你不需通过杀或摧毁细菌达到治疗效果</p>
<p>This is one of the things we always had a huge problem with nuclear centers. When they do their inspection copy they don’t see the energy;<br>这是一直以来核能中心的其中一个巨大问题,当他们生复检查时他们看不到能量</p>
<p>they see the effect of the energy and they see the material but we don’t see anything different because GANS transfers energy<br>他们看到能量的效果,看到材料料,我们没有看到什么不同因为甘斯转换了能量</p>
<p>02:35-02:36</p>
<p>K:because it is a plasma. Do some tests for us and come back because this takes 5 minutes to do this test.<br>K:因为它是一种等离子体,做一些测试然后反馈回来,因为测试需要花5分钟时间</p>
<p>B: it is not me; it’s Daniel. Daniel have lot of work but he can do it quickly for us but sometimes he is not loaded with a lot of jobs.<br>Get him do some of this for us<br>B: 不是我,是丹尼尔,丹尼尔有许多工作,但他能很快的做完,有些时候他的工作内容太多负担太重</p>
<p>K: Pull him into the Keshe Foundation side of the research,then you have him all the time.<br>K：把他拉到凯史基金会研究团队,然后他所有的时间都属于你的</p>
<p>Now you are part of the structure of Ghana atomic we are embed as company in there getting done moving into the Keshe Foundation as side of the what we call it the institute ,and then it will be yours,<br>现在你的团队是加纳原子中心的一部份， 并与公司相嵌入,这凯史基金会和他们正在做的事情,称之为机构,然后这属于你,</p>
<p>02:36-02:37</p>
<p>B:Do you of more question<br>B 请问您还有其它问题吗</p>
<p>K:The Skin of Nash<br>K 纳什的皮肤</p>
<p>B: Dr. Nash is here.<br>B：纳什在这里</p>
<p>K: Can we see his hand where it was burned?<br>K：我们可以看下他烧伤的手吗？</p>
<p>B:Mr Keshe Nash is here （adjust the camera）<br>B：纳什博士在这里(调整视频)</p>
<p>02:37-02:38<br>K: see the picture ,Rick Is that outside or inside<br>K 看下屏幕 是内部还是外部</p>
<p>N:video Zoom here<br>Dr.Nash shows his burn (2.37.28)<br>纳什展示他的手</p>
<p>B: That is Dr. Nash’s hand of Nash which was treated was Gans ,he is here so he can tell you<br>B：这是纳什的手,用甘斯治疗,他可以告诉你情况</p>
<p>Dr. N: As you can see in the picture my hand is almost taking the natural skin color.<br>N：正如你所看到,我的手几乎是自然肤色</p>
<p>K:we see your elbow and arm,Tell us what happen<br>K：我们看到你的肘部和手臂,告诉我们发生什么事了</p>
<p>02:38-02:39</p>
<p>Dr.N:Yes after I sustain Ben . Ben come around , I showed him the burn and he said it could be treated in a matter of days ,<br>N,我叫本,本过来,我把手给他看,他说这个可以在几天内治好</p>
<p>So every day he comes from to treats my hand and just the second day such thing changes And as you can see now ,my skin the place has turn up with my nature skin<br>然后他每天过来治疗我的手,只是第二天就发生了好转,你可以看到,这块地方已经转变为自然肤色</p>
<p>and leave the head there which use those to ground us before is now green fast I can see .So actually the GANS are works and so marvelous.<br>剩下这里这块,所以甘斯是很有效,不可思议的</p>
<p>and if I show my hand to someone that that is where I have the accidents ,they said they don’t believe ,<br>如果我给朋友们看我的手,这是我遭遇意外的地方,他们说他们不相信</p>
<p>K:What was the accident<br>K:是什么意外</p>
<p>02:39-02:40</p>
<p>Dr.N :Yes I was driving and when I veered off the road, hit two other cars by the root side and my hand was on the steering wheel.<br>N: 我开车的时候偏离了公路， 撞上路边的另外两辆车,我的手在方向盘上</p>
<p>So when the air bags popped up Because my hand was the first or the nearest object to the air bag it is crushed roll back of my arm getting to the main win<br>that they actual the going be so merciful I didn’t touch y win so I didn’t blit,that I sustained severe band at that partial of my handful<br>所以,当气囊弹出 因为我的手第一个或最接近气囊,于是撞伤了我的胳膊,治疗时在部份手上做了绷带,<br>,<br>K:So how long is that<br>K:这样多久了</p>
<p>D:urns on my hand and I had the accident Jan. 25 this year and they treated it for 5 days.<br>D：今年1月25日的事,他们这样治疗了6天</p>
<p>K:So since January there was no change.<br>K：那么从一月起就没有变化,</p>
<p>02:40-02:41</p>
<p>Dr. N.:Yes after this ,so the so I have been healed than the skin I thought ,yeah I though our cleaning together,I used the GANS treatment for just 5 days. It move across It started creating natural skin from then on.<br>N：我用甘斯治疗仅仅5天 ，从那时起的天然皮肤开始长出来</p>
<p>K: Benjamin you need to buy two headphone that you don’t need to start this .Thank you very much for sharing knowledge for us Let us know when you do the tests.<br>K:本杰明你需要买两个耳机， 那就不用这样做了,非常感谢今天的知识分享,让我们看看你什么时候做测试</p>
<p>B: I don’t know if anyone has questions to ask. There are students from various universities.<br>B: 我不知道有人有问题要问， 这里有来自不同大学的学生在这里做实习</p>
<p>02:41-02:42</p>
<p>B：(introduce team member) attachments ,internship they are from college most of team member are here,<br>B （介绍团队成员）这是来自学校的实习生,大部份团队成员都在这里</p>
<p>K: Would you like to make the announcement or I will make the announcement<br>K：你想宣布这个消息吗？</p>
<p>B: I would prefer you do that.(introduce team member)<br>B 由您来宣布更佳（介绍团队成员）</p>
<p>02:42-02:43<br>B：Nafisa is her ,Nafisa wave your hand for them to see ,they were all part of the soap making process Nash is here is around ,ok,So that’s my team here<br>B: 这是纳菲撒,纳莫撒请挥下你的手让大家看到,这些是肥皂团队的成员,纳什也在这,这是我的团队</p>
<p>K: Thank you very much.As I said the African nations will lead the space technology and we see now ,<br>K:非常感谢,正如我所说现在我们可以看到,非洲国家将带领空间技术,</p>
<p>you bring knowledge so freely unconditioned of patterns and scientific papers you show the raw state of matter and I show you one thing ,<br>你自由地无条件地分享知识,展示你的科学论文和物质的原始状态</p>
<p>hundreds of thousands of the scientists around the world watch this program .You are watched by world leaders .Today what you are present and they are understanding how easily we share knowledge in this foundation and I thank you for doing this.<br>我告诉你一件事,成千上万的科学家和世界领导人今天观看这个节目,你处于世界领导人的监视之下,今天我们展示这些知识是多么地简单 我感谢你为此做的努力</p>
<p>02:43-02:44</p>
<p>But we have a surprise for you. In August 2016 Keshe Foundation will hold a conference in Ghana for the all the African nations<br>但我们有一个惊喜送给你,2016八月凯史基金会将在加纳为所有非洲国家举办分议</p>
<p>so all the African Keshe Foundations in having problems in getting visas to come to Europe, we organize first ,<br>如果所有非洲凯史基金获得从欧洲来的签证,我们首先组织,</p>
<p>Keshe foundation submit in Ganaha with the help of the ? Keshe Foundation and is on the ? of Benjamin, Alexz and Dr.Bruta to see this through. This is the first time we organize in Africa and we organize it in the center of Africa.<br>本杰明 阿力克兹等的协助下加纳凯史基金会召开次会议 这是我们第一次在非洲组织会议,在非洲中心的会议</p>
<p>B: So Mr Keshe ,The people want to know what do I know what we are going to discuss in the summit,they want to know what the summit is all about<br>B：所以凯史先生 人们想知道怎么了解我们在会议上要讨论的内容,他们想了解会议的所有资讯</p>
<p>02:44-02:45</p>
<p>K: We will release it; it is scientific and it is for Ghana to enter into space technology just the way you are doing it. we will try to be there and try to be Gahan for the submit and at the same time by then<br>我们将释放这项技术,它是科学的,和你所做的一样这是加纳进入太空技术的方式,我们将试着尽量将加纳的提交并在同一时间</p>
<p>we should be able to see different applications on the space technology and the health.,We came to Ghana through Dr. Manna<br>届时我们将看到在航天技术和健康的不同应用,我们通过曼纳博士来到加纳博士,</p>
<p>where as part of the spaceship program of the Ghana government. Now we bring the knowledge that Ghana can join China and the others in the space as you done.<br>这是加纳政府太空飞船计划的一部分,现在我们带来的知识 加纳可以加入这些知识, 中国和其他你们所做的太空项目也可以加入</p>
<p>The beauty of this is that you don’t realize what you just express as knowledge in past hour. You opened the biggest mystery of man for 6000 years how this works so simply.<br>你在过去一小时里没有意识到这些知识的美妙,你打开了人类6000年来最大的神秘,这是多么简单的工作</p>
<p>02:45-02:46</p>
<p>It is not what you bring as pieces of paper or cultures. It is the knowledge which you share so unconditionally. Now we can see this paper you just shown this simple presentation by such we put scientist (02:45:20),.<br>这不是你给大家带来纸或文化,是你无条件分享的知识,你和我们分享的这篇文章是你跟科学家们的简单介绍</p>
<p>This broke all the rules of the present economic cycle. What you just showed how easily that this bacteria can be defeated. This advance has been the dream of the world of medicine.<br>这打破了目前所有经济周期规则,可以容易地显示细菌被打败,这种进步是医学界的梦想</p>
<p>Thousands of people die because of these bacteria every day around the world –salmonella and the others. With this simple presentation you have brought everything to a stop.<br>每天世界各地成千上万的人死于这些细菌 沙门氏菌及其它,有了这个简单的演示,你把一切都终结了</p>
<p>The knowledge you shared in the past hour has been the dream of humanity to solve for thousands of years. And you have done this so humbly you’ve done<br>在过去的一个小时里， 你所分享的知识是人类几千年来的梦想,如此谦卑地你做到了</p>
<p>02:46-02:47</p>
<p>Today microbiologist and the leading pharmaceutical organizations around the world are kicking themselves. Their terms of saying, ‘things are finished’…<br>今天世界上的微生物学家和全球领先的制药企业在对自己生气,以他们说法是“事情都完了”</p>
<p>Ghana comes on presentation and you have been watched by the world leaders I’ve show you today ,<br>加纳今天来作展示并一直被世界领导人监察,就象今天的展示,</p>
<p>the program you present have been watched by President Obama. The Chinese leadership is online most of the time.<br>正在被奥巴马总统观看,中国的领导层大部分时间都是在线的</p>
<p>Are you still there ,you have been watched by NASA, by the health authority organizations and by the most leading scientific organizations around the world.<br>你还在线吗？ 你已经被美国航空航天局 卫生管理局组织和世界上最领先的科学组织一直监察,</p>
<p>We speak to them and we know they are online. We monitor them. In a very simple way you shown there is no need for peer review to control.<br>我们对他们说话， 我们知道他们是在线的,我们监视他们,以一个非常简单的方式显示 没有必要对同行评审来控制,</p>
<p>02:47-02:48</p>
<p>You have destroyed half of the soap industry in the world and half of the pharmaceutical business in the world.<br>你已经摧毁了世界上一半肥皂工业和一半制药企业,</p>
<p>Where the man can make a caustic, we saw animal fat from the steak last night on the table have the caustic to cause the fat,<br>你可以做生产碱 ，昨晚我们看到桌上牛排的动物牛脂具有腐蚀性,产生脂肪</p>
<p>and little bit of oxide from the copper of the wire in the house, you can cure your salmonella, you can cure ebola and E.coli.<br>以及房中的一点氧化铜 ，可以用来治愈沙门氏菌 ，大肠杆菌和埃博拉</p>
<p>When your colleagues South University we told them how to make the same thing as we just showed us two years ago.<br>两年前我们向你南方大学的同事展示如何做同样的事情</p>
<p>And they took it to the presidential palace of the president of Salerno to show to the??? how easily E.coli and Ebola can be destroyed.<br>他们把它带到萨勒诺总统府去展示大肠杆菌和埃博拉病毒怎么被清除</p>
<p>They confiscated and the threatened to lose the position. Now you have shown that they cannot silence 20 beautiful scientists like you in Ghana.<br>他们没收并发出威胁,现在你已经表明,加纳20个象你这样美丽的科学家不能继续那样沉默</p>
<p>02:48-02:49</p>
<p>Now the whole world knows how correct the technology is because you presented it.<br>因你所分享的知识,现在全世界都知道这技术是多么正确</p>
<p>What you present in the past half hour and you have been worked in the past 6 weeks have taken scientists of world hundreds of years to solve.<br>过去半个小时的演讲,以及超过6个星期的工作 解决了科学家几百年来寻找答案的总是</p>
<p>And there it is if the pharmaceuticals understand it you do the tests with the energy just use it as a liquid soap as the liquid water of soap and use it<br>如以药品理解它,通电测试只是把它作为肥皂液体来使用</p>
<p>and you will find out that no child in Africa should die of anymore bacteria and diseases. And Africa will head walking the man out of these diseases.<br>你会发现在非洲没有孩子应死于细菌和疾病,非洲把这些疾病从非洲人头上越走</p>
<p>This is what this beautiful thing is about this. But the most important part is understanding the principle behind it and how it is you produced the GANS of the amino acid<br>这是美好的事情,但最重要的是了解背后的原理及如何生产氨基酸甘斯</p>
<p>02:49-02:50</p>
<p>Which is the structure of the man? You produced and added a little bit stronger strength with the Ch2 or Co2<br>男人的结构是什么？加强一点的强度与CH2或CO2有关</p>
<p>and now that little bit of strength in the plasmatic condition is enough to deplete another amino acid with a little bit of strength we call salmonella or the other is killing you.<br>现在增加一点等离子体环境强度就足以清除被沙门氏菌感染的氨基酸或其它可以伤害你的细菌</p>
<p>You can actually work your children in Africa out of all disasters. No child<br>实际上你可以让孩子们远离非洲的所有灾难,不会有孩子受灾,</p>
<p>don’t forget if it have Alexz on the line with you ,doctors in Nigeria are doing the same thing as you do with GANS water.and people are walking away from malaria.<br>不要忘了如果你和Alexz在线上 尼日利亚的医生在做同样的事情应用甘斯水治疗疟疾感染</p>
<p>Try use the water of the soap you made and give it to the people who are malaria attack and watch how within twenty four hours they change their positions. Try it; test it on malaria and see how it works.<br>把肥皂水给感染疟疾的人， 并观察在24小时内, 这些病毒位置的改变,尝试并测试疟疾， 看看它们是如何工作的</p>
<p>02:50-02:51</p>
<p>Spray their rooms with the water of the soaps of these GANS and see if you can overcome malaria in no time. I lost my heart to Africa 25 years ago and I worked in Africa a long time.<br>用甘斯肥找水喷房间去观察能不能随时清理疟疾病毒,25年前我把心留在了非洲,我在非洲工作了很长一段时间</p>
<p>I have seen how my workers suffered from malaria and now you have the solution. I worked in Gambia<br>我的工人们很容易患上疟疾,现在你有解决方法,我在冈比亚工作</p>
<p>and I have seen my people how they suffer and they could not afford to pay for injections of malaria.<br>我看到工人们因此受苦去无法支付注射治疗疟疾的钱</p>
<p>Now you can give them the water cost nothing, they can walk away with no suffering. I have seen the same thing in??? for years.<br>现在你可以给他们零成本制作的甘斯水， 他们可以从病毒中解脱出来自由行走,多年来同样的状况一直在发生</p>
<p>It is time for Ghana Space Institute and Ghana Atomic to deliver the first material against malaria and all the diseases which have been suffering where cause problem in Africa. I thank you for what you delivered.<br>加纳太空研究所和加纳原子能中心是时候提供第一种对抗疟疾及所有其它令非洲深受其害的疾病的产品了,我感谢你所提供的支持</p>
<p>02:51-02:52</p>
<p>I want to try it with the veterinary people there is a veterinary unit of the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission. I am trying to work with the animals.also<br>加纳原子能委员会有一个兽医团队,我打算和他们一起把技术应用在动物上</p>
<p>it is something that I am doing with anyone to break the ice until you brought it in. The best thing are we doing with the veterinary people here.they have a lot of animals<br>用这种方式打破技术引进中面临的僵局,最好是我们与兽医一起工作,这里有很多动物</p>
<p>so animals respond to treatment even faster than human beings because they have no attachments what’s ever.<br>所以动物对治疗的反应比人类更快 ，因为他们没有什么执着</p>
<p>I am going to do that with the veterinary unit for the animal health and I will give you feedback for what I find<br>未来我们将与兽医团队合作,然后给您反馈我们的研究成果</p>
<p>K: That is perfect. Let me ask you to one more thing ,You can use the same material in agriculture for pest control without chemicals. You don’t destroy the life of the whatever;<br>非常好,让我再告诉你一件事,可以在农业中使用同种材料控制害虫而不用化学物,并不会会破坏任何生命体</p>
<p>02:52-02:53</p>
<p>you change the environment that they cannot exist there. You have to understand how it works. When you use this water of this soap in the fields in agriculture side,<br>改变了环境它们便无法生存,去了解它是如何工作的,当在农业领域应用这些肥皂水时</p>
<p>they just change the field strength, the same you did with the bacteria, salmonella and the rest. So in that environment, the pests cannot exist so you don’t need to use the chemicals you use the same water.<br>它们只是改变了场强 同样的效果会在细菌上体现,沙门氏菌和其它细菌,因此,此环境下害虫无法生存 那么以水替代即可而无需使用化学物质</p>
<p>You can extend the knowledge; we done this as we done in Brazil and in China. Very soon the Chinese scientists will bring this knowledge in. So now you understand how it works it just transfer the energy you create a new environment.<br>你可以扩展知识,在巴西和中国我们也以同样方式进行,很快,中国科学家将参与这方面知识,所以现在你明白它如何工作,你创造了一个新的环境,而它只是转移了能量</p>
<p>You can use it with anything, today we announce the establishment of agriculture at KesheFoundation.org headed by Dr. Bhuta in Kenya has been asked the website be set<br>你可以用任何东西来发展这项技术,今天我们宣布在凯史基金会官网上建立农业板块,由来自肯尼亚的普达博士带领,并将丰富网站农业内容</p>
<p>02:53-02:54</p>
<p>From next Wednesday or the Wednesday after,we teach on Wednesday mornings to the agriculture scientists,<br>如果你参与非洲或世界其他地方的农业,从下星期三开始我们会于每周三上午增加农业科学家教学</p>
<p>If you are involved in agriculture in Africa or anywhere else in the world, the way we are teaching doctors on Wednesday afternoons,then we start teaching the agriculturalists<br>与星期三下午医疗教学相同,我们开始教授农学家</p>
<p>Because we ask you to come in and bring your technology that we can share. The teachings that will be headed by Dr. Bhuta and as I said we bring in leading scientists around the world to head different sections of Keshe Foundation.<br>那么我们请你来,把你的技术进行分享和教导,普达博士将带领农业教学,在凯史基金会带领世界各地不同领域的顶尖科学家</p>
<p>And now it will be done from Kenya. Dr. Bhuta is coming soon to Ghana very soon to be with you to share knowledge he is a well-respected researcher and developer in agriculture side.<br>现在它由肯尼亚来完成,普达博士将很快来到加纳与你们一起分享知识,他是一位受人尊敬农业领域的研究学者</p>
<p> Understand the technology you just develop and shared with us so freely and beautifully with him then will get in the agriculture.<br>一起去理解你研究的技术并自由无顾虑地分享出来,然后把它应用在在农业上</p>
<p>02:54-02:55</p>
<p>Then you understand you don’t need to bring any fertilizer or pesticides from anywhere around the world. Ghana will export water out of Ghana to its own culture<br>然后你明白你不需要从世界任何地方进口任何肥料或杀虫剂,加纳将以自身的文化出口水给世界</p>
<p>Understand the principles and technology and the physiology of the interaction of creating new environments .now you can become ‘astronauts’ in no time.<br>了解创造新环境相互作用的原理， 技术， 及生理机能,现在你可以在任何时候成为“宇航员”,</p>
<p>You develop it, you play with the same energy in creating lift and motion. When I met Dr. Gahanna in Italy last year in the conference of peace .<br>研发这项技术,用相同的能量创造飞升和运动,当我在去意大利的和平会议上遇到杰汉奈博士时</p>
<p>I explained to her we bring Ghana and Africa to be the crown jewel of space technology. And today is an example of it.<br>我向她解释说,加纳和非洲是太空技术王冠上的明珠,今天是其中一个例子</p>
<p>02:55-02:56</p>
<p>So unconditionally So humbly you sit there and you have changed the course of humanity in a very simple presentation<br>所以,如此无条件地谦卑地坐在那里,通过简单介绍你已经改变了人类进程</p>
<p>If you had somebody from Harvard or Oxford, they would have been sitting there with tie expecting respect I know ‘too much’.<br>如果你有一个来自哈佛或牛津的人 他们会戴着领带以我知道“非学多”姿态一直坐在那里的</p>
<p>Africa is humble and we respect you for it. I hope we share more with you next week. Test it without the material. And on the other hand, on the Keshe Foundation Universal Council on the Facebook<br>非洲是谦卑的,我们尊重你,我希望我们下周能和你分享更多,没有材料的试验,另一方面,在脸谱网上的凯史基金会宇宙委员会</p>
<p>Caroline has already established a veterinarian section for those scientists who want to participate on that with their knowledge using the plasma technology to share with the others.<br>卡洛琳已经建立了一个科学家兽医部， 兽医部欢迎愿与他人分享等离子体技术并致力于研究应用知识的人</p>
<p>When you go to universal council, on the veterinarian section you can see how you can help your animals<br>在这里 ，你可以用你刚才分享的知识学习到如何帮助动物</p>
<p>02:56-02:57</p>
<p>using what you just shared. Thank you very much Benjamin.<br>非常感谢， 本杰明</p>
<p>B: Thank you .Mr Keshe ,Dr. Nash want to ask you a question.<br>B:谢谢凯史先生 纳什博士有问题想问您</p>
<p>K: Please<br>K：请问</p>
<p>Dr. Nash: Mr.Keshe, from today’s presentation on the soap and someone is diagnosed with the typhoid fever; can that person be treating using this technology?<br>N：凯史先生,从今天肥皂的展示来看,有些人被诊断为伤寒症,那么,他们可以用这项技术治疗吗</p>
<p>K: yes, immediately. This test on influenza and has been tested by Tepco Japanese Nuclear Center for helping their people in Fukushima in the winter colds.<br>K: 是的,尽快,流感测试已由日本东京电力公司核电中心完成了,它用来帮助福岛人抵御冬季感冒</p>
<p>All you need to do, and actually our Japan Keshe Foundation, Mr. Kansha, showed the research that was done by Tepco<br>你所需做的,其实我们日本凯史基金会,看山先生,已由东京电力公司得到研究结果</p>
<p>02:57-02:58</p>
<p>Where they put influenza on the foot of the mouse. And, afterwards there were no toxicity in the liver and there was no influenza. You can use it use the water of it.<br>他们把流感病毒放在老鼠脚上,然后,发现肝脏中不带毒性， 也没有流感,你可以用它来用它的水,</p>
<p>Use the water of the soap and not the GANS itself; GANS is too powerful.<br>使用肥皂水而不是甘斯,甘斯能量太强了</p>
<p>If you put 0.5 ml, you will get the same result you can see you bombarded those ‘poor bacteria’ in those plates by Hiroshima bomb. That is why they are not there.<br>0.5毫升的量会得到同样效果,你可以看到整个过程就象广岛原子弹那样轰炸这些“脆弱的细菌”</p>
<p>So what you got to understand dilute it with the water in the ratio of 10 to 1 of the soap with the CO2. Try to use CO2 GANS water first and see if you get the results.<br>所以你要了解的把肥皂与甘斯以1：10进行稀释,先用二氧化碳甘斯水看看你得到的结果,<br>02:58-02:59</p>
<p>You can use copper oxide GANS water with the soap and it will be very powerful; it will be a big punch. You understand .<br>你可以使用氧化铜甘斯水混在肥皂中,它会很强大,这将是很大能量流,你明白</p>
<p>So use this 3 times like 2 spoon tablespoons and 2 or 3 times a day. Slowly let the body take it.Don’t use the copper oxide water GANS; it’s too powerful and is a too big punch.<br>每天2或3次每次2汤匙,让身体对它有缓慢的接受过程,不要用氧化铜甘斯水,能量太强,对身体来讲冲击太大</p>
<p>And you can walk with it ,they will walk away from the typhoid. The research from Japan confirms your idea is correct because we have data and we know it works.<br>你可以试着用,慢慢地伤寒会远离, 来自日本的研究证实这些观点是正确, 我们有测试数据显示其行之有效</p>
<p>It was done by Tepco the biggest research center in energy production in Japan.<br>日本最大的能源生产研究中心东京电力公司完成了这些测试,</p>
<p>Maybe we can announce something that will come to you in talking about the water. A lot of you know the organization called the Emoto in Japan, with the water test<br>或许我们可以公布的东西会和大家谈论的水有关,许多人知道日本江本胜先生关于水的试验</p>
<p>02:59-02:60</p>
<p>And where they show the love on it and everything else; Keshe Foundation is in negotiating to develop of the process with the Emoto group.<br>试验显示爱及其它东西对水的影响和作用,凯史基金会正与江本胜团队协议关于这项水试验的发展问题</p>
<p>Mr. Harry Emoto, the son and thanks to the work of Sylvester, we have delivered and been study the final tests done this week we hopefully<br>江本胜哈利先生,江本胜先生的儿子,感谢西尔维斯特的工作,我们在本周交付了最后测试,凯史基金会希望通过宣布与江本胜</p>
<p>announce the cooperation and collaboration of the Keshe Foundation with the Emoto group in the development of these kinds of waters across the world.<br>团队的合作与协作能在世界范围内发展关于水领域的实验</p>
<p>We will bring and we are going into participation with the major players in the world of science.,We thanks to Sylvester.<br>我们将引进及参与进主流科学界的部份,感谢西尔维斯特</p>
<p>We delivered material I received the test this morning that in the lab just understand the potency on it .<br>今天上午收到实验室提供的测试材料才明白它的效力</p>
<p>and in the coming weeks a joint venture company called Keshe Foundation Emoto Group will be established in Japan for<br>未来几周凯史基金会江本胜集团联合投资公司将在日本成立</p>
<p>03:00-03:01</p>
<p>Delivery of this kind of materials for different diseases are radiation, you can use these waters for all kinds of influences, all kind of digestion of the heavy metals.<br>运送不同辐射类型的材料， 可用这些甘斯水净化所有重金属污染的情况</p>
<p>If you have people with the digestion of metals you can give them this water of the soap, and then you will see they reject the metal from the body.<br>如果你身边有人金属感染,你给他们甘斯水,此时可看到它们排斥金属并从体内排出来</p>
<p>Mercury can be rejected, but with mercury do not use CH3, with mercury use only CO2 ,no copper oxide .<br>水银也不可共存,但需使用CO2甘斯而不是CH3甘斯或者氧化铜</p>
<p>Yeah, so people who have like MS,a lot of MSS or a lot of mental diseases caused through mercury fillings. Now you give them co2 you find a lot of new neuro repairs,<br>是的,那么许多因水银而产生多发性硬化病及精神类疾病的症状,便可通过CO2甘斯作为新的治疗手段进行治疗</p>
<p>but do not use copper oxide because copper links up with mercury and with potassium in the body of the man.<br>但请注意,因铜会与人体内的水银及钾产生链接 请不要使用氧化铜甘斯</p>
<p>03:01-03:02</p>
<p>K: It can create a different condition it’s not the hazardous but something you don’t need. So you can clean metal toxicity ,toxicity from the body using the water of the Gans.<br>它能创造不同的环境 ，不会有害但可能是你不需要的东西,是的,我们可以用甘斯水化解人体内的金属毒</p>
<p>and if it’s not enough you just add a little bit more, try to use, once you make the culture the base,use the culture based<br>如果量不够只需添加一点,一旦你培养好底液后尝试一次</p>
<p>don’t used to use it use the water because it transferred the homogeneous energy to the water<br>但是不要象过去那样使用它,需要用上层水因它向水中传递了相同的能量</p>
<p>and now you made the soap mixture with different Gans, just use it as base you can use it for hundreds of years just put water on it and you collect the harvest the water , It has the same the effect .<br>用不同的甘斯做好混合肥皂这样可使用数百年,把它放在水里,这样便收集到了甘斯水,它具有同样效果</p>
<p>B: Yeah Mr. Keshe you mentioned a teaspoon or two is that means that the patient have to drink it<br>B: 是的,凯史先生,您提到病人需要喝一茶匙或两茶匙水是吗？</p>
<p>K: Yes, drink the water. Just the water because now you have made the Gans .Let mix it<br>K: 是的,只需喝上面的水,因为你已经制作好了甘斯,只需要把它们混合起来</p>
<p>03:02-03:03</p>
<p>Let it settle to the bottom and use the water and it works effectively I tell you how effectively it was .<br>静置沉底后使用上层水,这个非常有效.这是我告诉你的经验</p>
<p>I tell you when you shared so much beautiful knowledge just let me share you a little bit of knowledge for those in our review,<br>当你象我这样分享非常棒的经验分享更多知识时,这是非常美妙的事情</p>
<p>Then thank you on behalf we have shared we have we are running a trial on using the GANS on the GANS water for what we call supplements for eyes and the skin .<br>非常感谢你以我们的名义分享这些知识 ，我们正用甘斯进行试验 我们称应用在眼睛及皮肤上的甘斯水为营养补充液,</p>
<p>you are using coconut and cocoa cream .we are using olive oil as this for the same purpose .<br>你正在用椰子和可可奶油,我们用橄榄油,但它们的目的是一样的</p>
<p>For the eye drops we are on using a co2 water not the Gans of co2.<br>对于滴眼液,我们使用二氧化碳甘斯上层水而不是二氧化碳甘斯</p>
<p>I explain this you another first one to hear but I explained this yesterday with a teaching with the doctors. this well known around the people know me<br>我向对另一位第一个听到的这项技术的朋友解释过 ，在昨天对医生的教学上我解释了这点， 众所周知,作为我们这个年纪</p>
<p>03:03-03:04</p>
<p>I suffer from the generation of eye which means I was I’m losing my sight slowly in different dimensions, and I even switch I switch from a normal telephone watching the screens just to be able to read at least easier .<br>正承受因年岁大视力衰退的问题 ，我甚至把普通电话机换成带屏幕的电话机， 以便看得更清楚</p>
<p>Now that we have launched a Gans water for either I drop I started using the eyedropper water Gans in my eyes by Sunday.<br>现在我们推出了甘斯滴眼液产品， 这周日我用甘斯滴眼液滴在我的眼睛上</p>
<p>I spend this in the medical teaching yesterday and I cannot even read the fall I mean from the mobile phone. I have to concentrate not on my eyes<br>昨天的医学教学上我提到这个例子 ，我甚至没办法阅读手机上的电话本 ，需要集中视力才能看到</p>
<p>but that could see the pictures I change the bigger screen in past couple weeks to be able to see more<br>前两周我换了更大屏幕的手机 ，这样可以看图片和更多内容</p>
<p>and first tim I use eye drop in my eyes I had a strange headache strange sinking feeling in the back of my brain<br>第一次当我把甘斯液滴在眼睛后， 我的头很痛且大脑伴有紧张沉重的情绪</p>
<p>03:04-03:05</p>
<p>When I used it second time I had the tinkling on my tongue it was very strange for about hours but<br>第二次使用它时我感到舌头有点绕,这种奇怪的感觉持续了大概一个小时</p>
<p>against which in the first day since Monday, I can see how what I could not see before,<br>第二天也就是周一早上,我到办公室做演讲时能看到以前看不清的内容</p>
<p>this morning just become wrong I come on the presentation .I was with Caroline in my office,<br>当时凯若琳跟我在一起， 办公室桌子离我大概两米远</p>
<p>and the table is that the paper is about two meters away from me on the table I there, I said:” Caroline,look, I can read the numbers ,it is 16042016.”<br>一张纸放在桌上 我跟凯若琳说:”凯若琳,看,我可以读到纸上的数字是 160 4 2016 “</p>
<p>She said you can read from this distance now. I said i don’t know, I can see I am having new world. I feel the pressure in my eye has changed,<br>她说你现在可以在这个距离下看到这些内容,我说我不清楚我正看到新的世界,我感到眼部压力的改变</p>
<p>You know your eyes narrow is down and your facial pressure changes now I fell relaxation in my face because I don’t need to concentrate.<br>你知道自己的眼睛眼距变短且脸部压力改变,现在不用总是集中视力我感到脸部放松</p>
<p>Now ,I could not see at night, yesterday, I see totally new, different world<br>本来我晚上看不见 ，昨天开始,我看到全新的 ，完全不同的世界</p>
<p>03:05-03:06<br>so I’m testing the Gans water directly into my own eyes because I suffer badly is suffering that go to sleep at night had a lot of pressure in my eyes all the time<br>此前我的视力变得越来越糟糕,尤其是晚上休息时眼睛压力感一直很不舒服,那么,现在正用我的眼睛直接测试甘斯水</p>
<p>This morning i woke up with no pressure it was a pleasure to be young again<br>今天早上起床后明显感到压力减轻， 重返年轻的感觉真好</p>
<p>I can see, I was sitting in here if you’re coming to the auditorium, I was sitting on the second row , many time in past year<br>being here I sit on these chairs when you love teach<br>我可以看到,如果你来大礼堂看到我坐在这里,过去几年通常我会坐在第二排的椅子上， 当你喜欢上教学的时候通常会这样</p>
<p>and I tried to look I can’t read I know the book it says my books on the table now from here I can read the word what they are about five meters 10 meters away<br>我试着读我写的书,它们放在桌上,此前眼睛不能看清书上的字,现在我可以看清这些字 它们大概离我5至10米远</p>
<p>I can read the books now them and us in four days of just spraying some gas water of the co2 into my eye<br>只是用4天左右的时间滴了些甘斯水在眼睛上</p>
<p>03:06-03:07</p>
<p>Because if I deliver technology I have to be studying the test of the technology myself so I see the<br>difference .<br>因为如果我在教授技术， 那么我必须亲自验证技术测试结果,所以我有这些结果的不同比较</p>
<p>So you can try it try it safely that thousands of people with eye generation .It has worked on me .<br>现在你可以放心使用它,尤其对于数以千计有视力问题的几代人来说,这个产品对我有效</p>
<p>But as I said yesterday to the doctors I’m not interested in me seeing is better .What I’m interested in is why in changing the conditional of eye the tongue reacted.<br>但昨天我跟医生提到,对于视力的好转我并不感兴趣,而更感兴趣的是为什么改变眼部环境舌头发生了反应？</p>
<p>this is the strange point .what has the eyes got two new turner？ why my pain in the back of my head where there is a section in regarding the writing had the problem .<br>这很奇怪,眼睛通过滴眼液有什么改变？为什么后脑部会痛， 是不是写书写出问题的？</p>
<p>I’m left-handed i stopped writing because i can’t see properly .Now it means when you adjust eyes,<br>因为视力问题我停止了写作,现在是不是意味着当我们调整眼睛时</p>
<p>everything else in the body of the brain which adjusted itself for your disability which is coming up<br>大脑中的每一处显示不健康的部份都会随之调整</p>
<p>03:07-03:08</p>
<p>Now is correct itself too. You understand, look at the implementation and what this technology brings not just because you make the soap and clean.<br>现在它可以自我修复,通过修复的完成你能理解这个技术带来的不只是用于清洁的肥皂</p>
<p>it is not a orange juice or skin of olive oil which makes it tuner. The technology is a transfer of energy,<br>也不只是用橙汁或橄榄油护肤让它更???,这个技术是能量转换的技术</p>
<p>Use these soaps and see how we can take things of how do they affect this thing not only the bacteria’s .Do we transfer the energy do we need any water to wash anymore.<br>用这些甘斯肥皂看我们如何能影响环境而不只是细菌,我们转换能量时需要清洗任何水么</p>
<p>Or can we put the soap near it then transfer the energy from it. Do you understand,<br>或我们能把甘斯肥皂靠近它然后以此进行能量转换吗？,你明白吗？</p>
<p>this year this is what we have to extend the knowledge,we’re opening in your door and thanks very much to offices of always<br>这是今年我们所需扩展的知识,我们在打开你的意识之门,非常感谢一直以来提供办公场所</p>
<p>that I was telling yesterday for last 5 year to the people in the Italian nucleus and I was guest of them thanks to the offices of CIA<br>我昨天也提到在过去5年对意大利核物理界的感谢 对于他们来讲我是客人 同样也感谢CIA的工作人员</p>
<p>03:08-03:09</p>
<p>who brought us to Ghana we thank you for bringing us Ghana to be able to do free research on,development.<br>把我们带到加纳,感谢你们帮我们加强联合进行免费的研究及拓展</p>
<p>you it has both beautiful people like you with your knowledge with us .We work with everyone we have no boundaries and borders in sharing knowledge<br>这些朋友象你一样和我们一起工作,分享美妙的知识,我们与每个人一起工作,无界限及无条件分享知识</p>
<p>and thanks to people who are around the foundation knowing what we can do what we can see the beauty of Africa and the knowledge of the scientist .<br>感谢为基金会服务的人们,了解我们所做的以及我们看到美丽的非洲及这些科学家的知识</p>
<p>It would be nice to invite or to allow the other scientists to come to Ghana and space institute as Benjamin said a few minutes ago you have scientists from all over the world,<br>我们也非常欢迎其他科学家来到加纳,正如本杰明几分钟前所说,这些科学家是太空机构的基础组成成员,基金会的科学家来自全世界</p>
<p>We are there the Keshe foundation especially is your summit in August I have left the time and the place in the hand of Benjamin<br>我们一直在凯史基金会,尤其是8月份你们的高层会议期间,在我离开的时间里,本杰明一直在管理日常事务</p>
<p>03:09-03:10</p>
<p>we will be glad to have we have scientists all over Africa will work in different aspects of the Keshe foundation to be there.<br>很高兴来自全非洲的科学家将在凯史基金会进行各个领域的研究</p>
<p>It is time and I said this many times and as you know as I said I spend years in Africa is time that the scientists of Africa do not have to clean laboratories in America to pay to become doctors to be kept for their knowledge of economic.<br>正如大家知道的那样我在非洲提到了许多次 非洲的科学家是时候不用象在美国那样通过清理实验室去支付成为医生的学费</p>
<p>I have many friends doctors professors who did everything in u.s.<br>在美国纽约我有许多朋友， 如医生教授遍及各个领域</p>
<p>New York to become doctors and scientists and then they kept out of the nation to the assets of where they clean the toilets<br>为了成为医生和科学家他们离开国家并通过清洗厕所完成学业</p>
<p>with now it’s time for the Europeans come to Africa and learned knowledge from the birthplace<br>是时候让欧洲科学家们来非洲科学家们的出生地学习知识了</p>
<p>you have beautiful scientist I have a lot of respect for doctors and professors and scientists in Africa because<br>在非洲我得到了许多医生和科学家的尊敬</p>
<p>03:10-03:11</p>
<p>you spend time deliberately and a lot of resources of the families which they don’t have to become scientists where you sit here<br>因为你花时间在做教学,这里有许多家庭他们并不需要成为科学家 你和他们一起坐在那里听课</p>
<p>and is very different that somebody was giving the grant and everything on the table .You just go and read the book for give you a degree .<br>很不同的是他们同意且所有的事情都公开的在桌面上,你只是去听课看书然后获得学位</p>
<p>A lot of scientists thank you, a lot of scientists we see in Iran nuclear industry, in anatomical structures of the East Asia<br>许多科学家感谢你,因此我们可以在东亚架构上看到伊朗的核工业</p>
<p>You want to become where you are ,it wasn’t given to you on a silver spoon and for that you learned it through science and there is a lot of respect for you.<br>你想成为你想成为的人,这并不能给你一个银勺子,而是你通过学习科学获得许多尊敬</p>
<p>I work with a lot of you have very good friends in different African nations over 30 years 40 years<br>在过去30至40年 ，我跟非洲许多国家的科学家一起工作 并成为了好朋友</p>
<p>and this is time to change the position that the world come to Africa to learn from Africa how easy you can share knowledge on<br>这一次将转变位置， 世界将来到非洲学习这些共享出来的简单知识</p>
<p>Thank you very much for sharing knowledge with us today let us see what you bring us next week<br>非常感谢今天为我们做的知识分享 ，让我们看看下周你可以为我们带来什么</p>
<p>03:11-03:12</p>

<p>because it’s not just growing the food is looking after nursing the animals on the field as well<br>因此基金会会把兽医加入进来作为农业项目的一部份</p>
<p>03:36-03:37</p>
<p>so we try with Dr. Guitar to bring a new platform if you are a veterinarian if you’re involved with their health care of the animals to become part of the teaching as part of the agriculture and the veterinarian<br>所以如果你是一名兽医,我们将和你一起开辟新的平台,负责动物医疗,并把它成为农业教学的一部分</p>
<p>that because more or less you will learn what you use for your animal .You can use for your plants with the same benefit. So it’s a mature?replication of the science,<br>那麼或多或少你会知道用什么照顾动物,并用同样的知识运用在农作物上,这门科学已经相对成熟并且可以复制</p>
<p>anything else or shall we come end the day<br>还有其它问题吗？还是我们可以结束今天的课程？</p>
<p>Dr.Klaus:Mr Keshe, just the question because some veterinarians also applied for the medical teaching, shall we then I’ll switch let them switch to the agriculture teaching<br>Dr.K：凯史先生， 有一个问题 ，一些兽医也申请了医学教学 我们可以把他们并到两个教学中吗？</p>
<p>Keshe:Human body and animal body is the same ,you can go to both<br>K：人体和动物体是一样的， 可以的</p>
<p>Dr.Klauz: Okay<br>Dr.K ：好的</p>
<p>Keshe:Because we know Dr. Rodrigo treat dogs as good as women and men and hit and in general well with the tuber here<br>K：因为我们知道罗德里哥对待狗象待人一样好</p>
<p>03:37-03:38</p>
<p>Dr.K:Yes,and we just got in a picture from a dog which was injured in his eye came in touch with chemicals and after one week by using the liquid plasma Co2 in his eye, it was nearly gone so amazing<br>Dr.K：是的 我们从一张照片中看到一只狗因接触化学品受伤的眼睛， 用二氧化碳甘斯滴眼液一周后， 它眼睛上的化学物几乎没有了， 这真是很神奇</p>
<p>Keshe:Isn’t that strange enough is Doctors are human too and they get sick they get injured and it’s good to see if they can find a solution<br>K：是不是很神奇， 我们知道医生也是人， 当医生生病受伤， 他们能找到一个好的解决方案是很好的</p>
<p>In their world they will come to the plasma worlds and find the solution for it ,and as I said it is beautiful for me<br>在医生的世界,用医生对等离子体世界的理解并应用它 对我来说非常美妙</p>
<p>You it’s hard to explain and more or less,10 20 meters away from the table i can read the words on the book I wrote seven, eight years ago<br>你很难解释相距10-20米 我可以读我写的书 这是我在七 八年前写的</p>
<p>because i could not see,So to me it works<br>此前我一直看不到， 现在可以了.所以对我而言， 不管他们怎么说， 滴眼液行之有效</p>
<p>03:38-03:39</p>
<p>irrespective whatever they say ,the pressure has gone and life looks different it’s very beautiful ,<br>眼部的压力已经消失， 现在的生活看起来不太一样了， 非常的美丽</p>
