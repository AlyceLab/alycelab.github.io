<p>英语脚本：保尔<br>英语笔译：第一部分 阿若兰<br>第二部分 成都一步穿锣<br>第三部分 fsociety—诗语<br>第四部分 自在的心<br>第五部分 慕容寒星<br>第六部分 广安拈花一笑<br>译稿整理：梦中真人</p>
<p>第一部分笔译  阿若兰<br>Rick: Welcome everyone to the 115th knowledge seekers workshop. The keshe foundation space ship institute it’s May 25th 2016 and once again we find ourselves here gathered to listen to the teachings of the keshe foundations through Mr. Keshe who looks like he is ready to go according to our screen here. Mr. Keshe are you ready there today for some activities we have a small presentation from Steven Zeng with a new type of medial unit and I am not sure what you have lined up for today as usual I am sure many things will pop up. GO ahead.<br>瑞克：欢迎每个人来参加凯史基金会太空船学院2016年5月25日第115次知识寻求者教学。我们看到自己又相聚在这里来聆听凯史基金会的凯史先生的教学，他看上去今天在这里已准备好用这里的屏幕做一些展示，我们将展示史蒂文•珍几个新型的中间单元，我不确定你今天像以往那样上线没有，我肯定会出现很多意想不到的事。继续吧。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Ok good afternoon good day to you as usual where and whenever you listen to these teachings, as we have seen the teaching now has moved into a new phase of a space technology and in the coming time you will see the development of the space technology it is true since where in the space we travel with gravitational field forces that we don’t float and we don’t in a way become not being controlled by our own physical behaviour as we see travels in space today.<br>凯史：下午好，像往常一样祝你们日安！无论你们何时何地聆听这次教学。我们已经看到教学已经进入到一个太空技术的新阶段。在接下来时间里，你们会看到太空技术的发展，这是真实的，自从我们能够在太空中利用引力场强进行旅行，我们不漂浮，不像现在太空旅行要通过控制我们的物理行为。</p>
<p>As part of the program of the keshe foundation as we said the Rome event is moving up and we are setting ready for it and at the same time the motions program is behind the scene developing its own way and we see in the coming time  as people join in.<br>The number of announcements we have to  make which is usually do the most important one is that this announcements directs and is towards the china, Chinese people, Chinese keshe foundation and Chinese leadership. We make it very clear, the Chinese leadership has appointed professor Xu of USPC to be the direct connection between the keshe foundation and the government and military. From today we accept and respectively we appoint professor XU to be the representative and the head of the keshe foundation in China.<br>凯史：作为凯史基金会项目的一部分，如我们所说，罗马会议正在来临。我们为此做好了准备。同时，空间运动项目正在幕后进行，按照它自己的方式发展。我们看见在接下来时间里，人们会加入进来。<br>我们必须要做出许多声明，这是通常所做的，一个最为重要的声明是有关中国、中国人民、中国凯史基金会以及中国领导的。我们很清楚地表明，中国领导已经任命USTC的朱教授作为凯史基金会与政府以及军事部门之间的直接联络人。从今天起，我们承认并充满敬意地任命朱教授为中国凯史基金会的代表与领导。</p>
<p>As Chinese organisation laboratories and different organisations come to work together. There is a need to bring as we said sometimes ago the work of the keshe foundation in line and work in conjunction with the governments wishes of the nation. So we accept the appointment of professor Zhu as the head of the keshe foundation china and is compulsory to request an appointment of professor Zhu by the central government. All the Chinese groups in china all the 7, 8 labs plus the groups which are working in the background the development of the new gans with the funding which has been received for up to 2 ton a day we support and we approve and at the same time all the work of the keshe foundation in china from today is handed over to professor Zhu at as USTC and at the same time he is a professor in the university he become the head of the keshe foundation china.<br>凯史：中国团队的实验室、不同的团队将会在一起工作。正如我们以前常说的那样，凯史基金会有一个工作计划，将会跟有意愿的国家政府协同起来，所以我们接受朱教授为中国凯史基金会领导的任命，我们接受中国中央政府任命朱教授的请求。所有在中国的团队、所有的七八个实验室，加上在幕后工作的团队，在资金支持下新甘斯的开发已经达到日产2吨。我们支持、我们同时同意从今天开始中国凯史基金会的所有工作将会移交给USTC的朱教授，同时他是一所大学的教授，他成为中国凯史基金会的领导。</p>
<p>In due time as we merge the work of the laboratory and the keshe foundation in china with the work of the government and the need of the government the position becomes very apparent it will be very powerful positon where the science the technology and the wish of the governments of Keshe foundation and Chinese government will come together. This is important we will request  to respond today and we respond accordingly. On the other hand all development from now on and to my travel to china in next few weeks will be coordinated and is in hand of professor Zhu and professor Zhu will confirm everything to be done in china through its office he is professor as we said of USPC and professor Zhu, we will deliver all the works of the keshe foundation in china has to go through him no other channel,<br>凯史：在适当时候，我们将实验室、中国凯史基金会的工作与政府的工作及需求结合起来。凯史基金会的科学、技术跟政府的意愿走在一起来了，这种趋势变得很明显和强大的。这是很重要的。我们会请求今天给于回复，我们也会作相应的回复。在另一方面，从今天开始进行的所有发展以及在未来几周我去中国的旅行，将会被协调起来，并交由朱教授负责执行，朱教授通过他的办公室将确定中国做的一些事。他是教授，正如我们所说的是USTC的朱教授。我们将中国凯史基金会的所有工作都不得不交由他进行处理，没有其它的信息通道了。</p>
<p>we bring all the sites different laboratories work of the keshe foundation the commercialization and the development and especially the new funding for production of the 2 ton of gans material per day as is planned will be headed by him and I thank professor Zhu and accepting the position.<br>凯史：我们促进凯史基金会各地不同的实验室的工作进行商业化和开发，尤其是新的资金涌入去计划每天2吨甘斯材料的生产，这些都由朱教授来计划与领导。我感谢朱教授，并且接受这个情形。<br>On the other hand today as we talk tests are going in japan which will allows us hopefully next week or 2 to confirm the work and the delivery of the what we call material in japan for decontamination and every other application of the gans material into Japanese society on the back of the development of what we had with Techco<br>另外，今天我们谈到测试将会在日本进行时，有希望在下一个星期或者2个星期日本能确认我们相关的测试结果以及我们交付给日本的我们所说的用于日本的净化材料，在我们和达高公司所拥有的技术开发之后，其他每种甘斯材料会应用到日本社会，<br>now we bring it hopefully today with the next 2 3 days in collaboration with the with well know establishment in japan into the market where Japanese can be benefited by the same technology as techco has been. The important point for us is to carry on with the development we have taught a lot in the space technology we have taught, a lot in respect to the development of the reactors which can be used for the space.<br>现在，我们今天希望接下来两三天与日本政府合作，很清楚地知道日本公司推向市场，通过如达高公司同样的技术，日本人民将会从中受益。对我们来说重要的一点，是我们所教授的大量的太空技术的发展，我们已经教授了大量的用于太空的反应器的发展。<br>This is important to the team of professor Zhu in, that’s how his name is spelt.<br>这对于朱教授的团队很重要的事情。他的名字是这样拼写的 </p>
<p>He is a professor at USPC and appointed by the Chinese leadership to head us and his team 7, 8 team we are working is important for you to understand this very very carefully it is part of the development you are producing and our teaching goes directly to the Chinese infrastructure of the scientist who in the background of the keshe foundation. In the  reactors you are developing for space as you explained in the rotation of the systems where we taught you last week you can connect in a way that the rotation of the coil and the rotation of the core can produce interaction between the fields which creates a condition of the motion and lift. In this condition in space we do not have motors we do not see engines.<br>凯史：他是USTC的教授，由中国领导所任命他来领导我们的（中国凯史基金会工作）。他的团队七八个，我们与他们一起工作是很重要的。你要非常非常仔细地理解这个。这是你们生产发展的一部分，我们的教学直接的进入到在凯史基金会幕后从事基础研究的科学家中。你在发展用于太空的反应器中，正像我们解释的，在这个系统的旋转中 ，就是我上个星期解释的，你们可以在某种方式上连接这个线圈的旋转与核心的旋转 ，这样会在这些场之间产生一种互动，从而创造出运动与飞升的条件，在太空的条件下，我们没有看见马达，没有看见引擎。</p>
<p>第二部分笔译  成都一步穿锣<br>Here part of the advantage of working on earth knowledge and technology man has created himself motors we just use these motors as done. But in space how do we create motion how do we create motion of the plasma that in the interaction of the field plasma when the difference is large enough leads to friction or at the end leads to the physical motion and rotation.<br>工作在地球上的这部分的优势在于利用这些知识和技术,人类可以制造他们自己的发动机,我们只是使用这些发动机。但是在太空中，我们如何创建运动，我们如何创建在等离子体磁场之间的相互运动，不同之处在于足够大导致的摩擦力或者最终导致物理的运动和旋转。</p>
<p>We have a number of choices we can create plates where on these plates all you need to do you create ganses of different strength indifferent positions that field flow in the fields of different plate creates rotation of the what you like to be in the centre of your reactors. If you look at this in a top view.<br>我们有许多选择，我们可以创建盘子（能量单元-译者注），在这里你需要在不同的位置创建不同磁引力场强度的甘斯，不同盘子之间的磁场流动会在你的反应器中心创建你所喜欢的旋转，如果你从顶部去观察的话。</p>
<p>Our Chinese friends you are developing this please understand this very carefully this is the next step in control of plasmatic condition of field what we call condition of field what we call field plasma not liquid plasma or a vapour plasma. When you are developing there are states that develop this condition for developing system using the mass amount of gans you produce this is important to understand what kind of ganses you need to produce that the investment which is set for Oasis on space is used appropriately.<br>我们的中国朋友们正在发展这个，请明白这个需要非常小心，这是下一阶段关于控制等离子态磁引力场，我们所说的磁场条件，我们所说的等离子体场体不是液体等离子体或者气体等离子体。当你正在开发状态，开发这个系统的条件是大使用甘斯的集合，你生产这个弄清楚甘斯的种类是非常重要的，你需要投入生产因为那是适合太空的绿洲装置。</p>
<p>Producing mass amounts of gans without a clear direction from the beginning is exactly what you are not heading for. If you look at this, at 2 plates, this is the other plate, remember in the space technology you always feed from the strongest field strength of the lowest field strength, and if you can create a condition of the rotation of the field through the plasmatic what we call radiation of fields you achieve a constant flow and you achieve a constant dictating the condition and the speed of rotation of the plasma without physically moving anything in your reactor cores.<br>从一开始就没有明确什么是产生甘斯场流的正确的方向。如果你看这个，两个盘子，这是另外一个盘子，要记住在太空技术中总是从较强的磁场强度流入较弱的磁场强度，如果你能够通过等离子态创建一个旋转的状态，我们称之为场体旋转，你获得一个恒定的流动并且获得一个不间断的条件，并且在你的反应器中等离子场体的转速超出任何物理的运动。</p>
<p>Raising in different orders your very much like the patches you made of different material in different position will give you a lot of rotation without actually doing any physical motion of your plates. As the fields you can introduce or withdraw, try to feed you from let’s say the highest order strength to the lowest in trying to catch up they create a field flow. You don’t need motors; you don’t need engines.<br>调整不同的高度，很像你在不同的部位构成不同的材料，你的盘子将带给你许多实际上超过任何物理运动的旋转。你可以引进或者引出这些场体，试着供养你从，让我们这么说吧：从最高位的强度流向最低的，在尝试捕获过程中他们创建了一个磁场流。你不需要电动机；你不需要马达。</p>
<p>The whole purpose of the new what we call field plasma is to introduce and apply plasma technology without motors the way they universe works. So it is important in the upcoming work especially with the Chinese government the scientist work around us to understanding this that this is the space towards space technology without depending on motors which can fail, breakdowns and the failure of system.<br>新的整体目的我们称之为引入等离子场体和运用等离子技术，这是没有发动机的宇宙运行的方式。所以，它是非常重要的即将来临的工作，尤其是围绕着我们工作的中国政府的科学家理解这个，这是基于发动机助推器走向太空的航天技术必然会失败原因，是故障和系统的失败。</p>
<p>In space if you understand the interaction of the field you understand there is no need for motors there is no need for physical systems even physical reactors to contain the plasma can its motion. If you see, I have drawn a field in pink I have not drawn a core. In space you can dictate the parameters where the solid state stays and where is maintained.<br>在太空中如果你理解场体间的互动，理解这些互动根本不需要发动机，不需要任何物理的系统甚至不需要物理的反应器来控制等离子体的运动。如果你看，我用粉色画一个场域，我没有画一个核心。在太空中你可以命令保留固态的边界，其边界就会被维持。</p>
<p>Look at the structure of the surface of this planet. It’s the interaction of the field which decide where you have the solid state matter of the continents and where the liquid state of the oceans stays. In the same time the interaction of the fields in the inner sanctum of the planets and in interaction with the field with the plasma of the solar system is size the thickness of what we call the atmosphere of this world.<br>观察这个星球表面的结构。这是由场体的互动所决定的，在那里有大陆的固态物质也有液态的海洋。同时与行星内核的场体以及太阳系尺度的等离子场混合互动而形成我们所说的这个世界的大气层。</p>
<p>There is no mechanism to hold the oxygen or the hydrogen or the gases except by the interaction of the field. So going into the field plasma technology this is the next step which is containment by field and not by matter condition, As man is materialistic and is connected to the matter state we went through the whole stage from molecular structure to atomic plasmatic now we enter the field of the technology the same as in the universe If you look at the structure of the galaxies you see they all have different shapes and forms and we see the boundaries of it , these shape and forms are only created by the in interaction of the field of the stars and the systems within the galaxies and the interaction with the fields and what is in the environment of the universe around them, dictate the shape dictate the colour dictate the flatness and now you see the shape of a galaxy without a containment and this is where the field plasma technology goes.<br>在这里除了场体的互动以外没有机械的装置来维系氧或氢或者其它气体的存在。所以加入到等离子场技术，这是下一阶段的技术包含场体而没有任何物质的条件，人类是唯物的与物质状态发生连接，我们经历了从化学分子结构到原子粒子结构整个阶段，现在，我们进入到与宇宙一致的场的技术。如果你观察星系的结构你会看见它们都有不同的形状和运行方式，我们看见它的边界和范围，这些形状和运行方式仅仅由这些星体的磁引力场之间的互动所创造，这些星系内的系统和场域之间的互动，宇宙的环境环绕着它们，决定了它们的形状，决定了它们的颜色，决定了它们的平面尺度。现在你看见星系的形状而没有控制，这就是等离子场体技术要去到的领域。</p>
<p>In space you cannot go and look for copper to make a core. But you can create a condition from interaction of a field that gives you the confinement of the plasma within the atmosphere of your system without actually ever having a physical matter structure. This way in the space you never look for materials to create things, you look for the interaction for the fields to maintain develop and to operate and use different field in given condition for the development and for the structure of your systems.<br>在太空中你不能找到铜去制造线圈，但是你可以从一个场体创建一种状态，那会为你创建一个等离子大气层的范围，在你的这个系统的范围之内，使你事实上永远保持一个物质的身体结构。这种方式在太空中你绝不会去寻找材料来制造任何东西，你寻找场的互动来维持生长和运转，利用不同的场来控制和发展你的系统的结构。</p>
<p>If you understand this you will understand the reason why as I explained before at the moment you are producing copper cores, you are producing crystal cores, what happens when you enter and the space somewhere in the galaxy somewhere in the universe where the copper state of the matter is the field plasma strength of the environment, you lose your reactor. You lose your life you lose your space ship because now the plasma cannot be contained its very much if you understand it you have an ice in the freezer you bring it in the heat of the summer and it melts it has not shape it changes its behaviour in space in different gravitational magnetic fields you understand that matter state which you up to now have followed becomes troublesome, because one second you have a core next second you don’t have a core because your core strength matter state has happened to mix and be the same as its environment. This is what goes back in the understanding of the containment of the skin of the man.<br>如果你理解了这个，你就会明白为什么我之前解释的，此刻你制造铜核心，你制造水晶核心，发生什么？当你进入银河系的某处，宇宙的某个地方，在那里，铜的物质状态将表现为环境中等离子体磁场的强度，你失去了你的反应器，你失去了你的生命，你失去了你的太空飞船，因为现在等离子体是非常的，不能被控制的。如果你明白，就像你有一块冰淇淋在冰箱里面，你把它带到夏天炎热的地方它就会融化，它失去了它的形状，它改变了它的习性。在太空中，在不同的重力磁场中，你要明白现在物质状态会变成一种麻烦，因为前一秒钟你还有一个核心，下一秒钟就没有了，因为你的物质状态的核心磁场强度碰巧与环境中与它一样强度的磁场发生了混合。这就回到头来理解为什么人类的皮肤限制和维持了人类的形象。</p>
<p>You create interaction of the field plasmas where the layers of plasma gives the manifesting of the physicality but because you have used different strength field strength as this dynamic state as the fields changes the field strength rotation changes you maintain your skin. We go in the water we don’t melt; we go in the heat of the summer we don’t melt because our body has accepted a field transfer of a limitation of environmental magnetic gravitational field variation. So in space you have to have the same condition where your reactor stays and the minimum condition of the assistance of the man which is your amino acid and operates and maintains a shell of field and not matter state to create a condition and maintaining the position in the respect to the core system which is create itself. So what you need and what you come to understand is you use a spectrum of plasmatic gravitational field which the interaction in the positons you have predetermined dictates the speed of the rotation the field strength and at the same time the positioning of the field in respect to its environment.<br>你制造等离子体磁场的互动，在那里等离子层使你显现为物质的肉体，是因为你习惯不同的磁场强度随着磁场强度动态的变化，旋转的变化，你维持你的皮肤。我们进入水中不会融化，我们来到炎热的夏天也不会融化，因为我们的身体可以适应地球磁场环境的场体变化。所以，在太空中你必须有相同的条件，那是你的反应器和帮助人类能够存在的最低条件。那是你的氨基酸运转和维持一个磁场的壳的必要条件，没有物质去创建一个状态来维持一个核心系统的相对位置，它就是创造本身。所以什么是你的需要，你需要明白的是你使用一个等离子态的重力场频谱范围，那是电子的互动决定了磁场的强度和旋转速度,同时涉及到在环境中的磁场定位。</p>
<p>Field plasma is the ultimate step in space technology and our Chinese friends are achieving and targeting in that direction with the help of the government and we are there support and bring other nations in line with where the Chinese are heading. It is important to realise as you play with different gears in the gears in a mechanical system in a motor system in a space technology you play with field strength of different dimension that it allows you to create a condition of rotational positioning an even physical interaction to create a physical condition to maintain and contain matter state. If you understand the step, then very simply now that you produced the liquid gans liquid plasma now it should be very easy to manipulate the liquid plasma to produce field plasma.<br>等离子磁引力场是太空技术的终极阶段，我们的中国朋友在政府的帮助下把实现这个目标作为方向，我们在这里支持和促使其他国家也加入进来，中国将起到领头作用。认识到这点非常重要，如同你们在发动机机械系统里面把一个一个不同的齿轮连接起来，在太空技术中，你们玩不同维度的磁引力场强度，它允许你们创建旋转定位的条件，甚至物理的相互作用去创造物理的身体去维持和控制物质状态。如果你理解了这一步，那么非常简单，现在你生产液体甘斯，液体等离子体，现在应该非常容易操作液体等离子体产生等离子场。</p>
<p>You can direct you can target you can control the speed of it by the mound of it you have to understand it works by the mass gradational magnetic plasmatic mass which decides now by the volume now we have to start becoming masters of how to mix different gans different plasmatic liquid ganses to create the strength which you need and how you can withdraw and add to, this I start speaking about in past couple of weeks.<br>你可以编辑，你可以设定，你可用反应堆来控制它的速度，你必须明白它是靠等离子磁场强度的梯度的集合来工作的，那是由这个集合决定的。现在在这个量方面，现在我们开始成为如何混合不同的甘斯，不同的等离子态液体甘斯去创建磁引力场强度的大师，你可以根据你的需要去减少或者增加。在过去几周我开始谈论这个。</p>
<p>Some of you understood, government scientist have jumped on it they are running like crazy because they receive the key into universal motion and the understand it. What it means if you remember we went through it like we looked at mercury we looked at lead we looked at the atomic mass of gold and silver you cannot mix these materials in a physical matter state its impossibility but you can create a gans of them as then create a plasmatic field liquid plasma of them and then you have a freedom to play the game of the universe through a field which is released by plasmatic liquid. Maybe now you understand why I brought you in this path that you slowly understand the work of the universe. It was hard to produce the plasmatic field from a matter state, we nano coated it we separated it, made the gans of it in the gans we brought it to the liquid state now we understand the final play, we play with the field, in this state of alloys there are certain materials who never mix you cannot mix mercury with coper and lead and gold. You cannot do with the other materials but if you make nano material of it make the gans of it make the link without it in the liquid plasma you have the field of it and the interaction of the fields gives you everything you could imagine to create. This is the writing of Mahammad bless his name when the man understands the limitation of the elements.<br>你们中的一些人懂得，政府的科学家跳上去疯狂地去运行它，因为他们接受了进入宇宙运行的钥匙。这意味着什么？如果你们还记得，我们经历了就像我们关注水银，我们关注铅，我们关注金银的原子量，你不能在物理的物质状态下去混合这些材料，这是不可能的，但是你可以制造这些物质的甘斯，制造它们的等离子态的液体等离子场，然后你可以获得去玩这个宇宙游戏的自由，通过等离子态的液体的磁引力场。也许现在你明白了，我为什么把你们带上这条道路使你们慢慢明白宇宙的工作方式。从物质状态产生等离子场是很难的，我们把它纳米涂层，我们打开它们的原子结构，我们制造甘斯，我们把它带到液体状态，现在我们明白最终的游戏，我们玩场体，在合金的状态下，我们确信材料绝不能混合，你不能混合水银在铜里，在铅里，在金里。你也不能混合其他材料，但是如果你制造它们的纳米材料，制造它们的甘斯，制造它们在液体等离子状态下的连接，你获得它们的场体，场体之间的互动给你创造任何事情的可能性。你可以用你的想象去创造，这是默罕默德的记述，称颂他的名。当人类明白了基本元素的局限性。</p>
<p>And now you understand can the man achieve the maturing of his intellect now you see how we have come because now you can do exactly the same in reverse. Now that you have a plasmatic field you can go down to now the cycle is complete. You can create field winds you can create hurricanes without moving your finger. You can create waves that’s it sounds loud and sweetness and you can create oceans of winds in the condition of travelling across the universe at the speed of the universe itself that the point where there is no time this is more or less the ultimate position of science of universe its for you to start how to manipulate how to complete.<br>现在你理解人类可以实现，使他们的智力成熟，现在你看见我们如何做，因为你也可以做同样的事情。现在你有等离子场体，你可以继续下去，现在这个循环已经完成。你可以制造磁场的风，你可以通过移动你的手指制造飓风。你可以制造响亮的声波和芳香，你可以在你个人的兴趣条件下制造许许多多的风在宇宙自己的速度下穿越整个宇宙，在那里没有时间，或多或少，这是为你们开始如何去操作如何去完成宇宙科学的终极位置。</p>
<p>I have taught in past 2 years step by step as you understood more and more and more and now the plasma technology in this field plasma transfer is more or less the ultimate there is couple of more steps after the field plasma but the knowledge of man will take millions of years to understand it’s beyond the intelligence of the man. But this gives you sufficient enough knowledge to be able to create systems materials not only to enter the universe, enter the universal community but to give man every opportunity to create whatever he need no this planet that it stops the cause of war conflicts and the superiority of one man and the other cause every single mans can produce whatever h needs when he need it he does not become slave to the hand of the physical of his existence.<br>过去两年我一步一步地教导你们明白更多的、更多的、更多的，到现在的等离子体技术，等离子场体转变到或多或少最终的原则，等离子场连接以后更多的阶段，但是这个知识需要人类拿上百万年去理解，它超出了人类的理解力。但是这给与你足够充分的知识使你能够去创造系统材料而不仅是进入宇宙，进入宇宙社区，但是给与人类每一个机会去创造任何所需，使这个星球停止战争冲突的原因，以及，停止某个人的优越感或者每个个人可能发生冲突的其他任何原因，当他有需求的时候不需要用他实体的物理的手成为奴隶去拼命地获取。</p>
<p>If you understand the process if you understand the gravity for the knowledge which is releases today, you will understand you have reached apoint that man can fly can be at any point in the universe as he wishes and there is no need for colours races and nations because now your problem is not becoming froma village to a nation and to a planet now you have billions of planetariums which are part of universal community and they all have and carry this knowledge.<br>如果你理解这个过程，如果你理解今天释放的知识的重要性，你将明白你已经来到这个点上，人类可以飞翔，可以到达他所希望去到的宇宙中任何地点，不分肤色，种族，国家，因为现在你的问题不是从一个村庄到一个国家再到行星，现在有数以亿计的天文数字的一部分的宇宙社区，他们都拥有和运用这个知识。<br>Man has been left behind because of his own ignorance and his violence behaviour. Its completed. This way you create motion within the plasma within the fields of the plasma that you can decide the speed of the interaction and then even on the disc of the fields as you see in different colours you can predetermine this is the foundation of the field I want to be outside and I want to be inside as in so many way if you understand it’s very easy to create plasmatic conditions of layering in sequences that for example if you make another setup here and you make all of this lets say of copper strength in this state of planet your reactor will have a copper strength but cause its plasmatic it can change itself to another according to the pressure of the environment you never lose your containment of the fields.<br>人类被留下是因为他们的无知和暴力习性。这已经成为过去。用这个方法，你在等离子体、等离子场体里面制造运动，你可以决定这个互动的速度，然后甚至在磁场盘子上，就像你看见不同的颜色，你可以预先确定，这是磁引力场的基础，我想要留在这个外面或者进入到里面，如果你明白，有如此多的方法，它非常容易制造等离子状态的有序的分层条件，比如，如果你制造了其他结构，你制造所有这个，让我这么说吧，铜的强度在这个星体结构里面，你的反应器将拥有铜的强度，但原因是，等离子态可以改变自己到另外的强度，这取决于环境的压力，你绝不会失去你的磁引力场包裹。</p>
<p>You see solid state in matters of the universe on the planets made of whatever materials which is no available this is how it’s done. This is how now with man having the versatility of the use of the plasmatic field that he can dominate interact develop and create conditions that he works in a safe environment, scale this knowledge up, scale this knowledge down. The scale it up you can travel the universe in no time the scale it down you can create in the outer ring you can create the shape of the kidney of the man which has failed in operation you dictate the parameter around the kidney with your system outside the body and then you create field forces inside that arouse work of the kidney since it matters you do not need to remover the kidney of the man or look for somebody who is desperate for money to sell his kidney somewhere in slum.<br>你看见的固体形态与宇宙在这个行星上创造的诸如此类的材料有关，那不适用，这是已经完成的。这就是现在人们广泛地使用等离子态的场，那样他可以支配和影响进化并创造条件，那样他可以工作在安全的环境中，使这个知识向上扩展，使这个知识向下扩展。向上扩展，你可以在没有时间的宇宙中旅行，向下扩展，你可以创造外部的环状物（指磁力圈），你可以创造人类的肾脏，如果谁的肾脏运行失效的话，你可以规定参数，用你的系统在身体之外围绕肾脏编辑参数，然后你在内部创造场力激活肾脏工作，在这个事件中，你不需要取出人类的肾脏或者寻找那些在贫民窟里为了钱渴望出卖肾脏的人。</p>
<p>You can dictate where you want to grow in the hear where a child is born with hoe in heart without losing the child you can do the same if you understand this process how to use field forces to do remote no touch surgeries, scale it further up you can produce the fruits the shape and the colour of the banana you like. Now the mutation is in the hand of the intelligence of the man and how you used it and how you apply it how you bring it together in a way that does not harm you and does not change the condition to harm others in the environment which you exist. By creating plasmatic gravitational magnetic field tolerances, you accept a certain condition within that tolerance with the field strength matter condition.<br>你可以去听一个孩子出生前长大时心脏跳动的声音并想不要失去孩子，同样地，如果你明白这个方法，如何利用场体远程来做没有接触没有手术，更进一步扩展它，你可以根据你的喜好来制造香蕉的形状和颜色。现在这个人类智力的突变已经在你们手中，你们如何使用它，如何应用它，如何促进它共同走上一条不伤害你，不改变环境去伤害这个宇宙中其他存有的道路。依靠制造等离子体磁引力场的容差，使你适应特定环境下磁场强度的物质条件。<br> Now you can see who field plasma can lead to production of matter state as you wish the way you want and the creation the condition what while the system is working as our Chinese friends are heading to production, mass production of the oyster systems. The field plasmas they choose they dictate if within the containment energy fields of water is create, energy fields of food is created without actually passages or the people which are using the oyster system ever think of having drinking or have bring a need for food as it becomes part of the structure of the body and they absorb from the environment of the what I call oysters what they need.<br>现在你可以看见等离子体场可以导致物质状态的产品，你希望用你想要的方法去制造这些产品，什么时候这个系统都在工作就像我们的中国朋友正在生产的，大规模的生产牡蛎系统。如果控制水的能量场他们就可以选择、决定等离子体磁场创造，没有事实上的通路创造食物的能量场，或者人们使用牡蛎系统永远只想到去拥有饮料或者带来所需要的食物，就像它变成身体结构的一部分，他们总是想要从环境中去吸收什么，我称之为他们需要牡蛎。</p>
<p>In a really all you need to do you create a base at the bottom and a base at the top and itself in transfer of the plasma creates its own field condition and as your body is set in the structure of the gans state you can travel through and in and out and the matter state you decide what the barrier should be according to the field strength you use. You want it to be in the gaseous state resistance as on the surface of the earth or you want to be in the liquid state in the bottom of the ocean. You want to travel in deepest part of the universe which there no field but you dictate you can operate indoors loose weak field points or you want to go into the centre of the star and exist and have expression on how it will be.<br>事实上所有你需要去做的就是在底部去创建一个基础和一个基础在顶部，它本身传递等离子体创建自己的磁场条件，就像你的身体是甘斯状态的结构，你可以经历和出入物质状态，你决定界限应该是什么取决于你使用的磁场强度。你想要存在于有阻力的气体状态就像在地球的表面，或者你想要存在于海洋底部的液体状态。你想要旅行在宇宙最深的部分在那里没有磁场，但是你决定你可以在室内运转松散的弱场点，或者你想要去进入到恒星的中心去生存去表现如何去成为。</p>
<p>Now the knowledge is getting into the complete it’s you who have to understand how to manipulate the field forces of the plasmas the ganses and then the liquid plasma which you have created you need to move into the liquid plasma that you can move into the field plasma. It’s a condition which needs understanding and it takes very little, very short time for those who understood the process of the plasmatic gravitational field strength of the plasmas they have created to move on into the next step. As I said many times in the past few weeks the speed of teaching goes so fast that there is no time. And each one of you will take from the table of knowledge according to your intelligence and the point you cannot understand you oppose it and this is the behaviour of the man, or when you understand the lid of it you claim to be the whole of it you see this in many people who come around the foundation but our knowledge I free you can claim whatever you like as the knowledge was dispersed through this foundation and it’s the foundation of humanity so according to your willingness and strength to come clean and whatever you like but as long as you work which bring to mankind that the object of the foundation. Any questions?<br>现在这个知识进入完成阶段，是你们明白如何操作甘斯的等离子体磁层，然后液体的等离子体，你已经创建，你需要进入到液体等离子体那样你可以进入到等离子场。它是一个状态，你需要明白，它需要很少，很短的时间那些已经理解这个等离子体的磁引力场强度进程的他们将创建运动进入到下一个阶段。正如我多次说的通过在过去几周的教学以如此快的速度完成，我们已经没有多少时间了。根据你们每一个人的智力从桌上获取知识，在这一点上你不能理解你抗拒它，这是人类的习惯，或者当你明白你掩盖它，你自称已经掌握它，你看见许多人他们围绕着基金会，但是我们的知识是免费的，你可以要求任何你喜欢的，这个知识是通过基金会传播的，是全人类的基金会，所以取决于你的自愿和力量来传播不管你喜欢什么，只要你和基金会一样给人类带来和平，这是基金会的工作。有任何问题吗？</p>
<p>Rick: Thank you Mr. Keshe, check in various places here we have a few hands up any panellist that have any question you might want to open your microphone and go head or if you are a viewer you can put your hand up and I can promote you. And I will check on the live stream as well.<br>瑞克:谢谢你,凯史先生,有几个窗口有一些人举手，讨论小组有任何问题，你可以打开你的麦克风提问，如果你是观众，你可以举手，我可以帮你提交你的问题。同样我将在直播上核实。</p>
<p>Aria: Hello I am Aria from Germany, I have a question what is exactly the difference between the liquid plasma fields and the if you combine 2 different ganses is that if you combine 2 difference ganses that you have, you still have the separate fields that if you use the liquid plasma and water then it combines field as you explained before like new kind of material that doesn’t exist in the matter state or what exactly is the difference in field strength.<br>阿瑞亚：我是来自德国的阿瑞亚，我有一个问题，什么是不同的液体等离子场体之间的恰当的配置，如果你混合两种不同的甘斯，如果你混合两种有差异的甘斯， 你仍然有独立的场体，如果你使用液体等离子体和水，然后将他们混合在一起，就像你之前解释的，像一种不是存在于物质状态的新的材料，或者什么是正确的磁场强度的差异。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: You explained it very nicely in your last sentence. If you look at the gans state when you mix ganses they still stay gravitational magnetical field position in respect to each other. When you because they carry difference structure when you have we shown this clearly in book number 2 in where we show the ganses, I try to go to one side, where we have room, where we have the gans of for an example copper or you have to gans of another material even though they are in containment in a box in a glass if you look at them they are still position in respect to each other because the central position the central gravitational magnetic field is different. When you go into the liquid plasma now you have the same in origin so the gapping the distancing is constant all you have done you have created a condition of overloading the same plasma with difference strength with this radiate equal according to the mass into the environment which is released. This is homogenously as the plasma you created in gans state you have positioning in ta liquid you don’t but you have the field strength which is this this is what you are looking for. At each field interaction with its owns o it’sthe freedom whichyou do not have so here you create spectrum introduction, here you do not, you work on a very much same level but within the structure of the same atomic mass.<br>凯史先生：你最后一句非常恰当地解释了它。如果你着眼于甘斯状态，当你混合甘斯，它们仍然保留与其他场体之间的磁引力场定位。当你因为它们携带差异化的结构，当你看我们在第二本书里清晰地展示了的，在那里我们展示了甘斯，我尝试走到一边，我们有一间房间在那里，在那里我们有一个铜甘斯的样品，或者你有其他材料制造的甘斯，即使他们被限制在一个玻璃盒子里面，如果你看它们，它们仍然保持之间的相对位置，因为它们中心位置的磁引力场是不同的。当你进入到液体等离子体里面，现在你的原点是一样的，所有原点之间相互的距离是恒定不变的，你做了，你创建了一个负载，同样的在不同的等离子磁场强度这种辐射的条件下平等的调和释放到整体的环境之中。这是均匀的，就像你创建的甘斯状态的等离子体，在液体里你有一个定位，不但是磁场强度，这就是你们看见的为什么会有这样的效果。在磁场之间有它们自己的相互作用，它不是自由状态的，因此，在这里你创建了吸收光谱，这里你不能，你工作在一个原子量的结构非常相近的水平上。<br>Aria: Thank you that makes it clear to me<br>阿瑞亚：谢谢您，对我来说这很清楚了。<br>Mr. Keshe: Thank you very much. (mumbles). Ok that’s better thank you very much. Any other question.<br>凯史先生：非常感谢。（喃喃自语）。好的，那样很好，非常感谢你。有其它问题吗？<br>Rick: There is a question from Jerry. Will China produce different types of ganses and research into uses of other ganses also?<br>瑞克：这里有一个来自杰瑞的问题。中国将要生产不同类型的甘斯并且研究其他甘斯的应用吗？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Yes, in China they are fully committed to the full production of all the aspects of the keshefoundation technology the commitment by the organisation by the government and by the universities, we are built and will be built as part and by the universities a we are built and we will build as part of the structure of the university facing and all the scientific developments.<br>凯史先生：是的，在中国，他们完全地决心从事全面成批生产凯史基金会所有方面的科技产品，这是社会团体、政府、大学承诺，我们构建和将要建设部分大学，我们构建和将要建设大学的结构和所有的科学发展。<br>Chinese government has committed itself to peace and the peace as come through new technology and the knowledgeas we respect that and they have financially positioned themselves to support different development and appointed leading scientist in the country to take and collaborate to bring technology to its highest level and today we announce directly one of the top scientist in the country one of the top universities in the country and if you look President Xi was in this university 2 3 weeks ago. We announce the establishment of different sections of the keshe foundation university structure in thro ding weeks it’s got to be done by the governments and not by the keshe foundation.<br>中国政府承诺自己维护和平，以及带来和平的新的技术和知识，我们尊重这个承诺。他们用自己的财政金融来支持不同的发展，指定他们国家的科学家来领导和合作、促进这个技术到最高水平，今天，我们直接宣布他们国家顶尖的科学家和顶尖的大学之一 ，如果你看见许董事长2、3周之前在这个大学里。我们宣布接下来几周建立不同的凯史基金会大学的组织结构，这将是由政府而不是凯史基金会来组建。</p>
<p>That’s what we said the collaboration of the keshe foundation and governments has stared in very rapid way we have seen it in Ghana with the atomic commission you see as I was talking to Almin this morning united states government is moving to same path as we understand now that the Chinese are good. And we see the same thing in collaboration with Russia. AS I explained to you the technology is credibility understood by the leading scientist and its taking its own shape. China will lead the space technology the space ship program, China will lead through production of new energy system and china will lead in production of food and peaceful application of technology in the coil day but you work very closely you have appointed people appointed by them with just and reputably we work through the same IN so many way as I said before we thank president Xi  for his what I call clear decision making in bringing humanity to peace and taking the leadership in taking the technology in peaceful application.<br>那就是为什么我们说政府已经以非常快的方式关注与凯史基金会合作，我们也理解加纳原子能委员会，你瞧，就像今天早上我与阿尔明谈到的，美国政府已经走上相同的道路，我们明白现在中国人是好榜样。同样的我们也看到与俄罗斯的合作。正如我向你们解释的，主要的领导们和科学家们明白这个科技是真实的，它有它自己的形式。中国将领导这个和平的科学技术太空飞船项目，中国将领导生产新的能源系统，中国将领导生产美好的充满和平的技术的线圈，但是你必须紧密地工作，你需要指定卓越的人选给他们任命，我们通过同样地方式工作，在很多方面就像之前我说的，我们感谢许董事长，为他的能够给人类带来和平的清醒的决定，以及取得领导人理解和支持这个充满和平的科学技术的应用。<br>Rick: Mr. Keshe, you want me to show there is Chinese medical unit and they have a question about the copper versus the aluminium wire used in it.<br>瑞克：凯史先生，你想要我展示吗？这是中国的医疗单元，他们有一个关于铜和铝线圈的应用的问题。<br>Mr. Keshe: Yes, why not? Are they online they can explain it themselves?<br>凯史先生：是的，为什么不呢？他们在线，他们可以自己解释一下么？<br>Rick: I will ask Steven Zeng would like to speak about it and he declined I think he is a bitshy so he wanted to presented it said pretty.<br>瑞克：我问史蒂文.曾，他是否有什么要说的，他拒绝了，我想他可能太忙了，他想要完美地陈述它。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Let me explain something before you go when we arrive in china in the coming day the teaching of the keshe foundation will be directly targeted at the keshe foundation supporters and the scientist who understand and work around the foundation. 1000s of them so all the taking will be translated simultaneously in Chinese we start teaching live in Sichuan university  we shouldn’t be released in the west so teaching while in china is targeted for the scientist if you are a Chinese you are too shy to speak English or you think you understand when we are in china everything will be in Chinese the development the live teachings will be all in Chinese  translated in Chinese it will be done  for the Chinese nationals so this problem of language will be taken away this is a process which is set up by professor Xu that other keshe foundation supports everything will be totally in Chinese, so the collaboration will be very fine we don’t have the language barrier I cannot learn Chinese but we can teach very rapidly what we can in the time we stay in china we intend to say in china for 6 month at least maybe 6 to a year to develop fully all aspects withChinese government. Carry on.<br>凯史先生：让我来解释一些事情，在你走之前，当我们接下来抵达中国的时候，凯史基金会的教学的直接的目标是使得凯史基金会的支持者和科学家围绕凯史基金会来工作。在中国他们争取到一千人同时翻译，我们首先进驻四川大学进行教学，我们不会放弃西方的教学，所以虽然在中国的教学针对他们的科学家，如果你是一个中国人，对说英语感到害羞，或者你想想就会明白，当我们在中国，每件事情都用汉语来实况转播我们的教学，把它翻译成汉语是很累的，为了中华民族，这个语言的问题必须解决掉，这是一个过程，希望许董事长和其他凯史基金会的支持者建立翻译机制以使每件事情都完全是汉语的，所以，合作是极其细致的，我们不能有语言障碍。我不能学习汉语，但是我们可以非常快速地教学，在我们中国停留期间，我们打算在中国至少停留6个月，也许一年，与中国政府去在所有方面充分地发展。请继续。</p>
<p>Rick: Ok let me do a screen share when I get this set up, second here. And there we go, can you see that? Yeah can you open it up. Okay will try to makeit bigger.<br>瑞克：好的，让我分享屏幕，当我建立这个设置，这里第二个。好了，你能看见吗？是的，你打开它。好了，我们将取得更大的成功。<br>Mr. Keshe: There are 2 parts 6 crosses.<br>凯史先生：这是两个部分6个交叉。<br>Rick: Just a second here there we go. That’s a bit too big I have to take it a bit smaller. Almost there, there we go.<br>瑞克：只是第二个我们做好了。那个有一点太大了，我去拿个小一点的。差不多了，好了。<br>Mr. Keshe: Okay yeah it says introduction. There are 2 parts and 6 cross shaped spring units per part what does this mean.<br>凯史先生：很好，介绍一下它。这里有2个部分和6个十字形的弹簧单元，每个部分是什么意思。<br>Rick: So this is one part here with the 6 units and this part over here with 6 units so in part one he mentions the inner circles that would be the gravitational one ware nano coated copper<br>瑞克：这是6个单元的一部分，这一部分在6个单元之上，在第一个部分里面，他提到在内圈将会是引力的一个纳米铜制品。<br>Mr. Keshe: and the other one is copper outside aluminiumin side,<br>凯史先生：其他的是铜在铝的外边，<br>Rick:Yes exactly.<br>瑞克：是这样的。<br>Mr. Keshe: ok go further up, the spring unit is connecting with 2 plasma batter capacitors<br>凯史先生：好，下一步，弹簧单元与两个等离子电池电容连接。<br>Rick: Yeah each cross spring units is connectedin the 2 plasma battery capacitors.<br>瑞克：是的，每个交叉的弹簧单元与2个等离子电池电容相连接。<br>Mr. Keshe: (mumbles) so we see that, what is the next?<br>凯史先生：（喃喃自语）所以我们看那个，下一个是什么？<br>Rick: It says all the springs ware covered with CO2 gans, all the springs in the hat use nano, nano zinc9 I think wire coated with CO2 gans<br>瑞克：它说所有的弹簧制品都用CO2甘斯涂层了，所有的弹簧都纳米涂层了，纳米锌，我想金属丝都涂了CO2甘斯。<br>Mr. Keshe: They were saying for the helmet they use copper and aluminium for the body parts yeah,<br>凯史先生：他们说他们为这个头盔，他们用铜和铝来治疗身体部分，<br>Rick: so we test the combination we say eh magnetic flow of the device that the nano copper wire so we don’t use the wire to connect the wire to connect the 2 parts so the questions comes in, combination of nano copper wire zinc wire and aluminium wire is proper and is it necessary to use the nano wire to connect the 2 parts.<br>瑞克：我们测试这个组合，我们说，呃，这个装置的磁流那个是纳米铜线，所以我们不能用金属丝去接通这两个部分，它带来的问题是，纳米铜线锌线和铝线完全的组合，必须要用纳米线连接2个部分。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: It is not necessary but it is essential. It is not necessary but it’s better to do it because you target the point of the interaction for these when you don’t connect it the fields interact where whatever they want to interact. Where you put the nano line, nano coated ganscoated wires you dictate where you want it to go. It’s like you want to from let’s say London to New York, you know you are going to new your you can direct it with the ship you can go with a plane you can even swim it single hanged if you can do it but then oun it you need to create a line if I go from here to there I want to go through this line. If I want to go from here to there I want it to be done by you don’t you lose some but hat you receive at the pint of interaction between the 2 sides of the plated the helmet and the plate is targeted this is the reason we use nano wire connections, to targeting to directing the fields which are in that area in what different way in you don’t have it the field spread open and if you don’t have it the field spreads open but whatever you don’t have it the field, now you when you narrow it when the nano coated material we direct it you position it that is the radon’s we do it , and of you system which we use for medical application its especially it’s important to understand this.<br>凯史先生：它不是必需的,但它是至关重要的。它不是必需的,但它是更好的，因为你把这些点的互动作为目标，当你不连接它，磁场的交互作用，无论怎样他们需要互动。在那里你放置纳米线，纳米涂层，甘斯涂层线，你决定你想要它去的地方。就好像你想要从，让我们说从伦敦到纽约，你知道你去纽约你可以直接坐船去，你可以坐飞机去，甚至于游泳去–它是死亡的单程票，如果你那么做的话。但是另一方面，你需要创建一条线，如果我从这里到那里，我想要通过这条线。如果我从这里到那里，我想要做到，你不能缺失一段。但是你的接头帽子你使用了电镀的金属在这个镀金的头盔两边之间，镀金板成了目标，这就是我们使用纳米线作为接头的原因。直接对准指挥场体目标，那是在不同的区域，不同的方法，你不能使场体延伸和打开，如果你不能使场体延伸和打开，但无论什么你不能获得它的磁场，现在，当你缩小它，当纳米涂层材料，我们指挥它，我们这么做，你把氡放在你的系统的适当的位置，那是我们专门用来为医疗系统的，理解这点是极其重要的。</p>
<p>Just because you can make does not mean it’s needed. We chose the copper the chose the zinc for a specific structure reason of the body of the man. Aluminium behaviour in the final transfer is different. You can use any metal to make a coils of but understand the field plasma which dictates it flow what energies you bring or take of add to the structure of the other gans materials. You have seen in the other parts you can connect differentmaterials you can use the gans you can now if you understood the field transfer you can build system which none of these is need but this is where we are hit is how we choose to do but avoid using aluminium coil especially aluminium coil if you understand that the problem I will explain to you how it works especially in a very minute structure which changes the field plasma, years ago 30 40 years ago unites nations made it illegal to do where they was a drought planes used to fly they still do in some cases but everything the governments won’t find out they fly at higher altitudes into the high moisture level of the upper atmosphere of what you call near the planet 2 3 10km whatever it is and they dispersed aluminium dust particle the moisture sticks to it and suddenly out of nowhere in the middle of the heat of the day you get a massive rain because the moisture difference creates rain  but in that process then we find out the aluminium process digests by the body of the man can create a lot of problem health problems because when you have it minute when it goes in the body it gets digested it be comes the gans of aluminium and create an interacts difference conditions.<br>仅仅是因为你可以制造并不意味着它是必要的。我们选择铜，选择锌的理由是由于人类的身体的特殊的结构。铝最终传递的行为是不同的，你可以使用任何金属去制造线圈，但是必须明白等离子磁场，那就是指挥它的场体流动，你在其他甘斯材料的结构中带来或者取走的是什么能量。你看见其他部分，你可以连接其他不同的材料，你可以使用甘斯，你可以，现在如果你明白了场体的变化，你可以建造系统，所有都不是一定的，但这就是我们必须精确地选择怎么去做，但是要避免使用铝，尤其是铝线圈，如果你明白那个问题，我将向你们解释，它如何工作尤其是在非常细微的显微结构下去改变等离子场体。很多年以前大约30-40年之前，联合国做了件非法的事情，在某些时候,他们会使用抗干旱的飞机但是政府不会在每一件事情上去发现，他们飞向更高的海拔高度进入高空大气层高水分水平你所谓的靠近地球2 3 10公理，不管怎样，他们散布铝粉颗粒物以增加降雨量，他们坚持这么做，在这期间突然不知道从哪里冒出来出现了极端炎热的天气，你获得大量的降雨，因为大气水分含量差异产生雨，但是在这个过程中然后我们发现铝粉会被人类的身体吸收会造成许多健康方面的问题，因为当你有微量的，当它进入到人体被人体消化，它就会变成铝甘斯，创建一种不同的交互影响的条件。</p>
<p>So please avoid using aluminium. Let me explain to you something now this that smoking maybe we can teaching a little bit differently, can I have the white board back please, I want to teach you something because you brought this up we just add to the knowledge, in your in the medical application in health application when you look to in the food digestion when you say this is the mouth of the man and you eat and it goes into your intestine and this is the what you call the body whatever I am not a very good drawer but its good enough.<br>所以请避免使用铝。让我给你解释一些事情，现在针对某些事情也许我们可以教导一点不同的，可以帮我把白板倒回去点吗？我想教导你一些事情，因为你带出来这个，我们仅仅是把它添加到这个知识里面，在你的健康方面的医学应用，当你看到食物消化，当你说这是男人的嘴，你吃的食物进入到你的肠道，这就是你们所说的身体，无论什么，我不是一个很好的抽屉，但是它是足够好的。</p>
<p>When you digest a food in the matter state ad it goes down at the point of entry as we have said before we changes its matter state and it becomes into the gans state, in entering the stomach the matter state start changing to nano material first through what you call the acids which are actually a conversion plasma condition matter into a gans state and the when they reach certain level of the gans state the body transfers into the intestine, At this point of intestine energy gravitational plasmatic magnetic field which is need by the body is release into the lymph but don’t forget instantaneous 0 time communication the need and the collaboration between the brain fields and the body parts so when you digest the food when it changes to gans and it becomes this plasmatic fields plasma which transfers across the body into the lymph then at this point what is requested by the brain because it knows what’s going to happen and the cell allows the with drawal of the energy from the lymph. This is from those for you who understood is very important because then you understand the energy to be absorbed from the food is pre-determined but the brain and the need by the cell. When it crosses and it converts into the field plasma it’s already predestined to where it’s going and its already targeted to be delivered.<br>当你在物质状态消化食物，它从入口下来，就像之前我们所说的，我们改变了它的物质状态使它变成甘斯状态，进入胃部后，物质状态开始转变成纳米材料通过你们所谓的胃酸，事实上是等离子体的条件使物质转变成甘斯状态，当他们达到某一水平的甘斯状态，身体把它们转移到肠道，在肠道这个点上，引力场等离子态的磁场能量需要身体把它们释放到淋巴，但是不要忘记，立即的我们需要大脑的场体与身体部分之间的零延迟的通讯合作，所以，当你消化食物，当它转变成甘斯，它变成等离子态磁场的等离子体，那个转变穿过身体进入到淋巴，然后在这个点上对大脑进行请求，因为它知道发生了什么，脑细胞总是从淋巴提取能量。你们理解这些对你们来说非常重要，因为此后你就能够明白预先决定大脑细胞需要从食物吸收什么能量。当它穿过和转变进入等离子磁场，它早已经注定要去到什么地方，它已经对准递送目标。</p>
<p>If you go back into the health teaching which we did last year with doctor Castova we touched on this section very clearly in the digestion system and the walls of the intestine, where we explained no matter every crosses the wall of the intestine it’s the energy of the plasmatic field which crosses the intestine wall and transfers tis energy to the lymph.  This was the very first time and in many teachings kept on explained this we spoke about the field plasma only fields of the gans within the intestine which have changed from matter to the nano to the gans now release the energy according to what is already predetermined by the cell needed and the by the brain that it might need or have a need for in the body. What is needed and done is taken from the digestion system to cross the wall other wise the food you eat all the energy stays in the lymphand the lymph will be mess of everything. Is predetermined through gravitational magnetic field strength which in the brain and the cell. The cell of a heart there is a cell of a love of a bone there is a cell of a liver all predetermined what to be taken from the food.<br>如果你回到上一年我们与凯斯托瓦医生的医疗健康教学，我们很清楚地谈及到消化系统这一段以及肠道的内部肠壁，在那里我们解释了没有任何物质穿过肠道内壁，是等离子态的能量场穿过肠道内壁转移它的能量到淋巴。这是非常快的时间，在许多教学里面我们都提到过这个解释，这是我们所说的关于等离子磁场，仅仅是甘斯的磁场在肠道内部，从物质转变到纳米到甘斯现在释放它们的能量，根据脑细胞早已决定的需要和大脑的可能的需要或者身体的需要。我们需要做的是，使你吃的食物的所有能量穿过消化系统的肠道内壁送到淋巴的手中，由淋巴去做所有的事情。那是由大脑和脑细胞通过磁引力场强度早已经决定好的。这里是一个心脏的细胞，这里是一个爱的细胞，这里是一个骨头的细胞，这里是肝脏细胞，所有从食物中获取的都是早已经决定好的。</p>
<p>And those which is no there is predetermined by the parenteral gland I take this surface because I can convert is using phosphate and sulphur. So you understand even how if you look in the structure of the body of men in certain positon of the body there are even lead. You find very very minute amount of similar gravitationalmagnetic field of strength of the lead in the kidney in the liver and in the large intestine. Because this is a point where the field who to separate what is not needed and the pulling can only come through higher level material and aluminium plays a very trick pint when I t comes to pull the energy because it’s in balance transfer is very similar in energy to energy which is used in certain part of the brain of the man and intestine with intellect. With the intellect string the of the body of the man in the brain strength don’t forget go back not the teaching go back in to the understanding of the past pain has specific gravitational magnetic field strength. Intellect is the same, comprehension, aluminium creates the specific field which is in the bandwidth of the intellect and depression. That’s you don’t use aluminiumbecause now that you have created aluminium field forces in your coils you make this free into digestion system and according to the brain, but I am getting fed up with and its going on what are you doing in my, he is making noise yeah because you keep on moving it. It’s too lose you have to bring it a little tis too high. (mumbles). So youunderstand the reason why you can’t use aluminium, because<br>但是对于那些在肠胃之外的没有经过肠胃消化的食物能量，我可以把它们放入罐子里去获取，因为我可以用磷酸盐和硫磺进行转化，所以你应该明白，如果你去观察人类的身体结构，在身体的某些器官中甚至存在铅，你会在人体的肾脏、肝脏和肠道里面发现非常非常微量和很小的铅的磁引力场强度。这表明这个磁场在那里被隔离起来因为这些是不需要的，只能通过更高级别的材料铝的引力，起到一个小的欺骗作用，使它达到拉拽能量的作用，因为总的来说它是非常相似的能量之间的转换，那使用了人类大脑中的某些部分以及肠道的智力。这是大脑能量在人类身体的智力线。不要忘记回到没有这个教学之前，回到过去对磁此引力场强度特性的理解认识之前，这个智力是一样的，理解，铝创建特殊的磁场在这个智力的带宽之中以及抑郁症。那就是你不能使用铝的原因。现在，你在你的线圈中制造了铝的场力，你使这个场力自由地进入消化系统，取决于大脑，但是我非常讨厌那个，你在对我做什么？他会制造噪音，因为你继续这样做。它是如此失败，你把它从很小的量带到太高的量。（喃喃自语）。所以你明白这就是为什么你不能使用铝的原因。因为……</p>
<p>第三部分笔译  fsociety—诗语<br>Aria: would it be a better solution to use silver instead of aluminium?<br>安利亚：用银线代替铝线会不会好点呢？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Pardon?<br>凯史：什么？我没听清楚，请再说一遍。</p>
<p>Aria: Would it be a better solution to use silver, silver coils?<br>安利亚：用银线代替铝线会不会好点呢？用银线。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: You got to understand you got to use what the body is used to, you cannot create, you sweet when you have these structures which you put the body in and you have put in the aluminium now you make the field of aluminium available, more than is needed in the body.<br>凯史：你要明白自己的身体需要的到底是什么，而不是代替身体做选择。如果身体并不过多地需要铝线提供的能量，而你却使用铝线制造健康单元，那么对身体反而是没有好处的，要根据身体的需要选用合适的材料制作健康单元。</p>
<p>Rick: What about in the magrav units Mr. Keshe, there is a question that somebody is already made up the aluminium coils for some magravs would that be ok or is that going to be,<br>瑞克：凯史先生，有人问可不可以用铝线制作能量单元呢？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Yes, you can use it but when you can apply it for the body you have to understand what it does this system is targeting for health use, its system is targeting, as we say in English there are horse for courses. And as we say as I said many times first we say whoever has a moustache is not your uncle just because you got a moustache just because you made it you don’t need use it.<br>凯史：可以的，但是制作健康单元时，你要知道自己制作的健康单元主要解决的是哪方面健康问题。要根据自己的身体所需选择合适的材料（不同的材料制作的健康单元侧重功效不同）。</p>
<p>Rick: But the coils that were made for this health unit coils hey be repurposed for magrav units perhaps<br>瑞克：要是制作健康单元的线圈被用改用于制作能量单元呢？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: we can use it for the space technology, for different application but do not and you see now we can explain it very easy because over past 2 、3 years we taught everything all you need is in achieves every bit comes together one way we apply about the transfer of the gravitational magnetic field plasma from intestine into; the lymph from the first week not you understand it that time could not be understood taken 2 years tie ah it already 2 years to see it and then you understand even what I explaining in the digestions system for our doctor team who sit in the background, each part each section of intestine has different strength and its strained it’s been developed to absorb different field strength  you don’t absorb your vitamin c all the way along you vitamin C  is absorbed n a given section of intestine then you have the section which only absorbs and allows the releases of the field from intestine into the plasma into the lymph of let’s say red meat and its composite or of nickel or whatever， so the whole structure because it is dynamic it goes back to the depth of the teaching if you understood it it’s very easy  each layer the stomach has exactly the same 3 layers as you skin and difference in the strength of each layer decides what is released from the gans plasma inside the intestine and going through into the lymph if you change slightly this one to this one then in that position in the stomach here you absorb vitamin A here you release vitamin D. When the scientist start understanding and going to the step one that the knowledge is release din to the structure to the stomach then the see how the fields how the field are releases from the stomach into the lymph.<br>凯史：可以改用在太空技术或者其他不同的应用领域。刚开始组织教学时从等离子层面讲人们对于淋巴系统还理解甚少，后来经过2、3年的教学，经过把各方面零散的知识整合到一起，人们已经能理解了等离子体是如何通过人体肠道的磁引力场转化出来并进入淋巴体统的，而且幕后的医疗团队甚至已经能从等离子体的角度理解人体消化系统的运行原理。<br>通过长期的教学，人们已经知道了肠道拥有不同的功能区去负责吸收不同的场体的能量并转化为等离子体进入到淋巴系统，比如维生素C或者瘦肉所含的镍元素都由肠道的某个特定的功能区负责吸收。胃壁也跟人的皮肤一样由3层组织构成，跟皮肤不同的是，胃壁的3层组织可以决定肠道内转化生成的甘斯等离子体哪些可以进入到淋巴系统，比如稍稍变动一下的话，在这个部位会吸收维生素A，另一个部位则会释放维生素D。最终科学家们会发各种场的能量是如何由胃释放进淋巴系统的。</p>
<p>[]: Mr. Keshe this is Francois when you mention the, yes when you mention the pituitary gland did you mean thyroid gland by any chance.<br>凯史先生，弗朗索瓦当谈到脑垂体时，我们还要提一下甲状腺了。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: You have thyroid glands are not that mentionable most of the thyroid glands are to do with the emotional physicality pituitary glands are to do with the physical part with the conversion of the fields<br>凯史：其实甲状腺与脑垂体的情感部分有关，并且参与场体能量的物理转化。</p>
<p>Francois: so what it pictorial gland or pituitary gland which you meant.<br>弗朗索瓦：那脑垂体到底是什么呢？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: pictorial gland because this, yes these 4 are part of the physical structure conversion of the field forces， one of them does the field conversion for the matters of the connection ，some of them does what the matters of the storage ，one of them does for the field transfer conversion for the matter state solid state to a plasma state and the one for them is responsible for most of the free fields conversion to calcium only, that supports the bone structure because at any structure if you don’t have a bone structure there is no life. The 4 pituitary glands have specific foundation for a specific way in guaranteeing the connection so the different fields to the gans of the state of the matter which is needed. Then the thyroid gland in the way operation of the bring controlling the physical operation of the totality. So when you go into the intestine you understand how it use so if you use a copper and you create a continuous copper you are feeding your copper coil in a balance state which is not needed but the field transfer through non, what you call lymph connection with the lymph converts and reaches and finds conversion in reaches aluminium in the emotional part of the brain that’s why you don’t touch aluminium it just it’s because of its magnetic field strength which causes this condition it’s not created if you go back to part of the teaching if you remember I explain this couple of months ago a few weeks ago where I explained when you look at the planet earth and they tell you that they found huge mountains of millions of years ago in somewhere 2 or 10 kilometres down I say no rain ever flow down. The reason is pure is because the gravitational magnetic field of the earth and its magma and its environment creates in that city where the gravitational magnetic field is equal to H2O that’s who the water was created. You have the main principle when you use between this and the aluminium in the brain of the man. You have to be very careful our new lead the cover of other materials which have this porter if they just happen in gravitational magnetic field of some of the isotopes they create the matter state of themselves in a gans state sold like a bone in a given part of the brain of the main they convert in field strength. That’s why better not use aluminium especially when it comes to use application with the body food because of the field transfers and its not all the aluminium isotope assigned to it one or 2 of them and it depends on the rate of the decay in one of the electron the boundary of this one. Any other question.<br>凯史：脑垂体共划分为4个功能区参与场体能量的转化。一部分负责物质与场体的连接，一部分负责物质的存储，第三部分负责将物质状态—–等离子体状态这一过程进行转换和传递。最后一部分负责将大量处于自由状态的场体能量只转化为钙，用来供应人体骨骼的需求，要知道生命是离不开骨骼的。这4部分功能区通过彼此之间相互协同合作确保了场体能量向甘斯状态和物质状态的能量状态转化，然后由甲状腺负责对人体整体进行统筹操作，整个吸收、转化过程由肠道，甲状腺，脑垂体共同参与。用铝线制作线圈的确可以实现场体能量的转换，但是铝线圈提供的能量并不是大脑的情感所需要的。在之前的教学中我也讲过地球上有许多几百万年前诞生的巨大山脉，在距离这些山脉2到10 公里处从来不会下雨。原因很简单，地球自身的磁引力场、岩浆和自身的环境会影响并产生可以生成水的磁引力场，雨水的形成跟使用线圈转化能量的原理一样。要非常谨慎地使用各种材料制作线圈，不同材料甚至其同位素材料制作的线圈会产生相对应的磁引力场在等离子体的层面实现能量向物质的转化，就像人体骨骼产生的过程一样。最好不要用铝线参与制作健康单元，并不是所有铝的同位素参与到能量转化这个过程中，比如有1、2种铝的同位素由于衰变率的原因（放射性同位素很不稳定）<br>就不能很好地参与进这个过程。还有其他问题吗？<br>Rick: Yes, we have a question from Motion I believe its motion even couple you want to go ahead,<br>瑞克： 有的，有一位名叫莫森的人有问题想请教您。</p>
<p>Motion: Yes, Rick than you, hello Mr. Keshe this is Motion from California and my question is that is it possible to use the field of plasma to tragdilling though the mater the matter itself would it be possible to use it that way<br>莫森：谢谢瑞克，凯史先生您好，我叫莫森来自美国加利福尼亚州。那么可不可以通过等离子能量场实现将能量转化变为物质呢？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Of course it would but a game play it would be one of the first fund of plasma technology, you create matter is very low so we can create …some noise in the background please. So what you need what you can do is, because the matter state is the lowest straight you create slightly higher but enough to be able to understand the gravitational magnetic field positioning of the matter state even though to you as we already done we understand in molecular structure the, we say the tightness but even if you go close into this this tightness has its own gravitational magnetic field positioning is not that they are compacted its still positioned but in a compact place but if you create in your system your field strength of this you can go through your matter like that because when you energy eat they open it and smoother out and the space become irrelevant because you dictate the position. This is part of the filtering system you can make with anno materials like to life get kidneys the work of the kidneys. Problem you don’t want to feed on anymore. So this is how you can do you can create the field vacuum you now understand the technology you understand the negative position and the sat there, structure of the fields you see how you can play with it you od got for the plasma to self you go for the gap between the plasma and if you create hat gap when you come in in that gap this has to find a new position so you can go through, its why we use this knowledge very very easily nowadays s I explained before in eh determine the technology.<br>We nowadays before if we remember 40 years ago 30 years ago we used to have to boil the cloth that it loosen he fibre spacing in the lost itself that the detergent he soap we use could clean, could actually interact with it and take it with itself now they do small dimension and they use the oil of orange it is the same thing it works on the same this but in smaller dimension, It uses smaller dimension to enter the gap in the plasma you use the strength of the field to position yourselves and when you position you can tell in plasma technology in afield plasma technology there is no state that the man could through and from one to another is just you have to add the knowledge to understand how to do it.<br>凯史：当然可以了，这要算等离子体科技的最基础功能了，用等离子场能量创造物质是比较简单的……话筒的噪音有点大啊。用等离子场能量创造物质是比较简单直接的，而且只懂得物质的分子结构组成原理是不行的，要充分地理解等离子体能量场，那么除了物质之外就可以创造出频率更高的“物质”。紧密物质有它自己的引力磁场定位，但这并意味着他们是紧密的，只是会在一个紧凑的环境里定位。但你可以通过磁场创造出物质，因为通过磁引力场你自己可以全程控制随意在宇宙中实现定位。你也可以用纳米材料制作过滤系统，这个过滤系统的作用就像人体的肾脏一样。现在你可以自己创造真空区，在充分理解了等离子体科技之后可以自己进行定位。现在你可以运用等离子体科技在宇宙中进行定位旅行，用等离子体科技进行太空旅行将会变得非常简单。30、40年前人类洗衣服先是用沸水煮衣服，高温加热拉开纤维之间的距离，然后用肥皂洗衣服，后来人们用桔子油清洗衣服，从更细小的层面看不管用什么洗衣服，道理都是一样的。从等离子体的层面看，用桔子油清洗衣服和在太空中定位也是一样的，都是通过磁引力场进入到等离子之间的缝隙在宇宙中实现定位，等离子体科技是无状态限制的，人们可以自由的从一个地方到另一个地方。</p>
<p>[]: Mr. Keshe would it be possible using the plasma energy to actually reduce the size of the matter for instance if there is massive as and as big as planet of earth would it be possible to use plasma energy to shrink or vice versa to make it bigger.<br>莫森：凯史先生，能通过等离子体能量场改变物质的尺寸吗？如果有一团大小跟地球差不多的物质，那么能通过等离子体能量场使它变得小或者变得更大吗？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: The thing is if you take energy in the plasmatic field from it then its plasma reduces in size the size of what I call the release and then its interaction decides if you are thinking making the earth pocket sized and go somewhere else and bring it out but you can do it but you can’t understand it how and what it the composition of the field. This is what we discuss about virus esand its exactly the e same how to we sharing a virus and how does it become effective we have seen it we saw the report from I just received a report from Ghana water centre its downstairs if Benjamin is online can show it to use they completed E. coli testing the different waters of the rivers.<br>凯史：如果从等离子体能量场里提取出一部分能量，那么表现在物质层次就是物质尺寸的减少。可以通过减少这团地球一样大小的物质的等离子体能量来使它尺寸变小，但你还是没有彻底地明白等离子体能量场体的构成原理。这跟转变病毒的性质（把病毒变成对人体有利的物质）是同一个道理，我刚刚收到一份加纳水中心的报告，本杰明在线的话可以向我们展示一下这份报告，他们对各种水质进行了大肠杆菌测试。</p>
<p>You have amino acid with E. coli. Then you have, then you have a plasma of the fields which attaches due to the strength of one of these 4 elements or combination of them that becomes supplier of energy into and in a way if you look at it take over it in the centre you have amino acid but you have energy package which is feeding it and at the present science in the world of medicine we know how to destroy bacteria because we can play with amino acid but we haven’t got enough knowledge to interfere with the extra energy which is much stronger amino acid they call it viruses.<br>凯史：现在获得了大肠杆菌的氨基酸，那么也就获得了相对应这个场体的等离子体，而这个场体能为维持病毒、细菌活性的氨基酸提供能量。目前，科学家们只知道如何通过摧毁氨基酸达到消灭细菌的目的，但他们不知道氨基酸之外还有更强大的场体维持氨基酸的活性，我们把这些更强大的氨基酸称为病毒。</p>
<p> Why the new plasma technology the new gans technology is effective with the viruses is very simple because here we have a plasma which is gans state or liquid state or field state now this has a spectrum of all the energies in the plasma, what do you do this in respect to the others we start exchange fields to find balance in exchange fields they give their energy to the plasma and the space in  between the slam with the other matter so what happens you drain it and gradually you still there would don’t touch the amino acid all you don’t you have depleted its energy and that how in space we have the same problem in space we don’t have amino acid we don’t have bacteria’s .<br>凯史：而等离子技术和甘斯技术对付病毒是如此的简单有效，不管是甘斯态、液态还是场态的等离子体都含有所有的能量光谱。在太空中场体之间通过等离子体间的能量的交换达到平衡，场体也会与物质发生碰撞会使物质的能量流向别处从而使物质的能量消耗完，可以不经过氨基酸直接得到物质的全部能量。所以，在太空中不存在任何氨基酸，任何细菌。</p>
<p>Bacterial are amino acid based according to the man amino acid magnetic field gravitational magnetic fields trength that why they tell you viruses we can handle bacteria we can handle bacteria and we see its good for E. coli and we use it for disinfectant and there is.<br>凯史：细菌其实就是氨基酸，而且是基于人体氨基酸的磁引力场产生的。所以人们觉得自己可以操控细菌和病毒，甚至可以用来参与消毒和影响大肠杆菌。</p>
<p> It just with the gans you create the condition you can deplete, not deplete bring balance the field between the fields in the environment the same is with the bacterial look at how the bacterial is created there are still another form of plasma whet you put it with the gans depending on finding the right gans you find out that you can use the gans to change bacteria this is what are talking with the doctors using the gans water for immunizing begins using the gans unit as is done by techco in infecting the mouse with the influenza can and then giving it the gans and giving it no side effects of toxicity and any influenza that how it works that’s why in this space you need it.<br>凯史：可以使用甘斯创造条件达到场域之间的能量平衡。同样的原理可以用于细菌，利用甘斯改变细菌的性质。医生也可用甘斯水用于对疾病的免疫，我们也曾经用甘斯喂养被流感病毒感染的小白鼠，最终证明甘斯不仅无毒副作用而且还治好了患流感的小白鼠，所以在太空中是可以用甘斯处理人体的。</p>
<p>You got to understand how to deplete it so this goes right everything else you can create out can deplete but then you dictate in the discussion we dahs and some of you already been there to use the patch your patch work exactly the same way why does your canceror patchor your what over patch you use on your but it works this is exactly how it works in your body. You put lets this is the organ whatever it could be and you patchthes adding you put a patch here I always say don’t use a single patch always us double patch it works more effective now you have the gans in here this is the difference gans works on the gradients different so what happens you drain it very quickly when we use your pens for information use 2 pen on either side you will see the different much rapid when you see a touches a patch that you sandwich it because now you have some free loses here  you have in traped in every shape or size it could be because you transfer its energy.<br>凯史：懂得了甘斯通过等离子体能量场消耗转化能量的道理就可以根据自己的需要创造出任何转态条件。比如甘斯贴治疗癌症就是运用的这个道理，2个甘斯贴的治病效果比单个的甘斯贴的效果更好，由于不同的甘斯对应不同的能量梯度（形成能量势差会加快患病处消极低频能量的向其他低势的能量流动，等同于水往低处流的道理，能量会从势能高的一端流向势能低的一端，从而使病患处能量流干，消耗完）就可以快速地转化能量，所以用2只点痛笔或者2条甘斯贴就比用单只点痛笔、单条甘斯贴治病效果更快。</p>
<p> In time if you go back few weeks ago I spoke about the time machine travelling in 0 time by the strength of the field that exactly what you do you find the position of the universe when you put yourself in the position which when the 2 the direction you want to go instant travel you don’t need to be in the field you don’t need to bend what you need you done have a engine how did man travel for centuries with a curtain on the boat flying over the oceans as we call sailing now we have knowledge in your system we can create the sales of the gravitational magnetic field strength to get of the wind so the magnetic field so the universe you don’t need to burn anything and if you get the strength right you travel at the so be if the wind is very soft you float and if you get yourself in the high wind you get free travel high speed across now you have to transfer the knowledge in difference way that the  strength of the fields works in respect to the weakest to the strongest the strongest lay feed to bring the weakest to its position.<br>凯史：几周前，我说过时间旅行要在时间为零的能量场中进行，在宇宙中可以通过双向定位实现瞬间旅行。在宇宙中旅行并不需要任何机器引擎，摆脱任何物质的的限制，不再像人类几个世纪以来需要船帆为航海提供动力。现在我们可以创造磁引力场为宇宙旅行提供动力，不再需要任何燃料。就像柔风和疾风会让你处于不同的漂流状态一样，现在要做的就是通过能量的转换把柔风转化为疾风，可以无忧无虑地在宇宙里旅行。</p>

<p>（抽样视频开始时间为96:53） IN the patches (you made with ) CO2, the CO2 patches are the weak part the virus is more intense higher so what is do there is carbon and oxygen is already part of the your amino acid so now you create (the weaker point) the energy flows if you look at it in reality (I )go back 129 your main reactor energy is your (organ) is(  )  129 reactor in the centre because this is COHN plus some extra energy (from whatever)and you have fixed this (one) to CO2 and this one to the CO2 what happens? 129 fed the other reactors so it tries to give the energy to bring it the balance (you find everything there is )(        )you want to take you place (a) weaker field you (want) to add you put a higher filed this is why if you look I was explaining this yesterday doctor’s teaching the (magnets) are still here how do we do it we target it if you want to do (it) you actually can increase and directionalize you do same thing with your gans (you do the same thing with your material in your gans) containers.<br>凯史： 因为CO2甘斯包通常用语治疗由病毒和细菌引起的疾病，在CO2甘斯贴这一侧会有大量病毒聚集，同时人体氨基酸包含C、O 元素，而且CO2甘斯处于能量低势端，这时就要创造一个比CO2甘斯更低的能量势能，使聚集在CO2甘斯贴这一端病毒的能量流向更低势的那一端，消耗完病毒的能量。再看中间的129反应器，它就好比是人类的器官，COHN又增加了一些额外的能量并混合了一些CO2甘斯，那么会发生什么呢？129反应器回向其周围他拥有低能量场体的应器输送能量以实现能量平衡，昨天的医疗团队教学中我也讲过，也可以用纳米材料如此操作。</p>
<p>(in my health unit ) I dictate the magnets the strength of the magnet flat magnet or the ring magnet the square magnet or( the) rectangular magnet. Each one plays a game. I want to directionalize ( fields ) I put it this way I want to have equal but central difference coming out of the plate I use the square I want to be flat enough to dictate the size of the plasma I use a flat line. There are all here you see it.<br>凯史：不管条形磁铁、圆形磁铁、还是正方体、长方体的磁铁，我可以控制它们的磁力强度。每个人玩游戏都在想，我要用这种方式发现磁场的秘密，我用正方体是想让它变得更平坦，更好的控制等离子体的尺寸，还要用到平行线。看，这就这些磁铁。</p>
<p>This is the 3rd one this is (a) flat one different thickness (different strength)and then what you decide is am I playing another to north or am I playing south to south or am I playing north to south and then if it’s a bigger strength compared to this smaller and its if going (north) to north or its going in this way north to north where in fact here in the (cop in ) the middle where the (cup where the )water is I want this with this.<br>(Then) I know at this  point I need the energy of hydrogen (to) be delivered what do I do I put liquid glue gans which is high CH which(  )(means) it releases energy to it I use a speck of nano copper oxide or a (speck )of what I like to have nano zinc now you target it if you have some of the cups I have made past (5) or (in )10 years(if you open) it will take centuries to understand the principle (each one has been)put (   )together(and has been built)  it takes man( knowledge for )years to understand what (I ) have built (which means ) second nature I know how to push how to (build and ) then because its plasmatic (its) left to the emotion of the man to receive or not to receives because it still needs that emotional need to confirm its existence that why you build a （system） and you find out people don’t do anything with them because you give but (there) expectation is if I expect I will not revive what I am looking for which is (  )  (I want to take to bring and then the system doesn’t work with someone the system works )with everyone but allows the priority of the emotion of (decisioning)  if you want  to override( it )load it up with a what you call zinc gans and zinc materials and then you (will find out) you can dictate any condition and this is not the purpose (that’s why we bring the feed system , it’s there if you want to take )  (  )<br>You can play if you understand a lot of thing now that you play with the gans materials (the magnets are too weak ) but you can use magnets to target (  )  to confine to (hold)  the same as you use the clothes to hold the gans for the plasmas liquid plasma I have used for years’ magnets to do the same because now within the structure most of these (somewhere ) they have this which connects to the blood of (the man through) haemoglobin.

(抽样视频结束时间为103:54)<br>凯史：这是第三个条形磁铁，有不同厚度和磁场强度，然后我会把两个圆形磁铁北极对着北极，条形南极对着南极或者条形磁铁的南极对圆形磁铁的北极…这样玩,比较哪种情况下产生的磁力比较大，在产生的磁场中间这一点正是我想要的。<br>在这一点上我需要氢传递能量， CH液态甘斯作为“胶水”会释放向氢能量，然后是少量的CUO甘斯或者少量的包纳米锌材料，在这一点上准备工作就完成了。我在过去5年~10年制造出的杯子就包含了如此多的等离子体知识，人类要用几百年的时间去充分理解如此多的知识。等子离子体需要与人的情感连接，当你制作出一个能量系统后，就不需要做任何其他的事情了，要做的只有期盼和渴望，能量系统会优先服务于产生期盼渴望心情的人。你会发现使用纳米锌材料和锌甘斯可以驾驭任何能量系统，能控制任何状况，正因为人类对食物有渴望的心态，食物系统才得以向公众推出。<br>只要你充分掌握了等离子体的知识，就可以通过甘斯、纳米材料畅游于知识的海洋。虽然磁铁产生的能量太弱，但仍然可以利用磁铁，就像用布料包裹甘斯材料一样，其结构就像人体的血红蛋白一样。等离子体科技可以帮助人类非常简单实现任何梦想，比如愈癌症患者只在一个机器中治疗就可以在几秒钟内就修复身体进而痊愈。但是要记住人的情绪体是需要得到喂养的，当情绪提感到满足人体的疾病也就自然痊愈了。只要人类的大脑愿意，它就完全有能力治愈自身的癌症，从根本上来讲其实人类不需要任何能量系统，自己就可以治愈自身。还有其它问题吗？</p>
<p>Rick: Mr. Keshe is have a question regarding a grounding of system or the idea of trying to reconcile the idea that people have they call it going when people go with the for explain with bare feet and go on the ground of the earth that’s sort of is a technique to ground yourself they call it and at the same time we have some systems have a grounding point has is used and other like the salt water as a place for the plasma to dump essentially kind of grounded essentially  so can you explain a little bit about that thing, obviously in space we have the earth to ground to.<br>瑞克：凯史先生，有一个问题是关于飞行器的着陆系统的，就好比人类能光脚在地面上行走，同时还有些系统着陆时会有着陆架。那么您能解释一下是在太空中着陆容易呢，还是在地球上着陆更容易？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: NO you can ground in space easier than on earth<br>凯史：不，在太空中要比在地球上更容易着陆。</p>
<p>Rick: could you explain that then?<br>瑞克：您能解释一下吗？</p>
<p>第四部分笔译 自在的心<br>Mr. Keshe: I do this a lot my neighbour thinks I am crazy sometime they look at me I walk bare foot on the ground  quite a lot I find a lot of pleasure in it because I receive what I don’t have physically and I give what I don’t need。 I enjoying laying on the ground quite a lot especially when you need to concentrate it brings you and you give and you take to bring balance between the physicality and the emotion the earthworks the same ask just explained as the magnets and pads it releases fields in the matte of states of what it has and what you need and that you don’t want and what you give.<br>凯史：这个我做了很多，我的邻居认为我疯了，一段时间他们看着我我光着脚走路，我发现很多乐趣，因为我收到我身体上没有的和我给出我所不需要的，我喜欢躺在地上，尤其是当你需要关注它，它带给你， 你给予或获取，带来的身体与情感的平衡，地球也是这样运作，这解释为磁铁和垫在它的物质状态下，释放相应的你所需要的和你不想要的和你给予的场。<br>People who would sleep on high towers you find different behaviours than people who sleep in the field and energy now and then we need it we need to exchange field in way to bring balance in our life it’s a condition. The dumping is surface energy which you put into a system which you donot need but with what you call walking bare foot or even you can use your head you can use your hands to bring balance you find I do this without noticing but I know why I do but I tend to bring a time to stick my hands and I put my head I against the wall and if you put the head again the way there is a concrete you don’t get much but if you use a brick wall.<br>What do you call it a stone wall there is a head against the wall you find you get different energies we tune into the environment its technique we use or centuries for those who understand it and explain this transfer of energy in couple of weeks ago when you pen of the pain pens in your hand and you don’t direct it and you take and give in the balance what you need. This balancing is essential is the filtering of emotional fields itis not so much in the matter state and you find out for example when your lie on the sand of the beach you discharge on different sand in different sands If you go to white or you go to volcanic sand the discharge I very different you see different behavior, because you get rid of the strength field and its essential, it’s got to be part of every man,you are able to bring balance and its done, its done for those who understand who are quite often, walk quite often bare footed on the ground . </p>
<p>那些在高塔上睡觉的人和在田野里中睡觉的人，你会发现他们有不同的行为，我们需要能量场交换以给我们的生活带来平衡，这是一种条件，然后我们需要它，我们需要交换能量场，以给我们生活带来平衡，这是一个条件。倾泻能量是把你不需要的一种表面能量倾倒入一个系统中，但你把它叫做光脚走路或者你也可以用你的头和手来给你带来平衡，你发现我不注意的做这个事情，但我知道我为什么做，但我倾向于有一段时间把我的手，我的头，靠在墙上，如果把你的头靠的是混泥土，你得不到太多，如果你用的是一堵砖墙，或者你称为石头墙，你会发现你获得了不同的能量，我们把能量转换到环境中。这个技术对那些懂得它的人来说我们用了很多世纪。在几个星期前，我教了这个技术，当你用止痛笔点你的手，你并不引导它，你获取你平衡所需的东西。这种平衡必不可少的是过滤情感场，与物质状态关系不大，比如当你躺在沙滩上放电，不同的沙子是不同的，如果你躺在白沙子或者你躺在火山沙上面是放电非常不同，因为你摆脱的能量场的强度不同，这很有必要，这是每个人的一部分，你能带来平衡，并且它做到了，那些理解了，并且经常赤脚在地上走的人做到了。</p>
<p>Because it allows to me to transfer what is I need and what I don’t need back in the physically.in this time I can’t solve thing is just lie down on the floor, doesn’t matter where it is because you receive and you bring what you don’t want . The dumping is part of the of the process in way what you give what you don’t need is taken but you give to the higher gravitational field. It as a huge application in space. If you know how to dump, where to dump it very effective way for discharge of energy especially if you have met ice ahead of you, you have areas where you don’t want to destroy but dumping you saturate it has huge application. Exactly what I explain with washing you releasing so much energy that gravity and magnetic field strengthens the cells of the structure , increase so much the big gap , and the positioning increased, so you can go through. you do it by dumping said energy into an new area ,you carry a space ship known to carry high energy packets just for this job it’s not a missile if you use it on earth you will not see a thing because it will literally dissolve like sugar in hot water. </p>
<p>因为在这段时间里面它让我能够转换我身体所需要的和我所不需要的，当我遇到不能解决事情的时候，只是躺在地上，不管在哪，因为你接收和给出你所不需要的。倾泻是一种将你不需要的带走的处理方法，你把它给了的更高的引力场。它在太空中有着巨大的应用。如果你知道怎样倾倒，在哪里倾倒，它是一种非常有效的释放能量的方法，尤其是当你前面遇到冰，或者你不想毁坏这个地方，而是把你饱和的能量倾倒出来。它有巨大的应用。正如我解释的清洗你的能量，你释放了磁引力场的大量的能量，加强了细胞的结构，拉大了间隙， 位置升高，你能够通过了。你只是将能量倾倒到新的地区，你携带一个太空船，携带一个高能量包，就是做这个的，这不是一个导弹，如果你在地球上使用它，你将不会看到导弹，因为它会像糖在热水中一样溶解</p>
<p>It is very very easy. This is what I said you can take the radar in no time we don’t destroy then we just started them with energy they are not even there to do their job, Dumping and I slowly start teaching with that if you notice I start teaching a techniques not systems and this is also understand using this techniques can do a lot of things .in past 2 3 weeks I start teaching techniques not systems. Now having the techiniques to create wind ,how to dump ,how to create emotion by using the system how to communicate without having a system. How would you call form the other side of the universe neither on earth till man of the energy I have ran out of everything can I have help, you can waiting there for millions years, or instantaneously and this is one of them dumping this is way you what you need and you can hold it or control it or you share it .you see want you need it? You usually use high unbalance field plasma for dumping for a storage of energy.</p>
<p>这非常容易，这是我说的，你可以在任何时候去除雷达，我们没有摧毁的雷达，我们只是用能量使他们都无法工作。倾泻技术我慢慢开始教学，如果你注意到我开始教一个技术而不是系统，理解使用他们的技术可以做很多的事情。在过去2到3周我开始教学技术而不使系统。现在拥有了创建风的技术，如何倾泻能量，如何利用系统创造情感， 如何在没有系统的情况下通讯，你如何呼唤在宇宙的另一边，当你的能量用完的时候，能获得帮助吗？你可以在那里等待几百万年。倾泻是其中的一种你需要的方法，你拥有它，控制它或者分享它。你通常使用高度不平衡的场等离子体来倾倒储存的能量。</p>
<p> Usually Isotopes of matter elements which have very low radioactive phase for the very high cosmic radiation base. And they compensate for one for the other and the store energy or the capacitors of the energy and light is one of them. You get to chance walk on the grounds in different sand you see the feeling it changes you walk on different ground you take different feelings that’s why human race is more and more detached society wise because we sleeping on the mattress which is all predetermined with all sort damage in it. Humanity stays more or less the same when you understand you are connected to the point of your own creation. I was explaining very some time ago that most of the diseases man is suffering from is from the matter which he sleep on. The ions the materials which is used to contaminate materials to are not match our body and they will transfer energy continuously we transfer energy to our environment and these places are fixed the environment where you live we interact with. Try to sleep in the room which is full of nano coated zinc and I will tell you have has been 2 days’ time I will tell what happens. You will walk loving every creatures in the universe because your emotion is satisfied which is the point that you will receive what you need. </p>
<p>通常用非常低放射性的物质元素的同位素作为高的宇宙辐射基础。他们可以互相补，储存能量或作为能量电容，光是其中之一。你有机会在不同的沙子上行走，你会感受到感觉的变化，在不同的地上行走，你的感觉也不同， 你看到感觉它改变你走在不同的地面你采取不同的感觉。这就是为什么人类越来越脱离社会智慧，因为我们睡在床垫上，这一切预先设定了，并且有某种程度的损害，人类或多或少都一样，当你明白你连接到你自己的创造点。有一段时间我在解释，大多数生病的人在承受他们所睡的床垫所带来的痛苦，这些材料中使用的金属材料与我们的身体不匹配，它们持续的传送能量到环境中，到你固定居住并与我们互动的环境中。你尝试着在充满了纳米锌的房间中睡两天，我会告诉你会发生什么。你会爱宇宙中的一切生物，因为你的情感得到满足，你收到你所需要的。</p>
<p>第五部分笔译  慕容寒星<br>Rick: Well Aria, Roney had early in their chat can human create and control field without having any gans or gans wager around as the human in the plasm state and contains almost all material such as CO2 and copper oxide CH3 etc.? And you went on a little more, you can do, of course you can do. But how to control the rotation and create different conditions are they different emotions.<br>瑞克：好的，安瑞亚，Roney早就在讨论关于人们创建和控制磁场处于任何甘斯和甘斯边界在人体等离子体周围，几乎包含所有的物质，例如二氧化碳甘斯、铜甘斯、甲基甘斯等等？你们只需要一点点，你就能做，当然，你是能做的。但如何控制反应器，控制不同的条件处于不同的情绪状态。<br>Mr. Keshe: You got to learn it first, you got to learn yourself you got to understand your being and you can create anything once or you can let other see it so it need a lot of discipline and understanding what to release and the depends what you want , what you want with the audience of what you create you can hold your hands and play sorts of games I have seen you sitting here and they talk about it and they push and they and you can do starting here looking to the sky so you want to see a mater right there because you see a condition of the man and with the matter state. It’s very easy but first you have to understand what you want to do with it. What’s the purpose of it? You hold your hand and I, we talked about this last year in respect to what Caroline said hold your hand in video, on plasma. It needs a lot of understanding of your own strength. Any other?<br>凯史：首先你会学到，你得明白学习你自身，明白怎样成就你自己，并且你能创造再次创造一切。你能让其他人看到它，所以它需要大量的训练和理解释放了多少，我在各种游戏中看到你就在那，他们讨论这个。他们推进这个，并且你现在就开始关注天空。所以你需要看到一个母船在那，因为你所看到了一个人类的环境，在一个物质的状态。这是非常容易的，但首先你必须理解你在做的是什么。你对它有什么期望？你与我携手，我们一起讨论去年尊敬卡若琳在视频中说的举起你的手，在等离子体中。这需要大量的理解你自身的力量。还有其它的吗？<br>[]: Yes Mr. Keshe This is again Marcel from California.  Mr. Keshe You’re always mentioning the creating the matter the plasma is an art I was wondering if you can explain a little bit more about this subject.<br>：是的，开始先生。我是加利福尼亚的Marcel，还有个问题，凯史先生，你总是强调创造物质等离子体是一个艺术，我有点疑惑的是假如你能解释一个小小比这更多的主题。<br>Mr. Keshe: You can create matter out of plasma when you understand the fields you. When you understand at what point the field strength reduces enough to be at the matter state. When you have a plasma, plasma was through his own releases of energy to his environment, if you control the environment to his control that you decide the rate of reduction then you can create anything which in your hands. You can put your hand out with looking at the with you bring you can create each field that at the ping of the hand the energy from your brain reduces so much that it becomes gold in your hand then anybody can see so you put the skin the strength of the feeling through the motion of the hand which comes from the brain itself in a way to pleasure and neuron system and the limit of gold now you want bread it will be bread. You have to dictate a boundary of the strength and with your emotion you have all you need, you dictated it with your hand you dictate the position. A lot of you have done this but its understanding how much you need at what point you put your hand our 20cm  you got no bread you begin it 10cm you get bread and you actually physical to touch give to other people, eat it. Christ bless his name 2 or 3 times but people didn’t see it. This is my body this is my blood that’s how it was done intention of the thought through the physicality of the entity. Any other question?<br>凯史：当你理解了你自身的场，你就能在等离子体外创造物质。当你理解场强减弱了多少到足够程度就能是在物质世界。当你有个等离子体，等离子体会通过自身释放能量到这个环境。如果你能控制环境中它所控制的，那么你决定减少的比例，然后你就能在你的手中创造一切。你能将其掌握在你手中，你会注意到你所带来能够通过创建场体来掌控能量，通过你的大脑减少的了多少你就创造了黄金，然后每个人都能看见。所以你就能体会到强大的感觉通过你所所创造出来的。它是一种通向快乐的神经系统，也是金子在做限制。你想要面包它就会成为面包。你需要通过情绪描绘出一个能量边界，来全部获取你想要得到的。通过你自己说出位置的口令。有许多事情你要去做，但要理解你需要多少来表明离我们的手20CM。你没有获取面包你就开始向内移动10厘米，这样你就有了面包，事实上你所接触到的物质的能够给予其它人，能够摄取它。主基督耶稣能保佑他两次三次，但人们从未看见他。这是我的身体，这是我的血液，它显示出通过清晰地思维能够看到物质世界的真实意图。还有别的问题吗？<br>Rick: Three was a question from Monique’s in the chat about the again going back to the aluminium coils from the magrav boxes she is conserved that you will be livening he field of the aluminium the zinc at home and that might not be good. Is that the way it works wait I understand it’s the field is many contaminated with the immediate area of the coils and so on with the magrav unit itself more than the health unit which is designed to actually transfer has a greater gradient between the 2 sets of coils that’s a different situation. Can you explain that Mr. Keshe is that?<br>瑞克：三个来自莫妮卡所正在讨论的问题，再次回到铝制线圈所做的磁引力场能量单元。她对你说的在铝的线圈磁场是保守的态度。镀锌的放在家中似乎不怎么好。用那种让其待机的方式，我理解的是场体会立即污染大面积的线圈 ，在能量单元本身超过健康单元事实上被设计转换两个线圈之间不同位置的梯度，你能解释那个吗？凯史先生<br>Mr. Keshe: It’s with the health units, you use the fields, we have been using the magrav fields aluminium we are open to the space to take it’s a different thing you sandwich the body to a different thing, it has nowhere to go it has nothing to interact with in away but with when you have in the house you have it you share with the rest of the environment in the room. It’s a big difference.<br>凯史：这是医疗单元，你使用场体，我们已经使用铝的磁场，我们采取了打开不同事物的空间在你身体的三明治层，它无处不在相互影响，当你身在其中，你会分享房间环境中其余的能量，这是最大的不同。<br>Rick: Thank you,<br>瑞克：谢谢你<br>Mr. Keshe: if, sorry about that if you are a stuck in this process of containment in, let’s say in a nuclear disaster or the nuclear power stations we can use this knowledge this knowledge very effectively to contain all the radiation we have seen with techco with the conversion of energy but with understanding this containment with the field gans you can do wonders. You can contain any radioactive leakage from any source just using the field you don’t need the containers. Any other question?<br>凯史：假如，抱歉，假如你进入密闭的环境之中，那就是说是一个核灾难是的在或者说原子能发电厂。我们能够应用这个只是非常有效的吸收辐射。我们已经看到techco已经转化了那些。对于这个甘斯场体吸收辐射的理解，你能做很棒！你能转化一切源于核放射的泄漏物，仅仅是使用场体。你本身不许要吸收。还有其它问题吗？<br>Rick: I have got a couple of views I think Monique might want to speak over here and Crystal Walk also and JKO.<br>瑞克：我有一个多张图片，我想莫妮卡也许想要说在哪里的水晶移动和JKO<br>[Turibian]: Hello, this is Turibian from Norway.<br>Turibian：你好，我是挪威的Turibian<br>Rick: Hi<br>瑞克：嗨！<br>Turibian: I have a very precise, excuse me Mr. Keshe?<br>Turibian：我是非常严肃的，打扰了，凯史先生。<br>Mr. Keshe: We are listening<br>凯史：我们在听。<br>Turibiani: Yesterday I received a patient with cancer he is, he don’t have a much help for the doctors and I gave him 40 minutes within the walls although he have the cell what we call here self-poison it’s a, through the blood poison through the blood for cancer treatment and he, is about to choose plasma rather than this self-treatment and he felt that something really good was going on but he was very very tired and so he spent first 10 minutes between the walls and then  he got out to breathe some air and then he got in again<br>Turibiani：昨天，我接待了一个癌症患者，这是他，他没在医生那里得到足够的帮助，我给了他40分钟的场体治疗。尽管他到了被我们称作自身污染到细胞，他通过癌症治疗他的血液毒素，他正打算要用等离子体治疗而不是自我疗愈。他感觉一切确实朝着很好的方向发展，但他非常非常疲倦，所以他用了十分钟在医疗单元里然后他呼吸了一会空气又进去了。<br>Mr. Keshe: I am gonna stop you there have you find yourself a doctor to work with.<br>凯史：我在那里停下。你找到一个你自身的医生工作在这吗？<br>Turibani: His, a friend has been following him for 9 years but no doctor’s no<br>Turibani：他是我的一个朋友，相处了九年，但他不是医生。<br>Mr. Keshe: I am not gonna answer till you find yourself a doctor. I am very very precise, it was for yourself I advise and I will also give you for, find yourself a doctor that you can monitor things.<br>凯史：我不能（肯定）的回答去寻找你自身的医生。我可以明确的说，这是我对你自己的忠告，我同样也可以告诉你，发现你自己的内在医生那是你能轻松做到的事。<br>Turibani: Yes, we took a film of the visit.<br>Turibani：我将拍摄一个影片作为这个的访问。<br>Mr. Keshe: Doesn’t matter you go to get yourself a doctor work with a doctor he can join doctor Rodriguez in US or other doctors that are actually in Paris in Middle East or other doctors but do not do these things just because you got the ball you do it and I explain that to you before, with the number of doctors we have number of Italian doctors who are going in the teaching use them and explain that relationship and whatever and let them advice you. You become a what you call it, extra technician but not the X-ray doctor not a radiologist. You have to understand this a lot of people are building these systems and using it with those people who got but it has to be done correctly and I advise you and I think in Norway they are doctors who work around the foundation. Go and work with them.<br>凯史：寻求你内在的医生将之当做一个医生来工作室没有问题的，他能加入到美国的Rodriguez医生或者其他医生换言之是在巴黎中间或者东方的其他医生。但别去做哪些事情仅仅因为你得到一个你做的球，我在之前解释过那些。与这么多的医生我们已经有些意大利的能教授使用它们的医生，解释那种关系，无论是什么。让他们给你建议。你成为一个你所称之的，特别技师，但不是研究使用X光机的医生。你一定理解这是许多人们正在构建的那些系统，使用这个给那些需要的到正确治疗的人们。我建议你并且我想在挪威，他们运作在基金会的那些医生。去那里并和他们一起工作。<br>Turibani: But I am have a question, I gave him liquid plasma copper based and liquid plasma zinc based 2 glasses and I have report that he is feeling better but he saying that his relaxation is feel differently.<br>Turibani:但，我有个问题，我给了他液态的等离子体铜部分，液态等离子体锌基于2个玻璃容器内，我已经写出了他感觉良好的报告，但他说这是一种与众不同的轻松感。<br>Mr. Keshe: I don’t know; I prefer you do discuss this with a doctor. I explain this to you before and I go the same way you build the system and you can put in the middle of the square and people can work with it tell them this does the cancer, this does that but to understand this does process and what it does which way it falls. And this discussion we had it before your beautiful system you are very active but please get yourself a doctor you can work with, write at doctors @keshefoundation.org and work with one of the doctors we work with you remote it’s not a problem but it works supervise and it’s almost happening please.<br>凯史：我不知道，我更喜欢你讨论这个医生。我解释了在你以前，我走过了相同的路。你构建这个系统而你能将它放到工作之中，告诉人们在中心处能这样工作。这么做就能明白这个工作过程，当她下降时又能做什么。我们会在你漂亮的系统之前进行讨论，你是非常活跃的，但请给自己找个医生，你能这样工作，写信给医生凯史基金会网址，并与其中一个人一起工作。我们会是在远程的运作，这不是问题，但这工作受到监管，这也几乎正在发生。<br>Turibani: Yes, I am working with Clause.<br>Turibiani：是的我工作在克罗斯。<br>Mr. Keshe: Yeah try to get yourself fixed because it is important and then whatever you find out with the doctor’s supervision you can add to your wallet you have to do it this way in order, anybody does anything else. When you come on you bring a lot of things on the table which you have to understand. Thank you very much. Thank you Mr. Keshe. Any other question?<br>凯史：是的，试着让你自身保持明确，因为这是非常重要的，那么无论你找到医生的监管，你都能增加你的能量。你必须按照一定顺序来做。每个人都能做任何事。当你来到你所带来的明面上的事物是，你就会得到理解。非常感谢你，谢谢你！还有其它问题吗？<br>Rick: I think someone called Redstone watch had a question do you want to un mute you and see what you have to say there.<br>瑞克：我想有个叫红石的有个问题，你想要减弱你所看见的就如你所说的。<br>[]: Hello Mr. Keshe<br>：你好，凯史先生<br>Mr. Keshe: Hello<br>凯史：你好<br>[]; New Zealand. Just a question I have on the outside I have linked up 7 magrav coils and linked it through to my food and I have a metal roof and I got quite a large energy field which is slowly coming through the ceiling and entering my room.<br>：新西兰，有一个问题，我在外头我连接了7个能量线圈，我连接单元通过我自己制作的食物，我有一个金属盖子，并且我产生了一个相当大的能量场通过缓慢的越过能量上限，进入我的房间。<br>Mr. Keshe: Why have to done that for? Are you trying to fly or take the whole house to fly?<br>凯史：为什么必须要那么做？你想要尝试飞行还是让整个房子飞起来？<br>[]; No its just the reaction the energy field of the magrav are trying to work on its just an idea I have just a wee bit of feedback will be kind of<br>：不是的，它仅仅是能量场体的磁场反应，它通过尝试在这工作，它仅仅是个设想，我有些好的东西在我的脸书里。<br>Mr. Keshe: What do you feel in the house?<br>凯史：你感觉你的房子是什么？<br>[]; It just seems a wee bit calmer, initially you said with zinc and, you can get an energy field it I suppose it’s like large capacitor. Just trying to get the plasma to.<br>：似乎有点安静，最初你说用锌，你能创造一个能量场。我想，它好像是一个大的电容，仅仅在等离子层面。<br>Mr. Keshe: The point is to stack of 7 on top of each other.<br>凯史：问题在于相互层叠的7至顶层<br>[]: No series yes. From one coil to the next.<br>：不是连续的吧，从第一个线圈然后接下去。<br>Mr. Keshe: Where if the magnetical of the last one connected to? You know when you go from gravitational to magnetical, magnetical to gravitational and you have one end which is gravitational in your hand and you have one end magnetical of the 7th coil and you have the gravitational of the first coil where are these 2 connected?<br>凯史：假如磁力场在前一个地方进行了连接，会在哪里呢？你要知道，当你从引力场出发到磁力场，磁力场再到引力场，你有这一端，从你手中出发的是引力场，你就有一个在迪层的磁力场线圈端。而你有第一个引力场线圈就会有2个地方的连接？<br>[]: There are just like gravitational to magnetic it’s the<br>：那看起来仅仅是引力到磁力。<br>Mr. Keshe: But where is first gravitational connected to and where is last magnetical connected to?<br>凯史：但，哪里是第一个引力场连接到磁力场的哪里呢？<br>[]: I will have to I haven’t got a photo with me it’s difficult to, and you ask whether the house is connected to mains or?<br>：我将会有，我没有给他们的异同之处拍照，而你询问是否房子能连接上主源？<br>Mr. Keshe: No you have a stacker unit in your hand you do the stacker 7 of them and you have connected them when you connected the stacker 7 of them together you have 2 ends in your hand<br>凯史：不，你手上有一个能量单元堆，你做第七层，你要连接他们但你连接到它们的第七层，你的手中有2个终点。<br>[]: Yes, I connected them all in series just like<br>：是的，我连接他们所有的正如连续的。<br>Mr. Keshe: I understand that, the 7 is connected in series one to another yes? The end of the way you have 7 of them on top of each other, yes. The last coil the 7th one has a magnetical coming out wire, where is that connected to?<br>凯史：我理解那个，7层是连接系列1到其它的，是吗？在最后一步，你有7层到顶层互相挨着的，是的。最后线圈到第七层是一个磁力场连接到线，哪里是要连接那个的？<br>[]; I have actually put that through a single cable and gone to my roof.<br>：事实上我将那个放在那里，通过单芯电缆放在了屋顶上。<br>Mr. Keshe: Where is the first coil gravitation connected to?<br>凯史：哪里是第一个连接到阴历线圈的地方？<br>[]; A capacitor.<br>：一个电容<br>Mr. Keshe: And where is the end of a capacitor in the gravitational of the capacitor connected to?<br>凯史：哪里是引力场通过电容连接再到最后电容出来的地方？<br>[]: To the neutral.<br>：在中间。<br>Mr. Keshe: Stick to the Antenna of the house or stick it to the antenna and leave it that way and tell me how you feel in about 2 weeks’ time. But keep your magnetical connected to your roof.<br>凯史：固定到房间内的天线到室外的天线，离开那个地，并告诉我你在这两周的感觉是怎样的。但要保持你的磁力场线圈在屋顶。<br>[]; ok<br>：好的。<br>Mr. Keshe: Because this way you receive energy from the environment from the cosmos which is massive amount and then you bring it down and you connect it to the magnetical which covers the whole house. The feeding should be different and the emotion should be much easier.<br>凯史：因为这条线你能通过环境接收到巨大数量的宇宙能量，然后你将这个调低，而你连接到包裹整个房间的磁力场，供应也许不同而情感也会变得简单。<br>[]: Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Thank you.<br>：谢谢你。非常感谢你告诉我那些，谢谢你。<br>Mr. Keshe: We do this sometime, we connect your you have to connect you have to find a point to feed the gravitational if you connect gravitational to earth you are taking energy from the earth and if you don’t do and bring it back. Take it from the space and feed it to the house and then you see the difference.<br>凯史：有时我们做这些，我们连接你的你所连接到的，你已经发现了引力场供应点。如果你连接引力场到地球，你会获取能量来自于地球，假如你不这样做并带回它，拿到太空中，供养你的房子，你会看到这其中的不同。<br>[]; Thank you very much I had an idea that it’s just a massive collector that you comforted my thoughts.<br>：非常谢谢你。我有一个主意，那就是仅仅一个巨大的集电极，你能明白我的想法<br>Mr. Keshe: Use a chicken mesh it would be fantastic, I have done this because I can tell you this way, get yourself a zinc chicken mesh, in the wire the one called galvanised zinc chicken wire nano coated it and then connect your gravitational to this zinc mesh you will have a fantastic.<br>凯史：使用一块肌肉是不可思议的，我已经完成了这个，引文我能告诉你方法，给你自己一个锌的鸡肉，在一种线上我们称之为镀锌线鸡肉进行纳米覆盖，然后连接你的引力场到锌的肉上你会觉得异想天开。<br>[]; Ok, thank you very much<br>：好的，非常感谢你。</p>
<p>第六部分笔译  广安拈花一笑<br>Mr. Keshe: Thank you. Any other question or shall we call it a day? I have another thing we forgot to tell you one thing we promised you we are going to release this week, 10 Euro per magrav unit for Italian people and we will, and we release this tomorrow or Monday on this website, but there is further development with the communication with the bank which has to be added to by tomorrow we will see that they have made a huge move in the process of getting these it’s as fast as possible with Italian market. So if you are Italian hopefully, everything should be done on our side here on the website it’s called Italy.keshe foundation.org am I correct Samuel? You will find a code reference at the back reference we have already informed the bank.<br> 凯史：谢谢你！还有其他问题吗？要不今天就这样？我忘了告诉你们另一件事情，我们承诺本周要公布，磁引力单元对意大利人只要10欧元，我们明天或周一在网站上公布，我们和银行的沟通有进一步的拓展，银行已经确定明天添加，我们将看到他们已经为这个进程创造了巨大的进步，可以尽可能快地进入意大利市场。所以如果你是意大利人，一切都有望在我们这边的网站上来完成，网站是Italy.keshefoundation.org，塞缪尔我说对了吗？你会发现后面有一行引用代码，我们已经通知银行。</p>
<p>That there are what you call it rogue people call the bank call us terrorist and anybody else and we are waiting to call the bank recently. because we are looking for your numbers and you access and and your emails because your Italian police will take immediate action against you we are waiting for you and we informed you before and you don’t walk into a trap. Once we release the bank details please what you did with the other banks, call them this time we put you in the hand of the Italian police force and the Caribbean there are waiting for you.<br>你们称作流氓的那些人，打电话给银行说我们是恐怖分子或是别的什么人，我们最近正在等待银行，因为我们正在寻找你的号码和你的进入通道，还有你的邮箱，因为意大利警方将立即采取行动来反制，我们在等着你！在我们通知你之前请你不要自己走进陷阱。一旦我们公开银行资料，你与其他银行所做的，这一次你落到意大利警察手里，你就等着呆在加勒比吧。<br>On  the other hand please use the system wisely and we will deliver according to our Italian production manufacturing the system is at 10 Euro from a magrav system and its fro 120 instalments which is 10 Years and the system carries other pieces which is put in which is put in the bank and the transportation and the what you call, the taxes and you can still buy the units directly from the units if you want to pay for it and as of next week first of June we with draw the 300 contribution from the magrav systems so the magrav systems come to standard 499 and the structure stays the same you can go to the Italian bank give the reference code number it will be going to a setup of the company which we use here in Italy for the acceptance and the guarantee as usually within 90 days the system will be delivered.<br>另一方面请明智地使用这个系统，我们将公布，意大利生产制造的系统，每个系统是按120次分期付款10欧元，也就是10年付清，系统其他部分也交给银行，包括托运和税收，如果你想下周通过我们的抽签购买，你也可以直接付款购买磁引力单元，每个单元有300欧的捐赠，这样单元的标准价格是499欧元，单元结构是一样的，你可以去意大利银行索取代码，需要设置公司，我们用来在意大利接受担保，该单元通常在90天内交付。</p>
<p> we are more or less up to date with all our systems and I was told that it take somewhere the magrav unit what it takes somewhere has delivered 2 3 days it will be out so as of by the end of this month hopefully we have no back up, we have already have a backlog of units and anything which comes in it will be delivered on time within 90 days but we do it 5 because there is stock of materials we can meet the first 10 20000 immediately in the first 30 days’ time. The people who are working and they have been applying for the what we call the test with plasma with the gans please emails will go out to you this week please fill in the forms the agreements and get back to us it still done and within next 3 to 3 weeks we start hopefully releasing the materials to you and the way to use.<br>我们或多或少要对所有的系统进行更新，我被告知磁引力单元带到某处，已经递交了2至3天，在本月底前它不在这里，希望我们没有备份，我们已经有很多单元积压需要递送，它们都要在90天内按时交付，但因为材料库存，我们可以满足第一个月立即交付1至2万台。人们正在申请对等离子体对甘斯材料进行应用测试，请发邮件，将在本周回复你请你填写协议表单，然后返回到我们，在未来3周我们希望交付材料给你，进行应用测试。</p>
<p> We have slightly changed the structure because of the addition to the knowledge, some of the system like for the eye drop we have changed it in a different way and the one which is for the what you call it the skin we have to list in a different format so everything should be on its way once you receive you reference send it back to use you become part of the trial process. Any other question?<br>我们稍微改变了结构，因为知识增加了，一些系统如滴眼液，我们已经将它改变得不一样了，那种你们称着皮肤什么的我们不得不罗列不同格式，所以一切都走在它的路上。一旦你收到邮件，请你把表单发回我们，使你成为试验过程的一部分。还有其他问题吗?</p>
<p>Rick: Not seeing anything there is a question came with paid by credit card rather than a bank transfer.<br>瑞克：没看到有，有一个关于使用信用卡支付而不是银行转帐的问题。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: You will be, next 30 days yes, we closed our business with PayPal and we said in June we close all the activities in Belgium the reason for it is we tell you in advance then nation for the Belgium will not expect we will divide into the French and the Dutch so we advise that we move before the edge of the cosmos because we see the process coming up, it will be shocking to some of those who call themselves Belgian but the state of Belgium will not exist in a very short time because you will understand very very soon why we are moving out because they will not be a state called Belgium and without predicting we find out what is happing with the background and as of June we close every activity in Belgium and the new banking system will carry the carry credit card facilities and all the facilities which you need by card or the way guarantees you use and it will be again our Italian banking system and we be done most probably in china one day they will open they will same opportunity in china banks. Keshe foundation will support massive part of the program and we disclose it and we arrive.<br>凯史：你会，未来30天内，是的，我们关闭了我们通过PayPal支付的业务，我们说过6月份我们关闭所有比利时的活动，我们提前告诉你其中的原因，比利时作为一个国家将不复存在，我们将建议人们进入法国和荷兰，所以我们在宇宙缓慢移动前搬迁，因为我们看到的过程，这将震惊那些自称比利时的人们，很快比利时的国家将不复存在，因为你很快很快就会明白为什么我们搬出去，因为他们将不再有一个名叫比利时的国家，这不是预测，我们发现背后发生了什么，所以6月截止我们关闭比利时的所有活动，新的银行系统将携带信用卡设施，所有你需要的信用卡和担保业务的设施将在意大利银行再次启用，最大可能是中国将给我们同样的机会，有一天中国的银行也将向我们开放。凯史基金会将支持大规模项目，我们披露这方面我们已经实现了。<br>Rick: Ok thank you, Mr. Keshe I think<br>瑞克：好的，谢谢您，凯史先生！</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Let me explain to you why, because Euro and dollars are on a very loose foot and the Chinese currency is solid and this way we guarantee the support and save the nations we have collected their conduct. So we move a lot of our work into china. Carry on.<br>凯史：让我给你解释为什么，因为欧元和美元的基础非常松软，而中国人民币却稳固，这样我们救援那些国家就有了保证，我们收集了他们的表现，所以我们要把很多工作转移到中国。继续。</p>
<p>Rick: Ok is there anything else you would like to talk about Mr. Keshe? There is another question how do we get included in the trials and receive email for the application for the trial of the supplements I believe they have to just purchase the particular products first.<br>瑞克：Ok，凯史先生您还有什么想要再讲一些？还有另一个问题，我们如何得到试验，怎样才能收到关于应用试验供给相关的电子邮件，我认为他们必须先购买特定的产品。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: They just go on the trial you don’t have to purchase a product there is 60 120Euro for the trial is for creating information as I said in time they become part of the blueprint you can stand you see yourself but you are setting your structure to collect data for international application that we setup we don’t work like FDA during trials and covering up we have brought a lady some of you might know Sabrina has taken over to putting all the, test ee monials all the emails all the co respondence with all the health section. Sections for the doctors as soon as they is private for the doctors only as soon as there is test i monials and the communication for the gans trails will be  handled by Sabrina she is taking over from this week everything is setup for her by the web masters and you just sign in you fill in the form and agreement<br>凯史：只是继续试验，你不需要购买产品，有60-120欧元用于创建信息，我说过，过段时间这要成为蓝图的一部分，你可以基于自己的认识来设置你的系统，为我们构建的国际应用收集数据，我们不喜欢FDA在试验期间掩盖真相，我们的塞布丽娜女士，你们中的一些人可能认识，她已经投入到所有的测试工作，处理全球所有邮件，负责应答健康部分。部分医生只要他们是私人医生，只有世界范围内的测试和甘斯的通信试验将由塞布丽娜处理，她从本周接管一切，为她设置了网站主页，你只需要登入并填写你的表格和协议。</p>
<p>I filled in the agreement and people last night so it will go out of the this week once gain takes positions all the email will go from the banking side to there and you receive it you fill it in and you send it back once you receive it then the product are all there the services will be released to you from Tokyo. Most materials for the first 30 days will be made in Tokyo after that we go if I am correct we go from Italy so we are getting both side that we can supply either way if you are a Japanese  citizen and you leave in Japan hopeful you can get the full material supplements even we try to get you the water for decontamination of your lands and decontamination of the house where you contaminated with Fukushima, if you leave around Fukushima area in the zone where it was radioactive, heavy radioactive we contaminate it in next few week we release materials for this environment especially in what you call it in Japan.<br>昨晚人们填写了协议，会在本周内，一旦获得电子邮件地址，所有邮件将从银行系统发出，你收到它，然后你填写它，然后你发回来，一旦你收到它，然后产品的所有服务都由东京来发布。大多数材料将会在30天内在东京生产，如果我没错，之后我们从意大利去，我们两边都去，我们拱给，如果你是日本公民，你生活在日本，希望你可以得到完整的材料补给，甚至我们试着帮你用水去净化你那里受到福岛核污染的土地和房子，如果你居住在福岛周边严重的放射性影响区域，在未来几周我们为日本这种环境污染释放特别的材料。<br> As we speak now what the time now 11 o’clock tests have started in Tokyo, they started about 9 o’clock this morning and then once they are happy with the tests the results and everything else then in Tokyo in Japan you can started receiving the supplements with the confirmation with the radioactive materials in Fukushima directly public as a what you call as a substance it should be able to but it before you get the shelf in the next few weeks. But if you go to the website you can purchase and you will send application form it took us some time to get it legally sorted its done now and the we start it from this week, next week you start receiving the emails.<br>正如我们说，现在是11点钟，东京已经开始测试，他们今天早上大约9点开始，然后一旦他们对日本东京的测试结果满意，你就可以开始接收材料补给，这些材料对清除福岛的放射性物质是公认的，作为这样的物质你将能够让它发挥作用之前，在接下来的几周你要先购买它，如果你去网站上，你可以购买，你要发送申请表，我们花了一些时间来完成它的合法化，现在完成了，我们从这个星期开始，下周开始接收电子邮件。<br>Rick: Ok Mr. Keshe here is one that question maybe you can address which is request on how he mentions he has been experimenting in treating human waste, and he has a few samples and trying to achieve the vision. Given human waste and, can Mr. Keshe give me the info where to go forward with the, I think there has been some test results on E. coli testing for with the gans water.<br>瑞克：好的，凯史先生，这里有个问题，或许您可以，他请求他提到他一直尝试如何处理人类的排泄物，他有一些样品，而且试图实现这样的愿景，鉴于人类的排泄物，请凯史先生能给我进一步的启发，我认为有一些对大肠杆菌的测试结果，用甘斯水。<br>Mr. Keshe: I don’t understand can you explain<br>凯史：我没明白，请解释下。<br>Rick: Well he is explaining remaining with treating human waste and, I am assuming that E. coli might part of the testing that you want to do to try to redeem this E. coli.<br>瑞克：他说正在处理人类排泄物，比如其中一部分可能测试大肠杆菌，要做什么来转变大肠杆菌。<br>Mr. Keshe: We have is Benjamin;Benjamin is in the background. Benjamin are you there?<br>凯史：本杰明，本杰明在后台吗？本杰明在线吗？<br>Rick: Don’t see him in the. He is around he could put his hand up to make him recognise you as viewer.<br>瑞克：没见到，他大约，他举手就能在窗口中认出他来。<br>Mr. Keshe We could be, Fabio could you please, sorry can you bring my computer back from the office this data we receive yesterday from atomic energy with the water section with the Ghanaian atomic energy of Ghana, because it’s important how it works where there some more and unless it’s going on and with it the water E.coli effectively can be reduced or totally take out by use of CO2 or copper oxide liquid plasma, now we have the data ,because what they did, the authorities in Ghana it’s a huge problem because a lot of people do everything in the rivers, they kill the animals they clean themselves and everything else.<br>凯史：我们可以，法比奥，请你从办公室把我的电脑拿过来，我们昨天从加纳原子能机构的水处理部门收到这些数据，因为很重要，他们那里怎样做到的，除非发生了什么，大肠杆菌有效减少或者完全排除，使用CO2或氧化铜液态等离子体，现在我们有数据，因为他们所做的，这是加纳当局的一个巨大的难题，因为很多人每件事都离不开那条河，他们宰杀动物，他们清洁自己以及各种。<br> and they did the test with this E.coli ,and I have seen the test yesterday, we have received a lot of information according to Ghana ,but we go and lot at, we have seen the work of the technology ,it’s a very easy way the cheapest way which has no cost for changing the course, they will be releasing next week, we have one online, they have produces the first soaps which can eliminate all bacteria its better than any detergent, they have seen and it’s a way, they have been working on it, and they have developed it and they read it to you.<br>他们对大肠杆菌做了测试，昨天我见过测试结果，我们已经收到很多加纳相关的信息，但是我们去那里利用这些材料和技术来处理，这是一种非常简单非常便宜的方法，改变处理方式但不花成本，他们将在下周发布，他们有一位在线，他们已经首次生产出肥皂，可以清除所有的细菌，比任何洗涤剂都有效，他们清楚这是一个好办法，他们已经开始从事这件事，已经开始研发。把他们的情况读给你们听：<br>The views often river E. coli on the low without a treatment was brought to 0 from 46. Raw was 7 treated change 2. Brim raw was 19 brought to 8. Shamus was 19 brought to 1. And Ghana standard and international standard is 0 .so you have seen literally except one case which we want to know why Brim is gone to less than half but doesn’t go to 0 ,what I the content of the river. Which we might have to add more gans liquid water plasma liquid and the Co2 or copper oxide to be able to bring that thing to 0 so hopefully the water research institute the couple of scienctist that your research in Ghana and you just this research here you sing and seal by the head of the department and it official test result we received it so it is backed by Ghana atomic energy council, so we know this will be used in the coming time in next few week.<br>基本上认为河流的大肠杆菌在低水平上没采取其它措施，它的指标从46降到0，原菌处理后从7降到2，边缘的原菌从19降到8，Shamus 从19降到1，加纳标准和国际标准是0，所以从字面上看，除了一个案例，我们想知道为什么边缘降到一半以下，但达不到0，这条河里面的这些容物。所以我们可能需要添加更多的等离子体液体甘斯水，二氧化碳或氧化铜能够把这些物质降到0。所以我们对研究机构的几位水质科学家充满希望，你们在加纳的研究将引导一些部门，我们收到官方的测试结果，它的背景是加纳原子能委员会，所以我们知道这将在未来几个星期投入应用。<br>I have set up a process that will test up in china its very effective in cleaning it rivers the problem with it is that you create a condition that we can get rid of the E.coli but we do not endanger the life of the other life in the river. This is important we have to find the balance and what you want to use for human waste the gans of CO2 and copper oxide works but with the for the total elimination of the what we call the E.coli from Sierra Leone university Ebola with the gans water totally annihilated it does notexist it just not exist it just drains the energy but of the plasma of the protein.<br>我们已经建立了一个项目，将在中国进行测试，非常有效地清理中国河流的问题，由你们来创建一种条件，可以摆脱大肠杆菌，但是不会危及河流中的其它生命。这很重要，我们必须找到平衡点，你想用CO2和氧化铜甘斯来处理人类排泄物，塞拉利昂综合大学，利用甘斯水完全消灭埃博拉病毒，它已经不存在了，只是消耗掉了病毒蛋白质的等离子体的能量。<br>so we see the application and we can see how things can develop and by going to the methodical of measure weight and by millilitre per sample so by changing the sample from more gans of copper oxide you can illuminate all the bacteria any bacteria in a clean process but you have to consider if you use it a s source for the in the rivers you have to reconsider the position that we create a life condition that the energy balance between the copper oxide allow the life and the existence of the other animals in the river.<br>所以我们看到的应用，可以采用样本指标权重的方法，通过改变氧化铜甘斯的剂量来检测每毫升样本的指标变化，清除所有的细菌，但你必须考虑你的剂量定位水平，我们必须考虑创建满足生命存活的能量平衡，确保生活在河中的其他生物能够生存。<br>So what we are looking is a combination of CH3 CO2 zinc oxide and small amount of coper oxide so we know it reduces to a limit of safe but it does not destroy by adding you understanding the process you add CH3 to the river to allow life. But on the other hand you take energy from what it above carbon which is the plasma of the virus. When we said we are on its way so we try to keep in connection with human life with the marine life<br>所以我们看到一个CH3、 CO2、氧化锌和少量的氧化铜的组合，我们知道它降低了安全限值，但不破坏生命，随着你对过程的理解，你添加CH3允许河中的生命存活，但另一方面，你取走病毒等离子体能量，其水平超过碳的水平，我们说过，我们采用适应生命的方式，所以我们试图保持人类生命与海洋生命的联系。<br>but anything above it we take over the copper oxide so you don’t endanger life if you use any copper oxide gans for the liquid plasma you take all the energy out this way with the balance field as you are using a single plasma everything will come together. you have to start thinking universal not to just achieve one you have to see what are the other side effects from the other conditions. it creates and see how it can be put together.<br>但在它之上的所有物质材料，我们借用氧化铜，你不危及生命，如果你使用任何氧化铜甘斯的液体等离子体，你取得各种能量的平衡场，这样，与你使用各种材料的单一的等离子体都会走到一起。你必须开始普遍思考，而不是仅仅是达到一方面的目的，而另一方面你必须看到在其他情况下产生的副作用，它创造什么后果，还要看到它怎样可以组合在一起。<br>You got when you deal with the environmental conditions you have to understand we don’t go just to achieve what you want to achieve because this way to get rid of something you destroy the others. You look what are the parameters what are involved what are the animals which are involved in the whole thing, you support the whole circulation which is not good for you but you still allow life to exist. If you understand the totality of you have even, we taught earlier on today this is very important I was expecting this yesterday on the table to Giovanni. I have got to find it and then we see it exactly where we go then we go back to it. I don’t know where it was but let’s go I will find it because it’s important.You understand what I am taking about in a minute. There it is.<br>当你处理环境问题时，你必须明白我们不只是去实现想要实现的目的，这样会导致你摆脱某些事情同时又在破坏别的事情。你看看参数是多少，涉及什么动物，什么东西参与整个事情，你支持整个循环，对你来说不是最佳选项，但你却保存了那些生命。如果你理解今天早前我们所讲授的全部，这是非常重要的，我期待这样，昨天我对乔凡尼说。我们要找一下，看看在白板哪个位置了，我们回到刚才，我不知道它哪个位置，找一下，这个很重要，你知道，几分钟前，在这里。<br>You see this is a virus at the moment a threat, but you take its energy from it as a virus see what you got in your hand. You have amino acid this is a food; this is how the situation changes you change a virus a dangerous position by using the appropriate gas transfer of energy to life giving thing this is what we done in the in Tokyo we use radioactive material to create gold which you saw in the presentation. You don’t destroy anything with this new technology. You find out how by creating a condition you the normality what it bring more on the table. Your here you have bacteria you have the virus; you take the energy from it inside his seed a vast amount of energy. It itself is food you created expensive much time to create this in conjunction with the right way you create new life in the water.<br>此刻你看到这是病毒威胁，但是你利用病毒的能量，看看你手里，那都是氨基酸，是食物，这一情况的转化，就是如何利用气体的合适状态来改变病毒的危险状况，使它的能量转换成为给予生命的东西，我们在东京就是这样使用放射性物质创造黄金，在展示中你看见过。这项新技术不破坏任何事物。你通过创建条件，在常态下给桌面上带来更多的东西。这些细菌、病毒，你从它的生命内核里取得大量的能量，它就是你创造的食物，你花费昂贵的时间去构建协调，运用正确的方法，你在水里就能创造出新生命。<br>Not everything it’s just understanding how to use to your unto chance what the real behind. There are a lot of viruses which are connected to the amino of what you call of the human being can be taken away and then that amino acid is a huge last amount of energy the way ??? it’s like eating a beef but this time the energy inside could be much more because don’t forget by being connected to the virus the amino acid has received new record of energy its fully charged. Don’t look at always getting rid of see that is left what brings as a gift.<br>不只要理解每件事情怎样为我所用，要抓住真相背后的机会，很多病毒与人类氨基酸有连接，这些氨基酸可以剥离出来成为巨大的能量来源，堪比吃牛肉，但是这次，这里面的能量可能会更多，因为别忘了通过连接病毒的氨基酸，它已经完全充能，不要总看到你摆脱什么，还要看到剩下的东西带给我们什么样的馈赠。<br>In this animation plants there is processing plants in environmental cleaning plant always looks what it keeps you not what it destroys what you are happy with because if you can see what it gives you then you can use it that you pass you set the path in a very peaceful way that coexistence stays for everything but what it means benefit you at that time. In environmental polluting when you clean you really want to clean the air you create gravitational magnetic field of the nano material of the environment which you want to clear and what I s left with what can you do with what is left it’s a lot of assets its lot of materials which you can use for a lot of thing if you understand what is it.<br>这些充满生机的植物，它们正在处理环境，保持你不被消灭，因为它们你有多幸福，你可以看到它们给予你的，然后你可以使用它通过你们设置的路径，以非常和平的方式与万物共处，意味着那样做就带给你们益处。你们清理环境污染，你真的想清洁空气，你利用能够清洁环境的纳米材料创建磁引力场，伴随着对环境的处理，剩下些什么呢？是大量的宝贵资产，大量的材料，你可以在很多场合用到它们，如果你理解这一切的话。<br>Come out of the mind set of destroying or getting rid of and come into the mind-set of what benefit does it bring me and the humanity how can I used the new condition to benefit to have benefit of it to the advantage of us when you find out you think totally when you find you thing totally different you see the operation of the gans and the plasma totally different way than just trying to destroying as is been the pattern. Any other question?<br>走出破坏或摆脱的心态，来到这样的思维模式：这件事情能带给我们人类什么益处，人类如何使用新的技术条件带来效益和优势，当你找到整体的思考方式，完全不同的思考方式，完全不同的甘斯和等离子体的处理方式，好过只是试图破坏的模式。<br>还有其他问题吗?<br>Rick: We have one here Mr. Keshe, its actually from sandy I am not sure why she is a bit shy but.<br>瑞克：我们这里有一位，Keshe先生，其实我不确信桑迪为什么她有点害羞，但……<br>Mr. Keshe: Sandy being shy.<br>凯史：桑迪害羞。</p>
<p>Rick: Hard to believe but she is asking please describe a situation which you see the universal council will be involved I, how do you see the universal council working.<br>瑞克：很难相信，但她请求描述一下您看到的，涉及环球委员会，您怎么看环球委员会的工作。<br>Mr. Keshe: As she is the secretary general she can answer it herself. I am a foot soldier.<br>凯史：她是秘书将军，她能够回答自己，我只不过是步兵。</p>
<p>Rick: When we are seeing working is in sub groups in Facebook to adjust different people concerns like…<br>瑞克：我们看到的工作是小组在脸谱网调整不同人群的关注度。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:This is the Facebook sub groups are setup by Caroline, Caroline being the head of the council she set up the universal council it’s in bracket sign KFSSI and because there is so much coming in, they start dividing it into the sections which anyone can divide and anybody can take part in coming with positive ideas to solve different problems, now I heard they’re talking about a veterinarian it’s for the animals we have seen doctor and you’er having that dog we have doctors but we have not vets to look at the interest of the animals so now they set veterinary they set up one for the doctors people can come in the work of the council is to progress to ears the peaceful application for the technology, and bringing peace and a number of council members who are there understood working that direction so that they down that their job is not to look what the job or how we can fight this to get what we want the council members will work in the direction of this side in the alternative way which harms no one.<br>凯史：脸谱网上的小组由卡洛琳设置，卡洛琳是委员会的负责人，她设置了环球委员会的支架上的标志KSFFI。因为参与的人多，他们开始对参与者进行分类，任何人都要归类，任何人都可以参与，这些人带着解决不同问题的积极意见。现在我听到他们正在谈论动物医生，我们看到这里有医生，你们有狗狗，但这些兽医对照顾动物不感兴趣，所以现在设立兽医，兽医可以个人进入委员会，参与这项技术的和平应用进程，带来和平。一些委员理解工作方向，确保他们的工作，委员的工作是以不伤害任何人的方式开展。<br>This is a way the way the council will work we work on a plan or direction that we look that positive peaceful application of the technology. As I said before we can bring a lot of ways and knowledge in not fighting but bringing solution and then when you bring solution don’t fight because you don’t bring solutions you have to be our way, you bring a solution and it’s for the souls to accept the work of the solution ,this is the way it happens to be, we put wrongs of the table what we the solution of right but not blaming for what’s gone wrong.<br>凯史：这是委员会的工作方式，在它计划或方向上，我们看到的积极的和平的应用技术。我之前说过，我们可以带来很多方面的知识，没有战争，只带来解决方案，然后带来的解决方案，没有战争，因为你们的解决方案必须服从这个没有战争的方式，那是你的灵魂接受的解决方案，这些正在实现。我们把错误和正确的解决方案都摆在台面上来，但对错误的造成不加指责。<br>Rick:Mr. Keshe may I read the first rule to be the member of the universal council that I believe you put in message please. I say the universal council member should shine like the light of the creator to be source of light or the soul sun radiate the light of the beauty of the creator and have and try to reach all attributes of the score of the creator in time creatures of the universe see this light and into the physicality of the man. The attribute of the creator has been stated in many scriptures of the man the past.<br>瑞克：凯史先生，我可以读环球委员会的第一条规则吗？我认为是您放上去的。规则说：环球委员会的成员将会像造物主源头一样闪耀，像阳光映射焕发出造物的美丽，在时间流逝中，试着体现宇宙造物的自然本性，能够看见造物的光茫进入人类的身体。在人类已存的许多经文中，造物主的本性已经被阐明过。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: I Think that answer the totality of it this is the rule and the conditions and may be this is the rule of the humanity as a whole but we wait and see in time in which. You would like to read the 2nd?<br>凯史：我认为这就是答案，这是全部的规则和条件，也许这是人类成为一体的规则，我们等等看吧。你想读第二条吗?</p>
<p>Rick: OK its says secondly you are through your soul a member of the council. Shall I continue?<br>瑞克：好的，第二条规则说，通过你们委员会成员的灵魂，我可以继续吗？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: yes<br>凯史：继续。</p>
<p>Rick: The members of the council who can’t announce themselves as a member of a council unless it is announced and register under the council’s panels and no members of the council can ever speak as themselves be a made in influencing their opinion on word is quite immediately lose their seat in the council and the new member can stand do the position those who try to show that they are better servants of humanity they do stand a chance to take seat in the council, that’s an interesting one. Those who try to show that they are better servant of humanity why do not stand a chance to take a seat in the council. So goes no selection of the soul of the council comes from service to giving from the soul and not by talk or physical actions. That’s the end of that transmission.<br>瑞克：不可以自己宣布自己成为委员会的成员，除非在委员会版面上公示和注册，委员会成员不能拿委员的说词施加影响，这样你会立即失去你在委员会的席位，新成员可以站在证明自己是人类的更优秀的公仆的立场上来做事，人们也可以借由这样的机会来坐到委员会的席位上去。这一条很有趣。那些试图表明他们是更优秀的人，为什么不给他们机会坐到委员会去呢？所以，这是没有选择的，委员会的灵魂来自于“服务和给予”，而不是靠嘴皮子或搞活动。这是结尾。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: The process is very simple a lot of people who were in Dubai and they announce themselves they want to be a council and they went out to use it to dictate and immediate they lost their seat and we are looking if you are we speaking language we will be announced by before September the language we have filled in as member of the councils and if you are nature of the soul of serving humanity you can come to the law meeting and stand of the language the mother language not the language you spoke but the mother language which you speak before the members of that community and when its filled up but there is place for the under sign. If for you to work for the same soul for the existing council to explain the work of the language so you don’t take the way there is some body else, you know them you add to the totality to streng then and spread the what you call the peaceful application for the technology with governments with the institute with teaching and in that process we go very far.<br>凯史：这个过程是非常简单，在迪拜很多人宣布自己想成为委员会成员，当他们离开，用这个身份来行使主宰，那他就立即失去了他的委员资格。我们要看看，我们将在9月之前宣布，用我们填写委员申请的语言来宣布，如果你的想法是来自灵魂服务人类的自然流露，你可以来到法律会议上，使用你的母语，而不是你在社区会议接待表上填写的语言，为了同一个灵魂，为了委员会现实的工作需要，进行工作说明的语言，你不要采用别人的方式，你知道，你的加入使整体更强大，传播和平的应用技术，与太空船学院一起，联络政府，结合教学，以这样的过程，我们走得很远。</p>
<p>•  Couple government have already understood and you understand the process and we are in that path of weaking very raging this if of the technology and you will that this figures will stand as member of council themselves because they change course of humanity as a position they have and they have done it, you have seen this with one world leader in the past and I have mentioned it before. Gorbachev is the only world leader in the past which put the nation, the soul of his nation the head of his position and head of the USSR he submitted his nation his soul. It will take a lot of man to do that it need a lot of freedom of physicality to get such a position of the most powerful man in the world for the nation to have its freedom and it’s still among us he is sick but he still among us. Any other question?<br>有几个政府已经理解，你们明白这个过程，这条道路充满艰辛，如果这个技术，这个数量取决于委员会成员，因为你们自己在改变人类的方向，这些已经做到，你们已经看到一个世界领导，这个过去我提到过，戈尔巴乔夫是过去唯一的世界领导，推动他所在地区的民族，他是前苏联地区的灵魂人物，他把自己的灵魂交给他的国家，这需要大量的人去做事，需要很多的自由生命体在强权地区达成他们的自由，他现在生病了，但他仍在我们中间。有其他问题吗？</p>
<p>[ sandy]: Mr. Keshe, I am not being bit shy now so, the people interested in becoming a one of council they. Do they have to go to Rome or can they just submits an invention?<br>桑迪：凯史先生，我现在不害羞了，人们感兴趣变成一个国家，他们必须去罗马还是可以提交一个创意？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe; We are trying I looked at this is have seen your email and we can organise for people who can not be there for whatever reason they don’t want to be there we open a zoom channel onto the conference event eh member of the council we allow them to attend it ，if they want ，if you see your county base when you are on planet Zeus trailing in space you can’t be in the council but you are there will the soul we allow people to put their name very soon once we set the structure one we be the member of the language and you will be given what we call zoom link with other member of the council or you can attend or set up your own native language or in your own mother tongue and you will be announced or the people can come to you or you can go to the people to encourage to delve the process of the piece and when you are creating you are coming to a positon that financially the foundation through different structures can support not a peace movement but delivery of the tools of peace in the coming week in the coming weeks you will see what we mean with this.<br>凯史：我们正在研究，我们看到了你的邮件，我们可以为那些不论出于何种原因而不能到场的人们，在ZOOM上开通一个会议活动专用频道，允许委员会成员通过频道参加会议，如果他愿意的话，当然还要取决于你们国家的[网络]基础条件。如果你在宙斯行星上旅行，在太空中你不能出席委员会，但你有灵魂，我们设置你的名字，很快的，一旦我们那个装置设定为委员的语言，你就有了我们自己的 zoom链接，通过它与其他委员会成员联络，或者你可以参加会议，以你们国家的语言或你们家乡的土话，然后公布出去，人们可以连接你，你也可以鼓励在进程中的人们钻研和平技术。当你创建起你的最终位置，基金会通过不同的装置来支持你，不通过空间运动就向你传递和平工具，在接下来的一周，在未来的几周你会明白我说什么。</p>
<p>There is, were still for a council from people language,if you are of Jewish decent you speak fluent Hebrew join the council because there is lot you can do with us with the muslin Arab member so the council the development of the peace in degrees. I know we have a large numbers of Jewish listeners in the background. If you see your soul with the chimp to be  able to use a technology to bring peace you don’t need to come to conference you seen you open your channel you know where it is we explain yourself to be the if you are speaking member of the council and then we have a lot to talk about the same goes with other culture and other languages it will be very difficult for a lot of council member from Africa to attend the meeting because the situation getting Visa begin there, you can represent yourselves you can nominate yourselves as a member of the council you are onto the same facility as English or French speaking member of the council and we support you where you are and we can communicate with the other but understand we are on position being a member of the council from any African language or America or English or Chinese does not give no of them or you any superiority we are all equal .<br>根据委员的语言，如果你是正宗犹太人，说一口流利的希伯来语来参加委员会，因为人多，你们可以和我们和阿拉伯穆斯林一起来解决，这样以多角度来和平发展。我知道背景中有大量的犹太听众。如果你清楚你的灵魂和黑猩猩能够利用技术带来和平，你不需要来参加会议。你看到了你打开频道，我们解释过，如果你向委员会成员说话，同时我们还有很多文化背景的人以不同的语言同样在谈论，非洲地区的许多成员来参加会议就变得非常困难，这种局势从得到签证开始。你可以代表自己，可以推荐自己作为委员会的一员，你使用讲英语或法语的委员一样的设施，我们支持你所在的地点，我们可以与其它人通信，但理解我们站在委员会成员的立场，无论非洲语言、美语、英语或汉语，都没有任何优势，我们都是平等的。<br>because you worked for your soul and not through the state of the foundation which has been the cause of all the problems so we need we will announce in time now we have 2 full time members in the background area in the back and sandy as that I call the head of keshe foundation organisation on the universal council and we add to these are go along as is need they are call ablate to do you to give all the facilities we proved for all the people who want to the member of the council we ask the ask the council in next 30 days 60 days,when it’s all settled if you were in Bubai and you still to be a member of the council and still of same ethos we have been sent an email in the past 7 days respond to the email and the process starts. 3 people who stood have already been themselves as stood themselves down by their behave our as we seen on the internet and what we see we check number of thing and we don’t look for what is in the background we check how you behave from the day you become or stood to become member of the council if it’s just to be there or is there to serve,and we have seen 2 German speaking Spanish they have been we don’t by the council we will not accept their position and one has been from Norway.<br>因为你为你的灵魂做事，而不是通过基金会所有问题的状态，所以一定时候我们将宣布我们后台背景有2个全职成员，桑迪，我称她为凯史基金会环球委员会组织的领头，我们增加这些都是根据需要来的，给你们所有的设施条件，让你们证明你们想成为委员会的成员，我们要求委员会在未来30天到60天做这些事，如果你还在迪拜，仍然是委员会的成员，同样的社区理念没变，我们在过去7天已经发给你一封应答邮件，这个过程就算开始了。有3个人已经用行为表达了他们的立场，我们在互联网上看到，我们检查做了多少事情，我们不在后台寻求什么，从你成为委员会成员那天开始我们验证你如何表现，你在那里的服务，我们看到两位说西班牙语的德国人，他们已经被委员检验过了，我们不会接受他们的立场。另一位来自挪威。</p>
<p>Rick: We do have someone one on live stream who has been around Abby, Biskey she is saying she will be in Rome she speaks Hebrew. And she invites Israelis now. She is Jewishand she should like to do fluent in Hebrew.<br>瑞克：我们有一位live-stream教学节目上的学员，住在艾比附近，她说她要来罗马，她讲希伯来语，她现在邀请以色列人，她是犹太人，她的希伯来语非常流利。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Contact the council. Universal council has its own website its own link and in a way I can’t tell you. It works as you want it works if the message is peace. If you listen shalom, Salma its all the same meaning.<br>凯史：请她联络委员会。环球委员会有自己的网站和自己的链接，只是我不能告诉你。它的工作就是你的意愿，如果你的讯息是和平的话。如同你听沙龙-萨尔玛，一样有意义。</p>
<p>Rick: She is asking what link would be the way to get in touch.<br>瑞克：她在问用什么样的联系方式来接触？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Sandy you are there.<br>凯史：桑迪在线上。</p>
<p>Sandy: <a href="mailto:Sandy@spaceshipinstitue.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandy@spaceshipinstitue.org</a><br>桑迪： 联络邮箱：<a href="mailto:Sandy@spaceshipinstitue.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandy@spaceshipinstitue.org</a></p>
<p>Rick: Ok I hope that doesn’t create too much of a flood of emails but just the right amount<br>瑞克：好吧，我希望不会收到过多的垃圾邮件，只要正确的那些。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Its good it’s for them not for us she can read them. We get enough if it keeps her busy for a while. Any other question? You support the kind you don’t need to be a member of the council to support the council work we work all as a treat, your respectable position and time, that is as to be postie any negativity we will not be responding to. Find a position where we do not interfere with the work of the physicality but we interact and elevate the soul of the man in any shape of or form.<br>凯史：这都很好，这是为他们不是为我们，她可以读到这些。我们收到足够的邮件，够她忙一段时间。还有其他问题吗?<br>你支持委员会的工作，但你不需要成为委员会的成员，我们都为了奖赏而工作，你的受人尊敬的地位和时间，任何消极的邮件，我们不会回应。找到一个不妨碍物理身体的位置来开展工作，但是我们与灵魂互动，并提升人类的灵魂，以任何形式。</p>
<p> In Hebrew there is a word and that word has been taken out of the language in Arabic it’s the same word but it has to be taken out of the language when you become member of the council the Arabic we call it Ajab and in Hebrew we call it Kweb which mean a non-believer. So in being peace we come to a point to understand that the work of the council is the unification of the soul of the man. Thank you very much for today we finish at 12 o’clock we have some more in the background. Is there any more questions or we call it a day?<br>在希伯来语中有一个词，这个词在阿拉伯语中被去除，虽然是同一个词汇但它必须在另一种语言中去除，当你成为委员会成员，用阿拉伯语我们称之为Ajab，用希伯来语我们称之为Kweb，意思是“非信徒”。所以我们来到一个对和平的理解的点，委员会的工作是人类灵魂的统一。<br>非常感谢大家，今天我们12点钟结束，我们有很多后台的事情。还有其它问题吗，或者今天就这样？</p>
<p>Rick: the only other thing is Brad mentions a couple of email addresses in he wants to ask you if he can announce for the universal council, the keshefoundation email address well is actually a .keshe.<br>瑞克：唯一的另一件事是布拉德提到几封电子邮件地址，他想问您，他能否公布环球委员会或凯史基金会的电子邮件地址，实际上都是一个。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: You are the web master why should I do it? AS you know we have 2 web masters Stanley and Vince and their got her hands full with their own bits and its getting. We need we are look at couple of Chinese web masters in the coming time while we are in china and to amalgamate the work of the foundation as one team.<br>凯史：你们是站长，为什么要我来做主呢？你们知道，我们有两个网站站长，斯坦利和文斯，他们手把手一点一点建起来的。接下来，当我们在中国的时候，我们需要研究中国网站站长，要让基金会合并为一个团队。</p>
<p>Rick: I can put up the screen share of the.<br>瑞克：我可以分享在屏幕上。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:Would you like to announce to for the ones who listen?<br>凯史：可以给听众公布吗？</p>
<p>Brad:  Yeah I went out I got my microphone here so its niversalcouncil.keshefoudaiton.org<br>布拉德:是的，我放下麦克风，网址是：universalcouncil.keshefoudaiton.org</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: but universal council has its own .org website too am I correct or hasn’t been set up yet. Ok universals council has its own webmaster which is Ali in time they will give you all the access to it. Pardon?<br>凯史：但环球委员会也有它自己的 .org 网站，我说对了吗？，或者尚未建好。OK，环球委员会有自己的站长，阿里会给你们访问通道。<br>什么没听清？</p>
