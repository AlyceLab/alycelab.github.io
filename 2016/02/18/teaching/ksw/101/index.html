<p>Welcome everyone to the 101st Keshe knowledge seekers workshop is Thursday February 2016 and once again we are ready to go with another show here with activities of the Keshe foundation this is the agricultural blueprint teaching today I will have a number of presentations from different agricultural aspects from around the world and I think Mr. Keshe is ready to go but we are going to play this video first one world one race video and then we will have a word from Mr. Keshe after that. Okay here we go.<br>瑞克：欢迎来到101次凯史知识寻求者课堂，今天是星期四，2016年2月18号，我们再一次准备凯史基金会的教学，今天是农业蓝图教学，我们有来自世界各地的关于农业各个方面的大量的展示，我认为凯史先生准备开始了，但我们还是先播放一下一个世界一个种族的视屏，然后再有请凯史先生讲话。好，我们开始。<br>{Intro video} There are people listening from every corner of this planet no knowledge has been spread so beautifully or balanced across the planet ever maybe in the universe you have the full potential of achieving everything in the universe there is no need and there no for man not to achieve so wherever you are the way I taught you make the coils that we design we have continue equal gravitational magnetic field and if you put CO2 and you put zinc on it you have connected the emotion of the man on the stable condition find out you have a very peaceful man. Here we stop having galaxies and the universe goes and creation in magnetical we have used the matter state gravitational magnetic field strength to dominate and dictate the shape of the plasma. The nano technology the nano material which you have collectively developed in different ways by caustic by electric current by whatever fire or whatever has that advantage that the matter the nano is all the same so connection solid it’s very strong. The power of the plasma technology the way we have taught is beyond imagination of the man. Now we create and control the plasma which is the mother of the creation of the universe we are given the seed of the essence of creation. The foundation does not belong to no one and is not made of one anymore. You are developing it you are a structure in it and from today it will be still the same we will still develop the technology in different lanes in different colours in different nationalities in which they do not exist. It is beautiful when we see a Christian a Muslim the Jew and every other belief are working together to build up systems we have already become on faith, we have already have become one nation and we already have become one planet.  We got to remember one thing dates is irrelevant today is the last day of the Christian calendar or tomorrow is the beginning of another, one dates connect to another we don’t stop. We are working around the clock Keshe foundation team is working a respectable time position religion country, and now we keep up the setup. {End of intro video}<br>凯：这个星球的每个角落都有人在听我们授课，知识从来没有像现在这样以如此美妙与平衡的方式在这个星球上传播。在宇宙中你有实现任何事情的全部的潜能，人类完全可以自由实现自己所需，所以无论你在哪里，我教你们制作线圈的方式，我们设计的双线圈的方式，你就能制造平衡的磁引力场，如果你CO2放在上面，把锌片放在上面，你就能与人类的情感相连接，你会发现成为一个很和平的人。现在我们知晓星系与宇宙的运行，在磁力中创造与连接，我们可以使用物质状态下的磁引力场强度来支配与控制等离子体的状态。你们一起以不同的方式在发展这个纳米技术，这个纳米材料，通过烧碱，通过电流，通过火或者其他。这样的优势就是纳米、物质、等离子体之间成为一体，相互的连接是如此坚固，如此强大。我们所教授的等离子体技术展现的力量超出人们的想象。现在我们能创造和控制作为创造宇宙的等离子体，我们被给予了创造元素的种子。基金会不隶属于任何人，不再是由一人组成。你们发展它，你成为结构中的一部分，从今天开始我们能成为一样的，我们仍会在不同的名字、不同的颜色、不同的国度的条件下发展这个技术，但这些都不会存在。这是很美妙的，当我们看见一个穆斯林，一个基督徒，一个犹太人在一起工作，一起建造这个系统，我们已经变得有了同一个信仰，我们已经成为一个国家，我们已经成为一个星球。我们要记住，日期是不相关的，今天是基督教历的最后一天，明天又是另一个开始，一天连着一天，我们不会停止。我们在一起工作，凯史基金会团队是在各自合适的时间，地点，宗教与国家中工作。现在我们实现了我们所设置的目标。<br>[Rick]: Okay that’s such a lovely video, I think we are for Mr. Keshe now Mr. Keshe now are you ready to speak I think we are going to show promotional video as well after that.<br>瑞克：好了，这是一个很让人愉快的视屏。我认为现在可以有请凯史先生讲话了，你准备好了吗，凯史先生，过后，我认为还要再放一个宣传视屏。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes good morning, good day o you as usual wherever, whenever you listen to these knowledge seeker program s as we one the blueprint for the energy we open the blueprint for health today we try to open a blueprint in a way most of you know. For health agriculture and decontamination and in the coming time we announce the final phase of the blueprint and I’ll be the spaceship program for lift and take-off. We started the beginning the first blueprint in the 16th of November or 26th of November on the back of giving the technology to the governments and with it most of the presentation. The 2nd presentation which was the health was one partially between the foundation and the members of the foundation around the world.<br>凯：是的，早上好。无论你们何时何地收听这次知识者寻求节目，像往常一样祝你们日安！我们释放了能量蓝图，我们释放了医疗蓝图，今天我们也要释放一个蓝图，你们大部分人应该知道—农业与净化蓝图，在未来我们会宣布蓝图的最后阶段，我会参与到太空飞船的提升与起飞的项目中。我们在给政府释放大部分技术后，紧接着就在11月26日释放了第一次蓝图，第二阶段的健康蓝图有一部分是在基金会以及与世界各地的基金会成员之间展开的。<br>Today we will see the members of the Keshe foundation around the world will show most of the agriculture and decontamination and we add to it. And when we show the lift you will see a full structure of the spaceship you will develop a full lift then it will be done by the people not by the foundation, we will announce the date of it I will guide the teams who are working the background in that direction to be ready for the final show, which will not disclose the time and the place but it will be shown when we decided then we show you how you build it that you all can do it so today’s teaching is on an international basis of the blueprint or decontamination we will see some of the result which has come different parts of the world for decontamination and agriculture and then we will answer some question the most important thing at the moment around the foundation is one as they why we come to Dubai and all the rumours which is started in the background as we escape from Italy as was mention in the interview I gave to Carrie Cassidy this morning.<br>凯：今天我们会看见世界各地的凯史基金会成员展示大部分关于农业与净化的内容，然后我们也会增加知识。当我们展示飞升时，你们会看见飞船完整的结构，你们会发展出一种完全的飞升，这将由你们而不是基金会来实现。我们会宣布那一天的日子，我会指导一直在幕后从事这方面工作的团队，从而做好最后展示的准备，这次最后的展示不会公布时间与地点，但当我们决定要展示的时候我们就会展示，没有蓝图，然后你们展示如何建造它，你们都能够做到。所以今天的教学是具有国际基础的蓝图-净化教学，我们会看见来自世界不同地方的关于农业与净化方面的不同测试结果，然后我们会回答一些问题，目前围绕在凯史基金会周围的一个很重要的问题是，他们问道我们为什么要去迪拜，关于我们逃离 意大利有很多流言蜚语出现，这些在今天早上我接受卡西迪卡丽的采访中被提到。<br>We haven’t escaped from Italy we have a fantastic in Italy we still based in Italy we opening another base in Middle East, Dubai will be the base of middle as Italy is the base for Europe. So those who talk about these things are those who are well paid to do these things to distract and in that level we do not really consider these people because they want buy another upper floor maybe the 15th floor of the same building and in so many ways we are here to serve humanity through human race no here to be an whatever go around with people who serve themselves and their pockets.<br>凯：我们没有逃离意大利，我们在意大利度过一段很美好的时光，我们仍然根基于意大利，现在只是在中东开设了一个基地，迪拜是中东的基地就如同意大利是欧洲的基地。所以那些谈论这些事情的人都是些被支付报酬的人，他们想要分散注意力，实际上我们也并不在意这些人，因为他们想要购买一个更高一层的房间，或许是同一栋建筑里的第15层。他们只是在做他们的工作。我们在这里是以各种方式通过人类来服务于人类，而不是在与那些自私自利的人打交道做买卖。<br> Today’s most important project is Dubai, is to make Dubai the city of the spaceship city to make Dubai the city of peace and to make it the city the new structure of the governing of the Keshe foundation what we call universal community. In the Dubai conference we ask you to bring as much technologies you developed around using the same technology with you and we give you the facility to show you to demonstrate to it and we stand we next elect the next generation of what we call the rulers of on the board who will decide how the foundation will have to go after my passing, this way by that time we set up the scene and open the door the for universal community for all aspects of the technology.<br>凯：今天最重要的一个工程是迪拜，让迪拜成为宇宙飞船之城，让迪拜成为和平之城，让这个城市处于凯史基金会新的治理结构之中，也就是我们所说的宇宙（环球）委员会。在 迪拜会议上，我们要求你们带来尽可能多的你所发展的技术，并且我们会为你们提供便利来进行展示，然后我们会坚持到选出新一届的委员会的决策者，这些人会在我去世后决定基金会的运作与走向，通过这种方式，到那时，我们设置相应的环境与条件来打开进入宇宙社区之门，从而获取技术的每个方面。<br> I cannot take the man into space if the man become the slave to the universal community, my job is to make sure the man comes equal and you only equal when you have the all knowledge so all of us in different ways are developing different part of the technology and the knowledge is across what we call one planet community that we are not nations that we have to fight who is controlling what, we control everything together  and we teach everything together this is one of the requisite in becoming part of the universal community that we are one so what you seen I have taken time to teach and to bring you to the point that everyone for you start teaching  and developing, each one of you brings different flavour and different way to do the same thing or add to knowledge to do something else.<br>凯：如果人类成为宇宙社区的奴隶，我就不能将人类带到太空。我的工作就是让人们变得平等，也只有当你们平等了，你才会有所有的知识。所以我们每个人都在以不同的方式发展这个技术的不同方面，知识正在遍及这个地球村，我们不是国家，我们要抵抗那些想要以此进行控制的人，我们在一起就能控制所有事情，我们在一起就能教授所有事情，这是成为宇宙社区一部分的必要条件，我们是一体的。所以正如你们所看见的，我给你们教授知识，把你们带到这一点：你们每一个人都可以进行教学与发展，你们每一个人以自己的偏好和方式做着同样的事情，或者通过做其他的事情来增加知识。<br>I was told that I steal technology, how can I steal the technology when I have given to you freely, I guide and I promote you and in promoting you do not get carried away the idea anything but a person who resist the knowledge and sharing knowledge. We have seen some people who using the knowledge and the ground we given them to be teaching the misguided themselves to become the leaders and everything is wrong with everybody else. We have no rejection we know these things will come but it shows that weakness in the intellect of the man so we will time to time people come and then will claim everything is wrong it’s okay if you added to knowledge but if you are wrong you make sure that the knowledge does not get dispersed to harm the other or do anything in wrong which we have seen in a couple of cases.<br>凯：我被人说我是在偷窃技术，那么当我已经给了你自由的时候我还怎么能偷窃技术呢？<br>我指导你们，我提升你们，通过提升你们让你们不要陶醉于某个想法之中，但是有人还是抵触这些知识以及分享知识。我们看见一些人在利用我们所教授的知识以及给予的平台进行教学使自己误入歧途变成类似的领导者，让其他人认为所有的事情都是错的。我们没有抗拒，我们知道这些事情都会来，但这显示了人类心智的弱点。所以我们会逐渐看到人们变得觉醒，并会声明原来的一切都是错误的。这没关系 。如果你是在增加知识，但如果你错的，你要确保这个知识不会扩散出去伤害其他人，或者做某些我们已经看到过的错误的事情。<br> In so many way the Dubai conference is to bring you together to teach each other and at the same time share the knowledge which cannot be shared in the net build the trust as one race with each other reunion for the whole of the human race that we start building a trusted world. In trust then we can build the next step and in that we promote the this conference, we have set and it’s been agreed because we negoiating on day to day basis for accommodation around the conference in goes one slow way the other way the fast way one of the thing which is been the main concern for people is how they can get the tickets if they can get the tickets will they need a visa.<br>凯：迪拜的会议会通过很多的方式将人们联合在一起，相互教学同时分享那些在网上不能分享的知识，作为一个种族建立起相互之间的信任，将整个人类团结起来，从而构建一个建立在信任基础上的世界。在信任中我们能构建下一步，我们促进宣传这次会议，我们精心设置，而且这已经通过了，因为我们通过各种各样的方式每天都在围绕住宿问题进行协商，其中我们很关心的是人们怎样买到机票，如果他们想要得到机票，他们就需要签证。<br>We have brought in a partner travel agent organisation very known in Dubai that can accommodate your tickets as cheap as possible and accommodate your Visas they handle everything go them go to their website it’s The Partner Travel Agent and they will look after you in every sense you need the transfer from the airport to the hotels and everything else so we take that part of the equation out of your problem that it’s not your problem you can come back you can get a cheaper ticket you are quite welcome and if you can organise it for you and the visa everything is in there it has to be done.<br>凯：我们已经与一家在迪拜很有名的旅行社进行合作，这样就能让你们的机票尽可能的便宜，并能满足你们签证的需求，他们能够代办一切事情，去他们的网站The Partner Travel Agent，他们会在每一个情形中全程照顾你们，从飞机起飞到旅馆入住，以及其他一切事情，所以我们已经替你们分担了忧愁，它不再成为你们的问题了，一旦你预定了，你能以一个很便宜的机票的价格过来，欢迎你们，如果你们自己组织并办好签证，所有的事情都在迪拜等着你，都已经安排好了。<br>So we try to accommodate as much as possible after the first 500 tickets we will increase we have the option to increase if you can keep it we will increase the price is 750 to be there changes in the structure of the payment to the hotel as we are in a position in the very expensive hotels an everything there is confusion if you want to stay extra you can stay on 5 an 7 day extra its 175 Euro  per night not including he breakfast and you can stay the hotel and after with the facilities of the whole park of the hotel which is international level.<br>凯：所以我们尽可能的满足，在首批500个定票之后，我们会增加，我们有这个权力去增加，如果你们能保持不变，我们就可以将价格增加到750欧元，这对于酒店的支付结构来说是一个改变，因为我们是处在一个最昂贵的酒店里。如果在那里有什么困惑，如果你想要额外再呆上5到7天，将会是175欧元每晚，不包括早餐，而且你可以使用亚特兰蒂斯酒店的具有国际水准的整个公园设施。<br>Try it sort out these things that there is no confusion when you join with the payment it covers for your food it covers your breakfast and what you call it the lunch and the tea breaks That is 150Euro for 2 days. If you are in Dubai or part of the United Arab Emirates where you have family who come here you don’t want stay in the hotel the joining fee for a day is 250Euro because the people who say that fee they not pay that fee because its covered as the hotel expenses.<br>凯：理清这些事情，没有什么困惑的，当你加入到我们中，并支付了涵盖食物的费用，这个食物就会包括你的早餐，午餐以及茶点，这是2天150欧元。如果你们中有人住在迪拜或者阿联酋，有家庭这里，你们不想住在酒店，参加的费用是250欧元一天，因为人们说他们不想要支付涵盖酒店的费用。<br> In so many ways we are ready to change the humanity and it’s us who got to do it you not need to be a member of the Keshe foundation you can come feel an taste the sense of unity and then join the space university and university community as you feel an become part of the new generation of the free man, not only on this planet but in space, 21st 22nd of April will be a part of the change in course of humanity some of you return and in generations to come they say I was there when it was established, very much the way we remember different things where we were when it happen,  come in we be part of it an you never know when you are here if your soul grow here or it was your decision when it was a member of the council we not letting, we will be guided it’s the new way and it’s the way it’s done in space, there is no bribery and there is no body who is promoted.<br>凯：通过各种方法，我们准备改变人类，这是由我们来做，你不需要成为凯史基金会的一员，你能过来，感受与品尝团结统一的价值与意义，加入到太空这所大学，这个社区，你会感到成为新一代自由的人类，不仅是在这个星球上而且是在太空中。4月21，22号将会是改变人类进程的一部分，你们中返回的人，在新的时代来临后，会自豪的说当时它建立的时候我在那里，就如同我们所记得的在哪里以及什么时候发生的不同一般的事件，来吧，成为它的一部分。只有你来到这里，你才会知道你的灵魂是否在成长，是否成为委员会的一员这将是你自己的抉择，我们是被引导而不是在计算思考，这就是新的方式，是在太空中运作的方式，没有贿赂，没有人是被推销的。<br>You will know how devoted you are when you find yourself with yourself if you can and you will be the member on the world executive power. Then we allow you to choose for us because we give you our full trust. We have a video made for this which should be ready the its been the team working in the background in US and Canada ot get it done and I was told it was finished yesterday or last night, would you like to play the promotion video for this please? It’s not coming up. Yeah<br>凯：你会知道你有多大的投入与奉献，你会发现内在的自己，如果你能并且成为世界执行委员会的一员的话。然后我们允许你为我们做选择，因为我们给你们全部的信任。我们制作了这方面的一个视屏，应该是工作的在美国和加拿大的团队所制作的，我被告知是在昨天或昨天晚上完成的，你可以播放一下这个宣传视屏吗？还没有开始，好。<br>[Rick]; Yeah we see it<br>瑞克：好，看见了。<br>{From promotion video}<br> You are invited to partake in the creation of humanity’s first Universal community Council on April 21 and 22nd 2016 in Dubai at the one planet one nation one race conference.

In so many ways as we say in English the ball is in our court become nobody, human race has never had such an opportunity as I said in my talks to have the financial position to be independent that they can decide their own future the foundation financing all these things in the background without any help from any government organisation that they can be thanked that we supported. We are doing it ourselves we are doing it through our own strength by what we produce what we sell as Keshe foundation products like the help as  the pen which are released tomorrow and by the power units and by the books and if you receive donations, strange enough is hardly anyone makes a donation and it shows how solid the foundation is.<br>凯：很感谢你们，所有工作在后台的人们，能把这个做出来，看见这个视屏很愉快。我们能够改变现状，我们能够作为一个国家进行改变，并为我们的星球决定未来。从很多方面来看，就像我们说的，用英语说就是下一个就看我们的了（球在我们的手里），没有其他任何人能够代替我们，就像在我的谈话中所说，人类种族从没有这样的机会拥有这样的一个能够使自己独立的财力状况，他们能够决定自己的未来，基金会能够在没有政府组织的支持下资助在背后所有进行的事情，我们通过我们自己做到，我们通过自己的力量做到，通过我们生产并出售基金会的产品，比如明天将要释放的医疗笔，还有能量装置和书。很奇怪的是任何人都很难捐款，这显示出基金会是多么的牢固。<br>All you come and take the knowledge and you see it as you said by somebody, everybody expects everything free from the foundation which organisation works like this and they want everything and if you don’t do it its something wrong with us, so now you understand how much is wrong with you how many of you have made the pain pen and release the pen, how many of you have helped yourself with the system and build your stacker and save energy and you have not contributed anything where the knowledge came from we don’t ask you because from now on  every soul stand and judges to himself, a lot of you making a lot of effort putting these units out in public giving it away, especially I know today while we are speaking the Keshe foundation team in Holland is giving units pens and pads to people in public teaching them what to do, I thank you to Dutch group to Dutch Keshe foundation you are based in your country we will start from your country and in so many ways its your Keshe foundation more than anybody else.<br>凯：你们都来，并且学到了知识，你会看到，正如有些人说的，每个人都期望基金会里的每件东西都是免费的，他们想要每件东西，如果你不能满足，错就在我们。所以你明白了，你有多么错，你们中有多少人做了止痛笔，减轻了疼痛；你们中有多少人用这个系统帮助到你们自己，并且通过能量盒节省了能量，你没有对知识的来源之处做出贡献，我们不要求你们，从现在开始，每个人都对自己的灵魂负责。你们中很多人做了很大的努力，将这些单元拿到公众面前分发出去，尤其今天我们谈到荷兰的凯史基金会团队将止痛笔与止痛包免费发给公众，并教会他们如何使用。我很感谢荷兰团队，你们根基于你们的国家，你们从你们的国家开始，而且从多方面来讲，这是你们的凯史基金会甚于其他任何人。<br>In so many ways we have to take the step to change  the course and in so many ways we have to take and be there to change the course, we do not understand still in what we do how we help and what I have overcome, so try to teach to as many as you can, we see teaching going around the world on the daily bases we have become one of the most powerful independent scientific organisations in the world because it’s us, its millions of us, nobody can stop us nobody can patent our technology because we give it freely its already patented in the soul of the man. I was talking to Lisa she says some Chinese have developed something but they want to commercialise it s and they are very slow to come out, I said let them commercialise it they come out and they will be part of the Keshe foundation so they receive the benefit of it by themselves.<br>凯：通过各种方式，我们必须采取行动进一步改变这个进程；通过各种方式，我们必须直接参与改变这个进程的过程中，我们仍然还不明白我们做什么，我们怎样提供帮助，我们已经经历与克服了什么，所以尽你们的可能进行教学，我们看见教学每天都在世界各地进行着，因为这是我们，有几百万人的我们，没有人可以阻止我们，没有人可以把我们的技术专利化，因为我们已经免费释放出来，它根植于人的灵魂。我跟中国的丽萨谈过，一些中国人已经发展了相关的技术，他们想要商业化运营，他们很慢才能公开，我说就让他们商业化吧，他们公开后就会成为凯史基金会的一部分，所以他们就能通过自己受益。<br> Please make sure all of you who are making this to give away as charity whatever do not use the logo of the Keshe foundation as science they should use it unless you receive authorisation as a manufacturer from us because you make the pen and you give it freely, if anything happens to people then you can cause yourself a lot of problem when we give the copyright when we give the licence to use the SSI we give licence on your behalf to protect you, we don’t ask for any money but like the Keshe foundation society the pads and the pens are have eceived CE certification which mean we can go more or less everywhere with it within the EU and worldwide this is the certificate we have if it’s acceptable to your government we make order if it’s not it’s your responsivity to make sure it’s within the legal limit, I know a lot of people say manufacturers are responsible but we are responsible to sell and the condition is there and if you want import in your country please get your certificate confirmed.<br>凯：请确保你们在做这些装置并将它作为慈善的事业发送给人们的时候，不要使用凯史基金会SSI的标识，除非你从我们这里得到一个生产制造商的授权，因为你制作了笔，将它免费发给人们，如果有人出现了问题，你就给自己造成很大的麻烦。当我们授予版权与许可证去使用SSI，我们就能通过许可证给你们提供保护，我们不索取任何金钱，但是像凯史基金会出的产品如健康包和医疗笔都已经得到欧盟的认证，这意味着我们差不多可以走向任何地方，在欧盟内和世界范围内。这就是我们的认证，如果你们的政府接受的话，我们可以办理相关的程序；如果不接受，那就成为你们的责任，确保你们所做的在法律的范围内，我知道很多人说制造商是有责任的，但是我们有责任出售，条款在那里，如果你想要在你的国家生产，请让你的资格得到认证。<br> We pass standards we put things to the application of the standards and we try to comply to the international law but if you are spending so much to go everywhere to do everything all the 180 nations you never get to produce everything so we have got all our products have a CE certification it’s your responsibility to make sure the product coming to your country is according to legislation of your nation when you order it. Or you accepted vedio  only responsibility This is the way we are all very clearly about it.<br>凯：我们通过了测试标准，我们把东西投入到标准的应用，我们试着遵守国际法律，但如果你花费很多钱到各个地方去，在180个国家做所有的事情，你绝不会生产出任何东西，我们所有的产品有CE认证，当你订购了产品，然后就是你们的责任即要确保进入到你们国家的产品符合你们国家所制定的法律，或者只接受视屏里的责任，这是我们都知道的。<br>On the sale of the Keshe foundation side we put this on, these are goods certified at the moments these are goods made in Europe they have a CE certification if you want to see if it fits the condition of your county and licencing and you put everything on, for those of you who are physicians in EU we have a certificate as alternative medicine in Belgium which applies to most of the Europe automatically so we can give the certificate that these systems can be used and we teach you how to use it as a patient. We come to a very important point and then we start a blueprint day, I have received a number of calls and I have seen a number of communications across the internet and to me directly please do not promote people to move because of the earthquake in or around the world, it’s my responsibility to do as I see because of you who call me because you talk about it and it happens it shows you have not even understood the work of physicality of the plasma of the earth and you stand responsible for the souls of those who you will cause the death of.<br>凯：在凯史基金会出售产品方面我们把这些公布出来，这个产品是经过认证的，目前在欧洲生产，都有欧盟的认证，如果你想要看它是否符合你们国家的环境和交易许可，我们做好所有的事情，你们中有人是欧盟的医生，我们在比利时有作为替代医药的认证产品，可以自动适用于大部分的欧洲，我们可以给你资格认证，这些系统就可以被使用，我们会教授你如何为你的病人使用它。我们再将一个很重要的一点，然后我们开始蓝图日，我收到很多的电话，我已经看见很多人通过网络直接联系我，请不要因为世界性地震而劝说人们迁移到其他地方，我把我所看见的说出来这是我的责任，我看见因为你们联系我，因为你们在谈论，这些显示了你还不曾理解地球等离子体的物理层面的工作，你会为那些你所引起的死亡的人的灵魂负责。<br>Those of you who don’t understand and go and say you are talking about and it’s happening it means you haven’t understood what volcanic eruptions earthquake has happened for millions of years the way the planet works and we see a huge one and a scientific bases to happen to take place and it’s our job to do to save live and those of you who write to us that I am going to go public that you are a fake and the rest because you don’t stop promoting it means any death caused because of any of the volcanic eruptions and earthquakes which is depending you are responsible for the soul of the people who you have murdered.<br>凯：你们那些一直在谈论这些事情的人其实不明白，你们还不明白火山地震已经持续了上百万年了，这是地球运作的方式，我们看见一个巨大的有科学依据的现象会发生，我们的工作是拯救人的生命，那些给我写信的人，我要公开说你其实是一个骗子，因为你不停止宣传，这意味着任何由火山与地震所造成的死亡是有关联的，你会为你所谋杀的那些人的灵魂负责。<br> So we finish with this discussion and we carry on with the way it should and has to be done, it is the responsibility of us as scientists which understands the work of the not only the planet but structure of the pressure on this planet one because of the motion of the magma underneath second because of the change of the season and the pressure of the southern hemisphere at this time and thirdly because of the feature of what we call the 2nd star which is a twin star of the earth which creates certain pressures of its own which increases the pressure at this time on the southern hemisphere and fourthly because of the position of our solar system with its twin sister in the funnel of the wings of the galaxy there is a possibility not tomorrow, next week, next month but in the next couple of months or next year or so the pressure will crack or separate the thin layer of the continent of southern America of weigh at the point of Panama and floating on magma this is the reacting so those of say we taken it out and it will not happen we are from the centre of the earth please sir if you are from the centre of the earth what we call the enlighten one or whatever please tell us what’s happening inside in the centre and plus how we are going to stop this, they call themselves the light workers, you are the darkest forces ever existed because you don’t look for the benefit of humanity if you see a child running under a car, do you spender and say the life move you or  you move to  move the child but the child doesn’t get hurt.<br>凯：所以我们不再讨论这个问题，我们仍然认为这些地球事件是它的发展规律也应该会发生，这是作为我们科学家的责任—不仅要理解这个星球的运作，也要理解施加在这个星球上的压力，一个是地下的岩浆；第二因为季节的变化和此时施加给南半球的压力；第三是由于作为地球的孪生星球的第二星球的临近，使得地球给自身创造了一些压力，也就是在这个时候给南半球施加了压力；第四是由于我们我们太阳系与它的双生系统所处的位置——在银河旋臂的漏斗里，有一种可能性，不是明天，下个星期，下个月，下几个月或者明年，这个压力会将南美大陆这一漂浮在岩浆上面的薄层断裂或者分离开来，也就是在巴拿马这个位置点，这是相互影响的结果。所以你们中那些人说可以避免灾难，它不会发生，我们来自地心世界，好，如果你来自地球中心，叫做光导者或者什么，那么请告诉我们地球中心发生了什么，并且我们该如何阻止这一切，他们称自己为光工，你们才是从未有过的黑暗力量，因为你们并不为人类谋福祉，如果你们看见一个孩子在一个汽车下面玩耍，这样的情况能让你感到担心吗，你能够去移开这个孩子，从而让它避免受伤吗？<br>Human race is the child of the creator and they will be protected so you can talk whatever you like but those of you who come with these lies of whatever you are and w you gonna expose we fed you we taught you and now because you taught a few thing now you thought you know everything it show the lack of understanding and shallowness of the depth the intellect. So please move from California from west coast of United States continent.<br>凯：人类是造物主的孩子，并且受到保护，所以无论你们讨论喜欢什么，但是那些用这些谎言进行说教的人，无论你是什么，你都要暴露出来。我们提供能量给你，我们教授你们知识，现在因为你们在教一些东西就认为你们知道所有的事情，这显示出认知的短浅以及心智深处的黑暗。所以从加利福利亚搬走，从美国大陆西海岸搬走。<br>My warning cannot be any stronger we have seen it now the pattern is getting stronger and there is a huge possibility of in the coming time of movement of the continental plate because everything is ready for it and once that goes and the pressure of the southern hemisphere due to upcoming after 21st of February till 20th, 18th of April it’s the switch time. If we see the approach of the 2nd sun which will put pressure on the southern hemisphere it’s like the peace of metal. You have keep on twisting it  twisting it till there is weakest point it separate we are in that positon, understand the physiology of it. The earth pressure on the southern hemisphere pushes now on the southern continent which sits on the American continent the magma is working anti clockwise so its pulling it towards the African and southern European section that why we say we said you will see earthquake in southern Europe and Northern Africa we have seen in Djibuti we have seen it in Argentina its following the same pattern its combined forces which is creating this, I would like the people the enlightened what we call the light workers please go underneath of this surface and hold it back if you can stand the heat of the magma.<br>凯：我的警告不能再有力了，我们已经看到了，现在整个图像越来越清楚，在未来大陆板块的运动是高概率事件，因为一切都为此准备好了，一旦启动，就会给南半球造成压力，从2月21号到4月18,19号，这是一个转变期。如果我们看见第二太阳的临近，会给南半球施加压力，这就像是一块金属，你不停的扭曲它，直到出现一个薄弱点，产生分离，我们就处在这个状态，要理解这个生理机制。地球施加在南半球的压力作用到南方大陆，也就是美洲大陆，岩溶是逆时针工作的，所以就造成朝向非洲和南欧的一个向外的拉力，这就是为什么我说你会在南欧和北非看见地震，我们在吉伯特和阿根廷都看到了，它们遵循同样的模式，这是一种相互结合的力量造就的。我希望那些所谓的光导者或者光工们能够到地下去，坚持住直到灾难过去，如果你们能忍受住岩溶的炙热的话。<br> Wishes does not change the reality of the work of then the nature you stand in front of the fire in the bush and just blow on it and wish it will go away, you will get burned in it if the blow is in your direction and those of you who say we created and it can be done you moved it please go back to a 1000 years ago, 2000 years ago when man had no understanding of the science and sacrifices raging out that the earth quake will stop this is what was tradition we are going back to that dimension with these people cause they thought the virgin body will stop the earth quake and now we know we laugh at it the same thing is coming up again so please move. Move in the only manner out of the west of American continent central continent will get pressurised through the same and constantly the pressure will go into the north and consequently it will come down in a lot of places it just happened to be our time.<br>凯：愿望改变不了自然运作的规律，你站在燃烧的灌木丛的面前，只是吹动它，希望火离开，如果燃烧的走向是朝向你那一边的话你就会被烧伤，那些说使我们创造的，能够得到解决，你可以移走它，那就请你回到1000年前，2000年前，那时人们还不明白科学，然后会献祭一个处女，然后地震就会停止了，这就是那个时空维度的人们的传统，他们认为这个纯洁的身体能够阻止地震，现在我们知道了，在笑话他们，同样的事情也再次来临了，所以请离开，唯一的方式就是离开美国西海岸，中部大陆也会经历同样的压力，在持续的运动过程中压力会传导到北部，然后会向下移动到很多地方，它刚好就发生在我们的时代。<br> The way it happened to be the time of dinosaurs when meteorite came when the second star approached earth and pushed all the meteorite towards the centre and now we are in same position and in a way why American continent is in that position look and see the structure. Look and then you understand why there is weak point, it’s come to the weak point it’s like a chewing gum when you pull it and then at the weak point it just snaps. The weak point between the 2 continents which can take the pressure is the Panama point and this is what we see it and this is we have and we have discussed to be.<br>凯：在恐龙时代，陨石来临，第二星来临，将所有的陨石推向中心，现在我们也面临同样的情况。为什么美国大陆是在那样的位置上，仔细看这个结构。仔细看你就会明白，这里有一个薄弱点，当它来到这个薄弱点，就像嚼口香糖，将它拉开，出现薄弱点，很容易裂开。在2个大陆之间的极易承受不住压力的薄弱点是在巴拿马，这就是我们所看到的，这就是我们要讨论的。<br> The position is relevant and the backlash of these things will show itself in Philippine and other parts of the world in what we call the East Asia how far and how fast it will go we don’t know. 2 things we just happened in the past 24 hours that 2 days, 3 days we have seen what is been the eruption or the beginning of the earth quake which is opening of volcanic area within California and this whenever it happens and some of them have been dormant for 15000 years when these happens always have followed with the heavy shift of the continental plate and this time when the southern continent splits the shift will come the powers will be much more powerful, whenever earth what we call the volcanic eruptions have happened in this part according to the scientific data within days and weeks we have seen huge earthquakes in the level of the ocean level and this is happen in past 24 hours this is a clear warning go on the internet and look of at the double volcanic eruptions and the one before in the same area whenever it has happened in this level the continent has start moving its where the magma can open up to release the pressure that the plates can move, it’s like pressure cooker now it opening up .<br>凯：位置是相关联的，这些事件会产生一个连锁的激烈的反应，会在菲律宾以及世界其他如东亚地显现出来。它会进行的多大程度以及进行的多快我们是不知道的，2件事情在过去24小时，过去2到3天发生了，我们看见了在加利福尼亚火山群区域地震出现的迹象，无论火山何时发生，它们中的一些已经休眠了15000年，但它们爆发时就会伴随着强烈的大陆板块的转移，当南美板块断裂开就会使大陆板块转移的力量更为强大。根据最近几天以及几周的科学的数据，这些区域火山已经呈现爆发的态势，我们在海洋的层面上也看见了巨大的地震，这是在过去24小时发生的，这是一个清晰的警告，去网上查看这种双重效果的火山爆发，以及以前所发生的，无论什么时候在这些区域发生过，大陆板块已经开始移动，从而导致熔浆活跃释放出压力，再进一步导致板块的移动，就像高压锅，现在已经打开了。<br>So please assess yourself and consider yourself and consider yourself on which part of the world you are in danger or can the possibility of danger. As you know and I have said in the talk of Tuesday specially your government his excellency president Obama for American nation has put in order after our talk in the 2nd of February executive order for the earth quake committee or the group that will start looking at the earth quake, this committee has ot start acting you don’t have much time. This is very clear warning this is the last time we make such a warning it’s the responsibility of government to look after the people it’s the responsibility of the Keshe foundation members to be ready in the time of accident.<br>凯：所以评估自己，为自己考虑，认清楚自己是在世界哪一个比较危险的地方，或者有可能会变得危险。你们知道，我在星期二的教学中说过，尤其你们的政府，奥巴马总统在我们2月2号讲话后就着手颁布法令建立应对地震的部门，这个委员会已经开始行动，你们没有多少时间了。这是很清晰的警告，这是最后一次，我们已经做了这样的警告，照顾人民是政府的责任，做好危机发生时的准备是凯史基金会的责任。<br>We have seen what we were waiting for to take place and it has taken place now the clock is ticking those of us who accuse us of scaring you have to live with yourself why did I do this when the warning came and I did not let people see and I changed the mind of one person to move because I thought I know in fact you are responsible for those you change their mind because of your ignorance and then you are responsible for their souls, I stand clear with my soul with what I know and what I am here for, it’s my responsibility as a scientist as who I am is to protect the children of the man and we see problem we are very clear about it we don’t care what people say just because they ate from our cup and they poisoned their own cup with it. My warning goes very clearly please start moving out of the west coast of united states chilly north Canada, we see waves 2-300 metre high in the longest ships.<br>凯：我们已经看见我们所等待的已经发生了，时钟滴答作响，迫在眉睫，你们中指控我们在恐吓你们的人，只是想要生活在自己的世界里，为什么我要这样做，当警告来临时，不让人们看见，改变人们想要搬走的想法，因为我原认为我知道，事实上你对那些你使其改变想法的人负责，由于你的无知，你为他们的灵魂负责，我很清楚我的灵魂，按照我的灵魂行事，我很清楚我所知道的，我在这里是为了什么，作为一个科学家这是我的责任，作为我的灵魂，我要保护人类这个孩子，我满看见了问题，我们对此十分确认；我们不在乎人们说什么，因为他们从我们这里获取信息然后滥用在自己身上。我的警告已经越来越清晰，请搬离美国西海岸转移到寒冷的加拿大北部。我们看见高达200到300米的且长度最长的海浪。<br> I cannot be any clear enough and today I go silent with it because I finish in and I explain scientifically to you what the reason is. The movement you might call it a disaster you might call it volcanic eruption you might call it whatever is imminent, next few days next few weeks, next few months all depends on the pressures and if all the pressure coincidentally come together there will be a huge catastrophe we are safe in the city of Dubai. I am safe I should not care about what happens to the humanity and the rest of it but I do care is my responsibility it’s under my time my watch.<br>凯：我已经不能说的更清楚了，此后我会保持沉默了，因为我已经完成我该做的，我已经科学性的向你们解释原因是什么。这个运动，无论你叫它是灾难也好，还是火山爆发也好，或者你无论叫它什么，是迫在眉睫的。或者是接下来几个星期，几周，几个月，这都取决于压力，如果所有的压力偶然的汇集在一起，就会形成巨大的灾变，我们在迪拜是安全的。我是安全的，我应该可以不用担心在人类身上以及其他事物所发生的，但是我关心，这是我的责任，这是在我的时间里我的观察之中。<br>All of you light workers please go down   the ground and lift the earth just about 22cm that it doesn’t snap with the pressures of the change of the season and then we see if you are a light worker you are light liars and you found yourself a name to be working with, so I am very clear and it’s the last warning we give you I hope in the next session you will still be with us and in the session to come and if you are not and if anything happens Keshe foundation is there to support you , the disaster of the movement of the 2 continents is eminent, now we go on how we can feed ourselves and we can look after ourselves in different dimensions in space, do not right to me and ask when it’s going to happen, you all see it that heard this you heard that we made our point we will not discuss it till the summer time but make sure you understand the physiology of it keep your eyes on ti because when it come its comes very rapidly because now the continental pressure on the southern core will push the American continent once it goes loose down and all the volcanos will pop like nothing. You can see the exactly what the, one the 2nd of December when we made the original warning, the warning is absolutely in the critical point and we have seen another scientist after the announcements are coming with more proof of different places that can happen and even the white house is not safe. Now we go to the blueprint, before we go if there are any question because when we go into the blueprint we will not come out of it till the end of the session today are they any other questions you want me to answer before I start?<br>凯：你们中所谓的光工者，请到地面下去，离开地表，只需要到地面下22CM深处，那里在周期的变化所造成的压力下不会断裂，然后我们看你们是否是光工，你们是光之骗子，你们为自己找到一个名称以便进行你们的工作，所以我很清楚，这是我给你们的最后的警告，我希望在下一个教学中你们仍然和我们在一起，但当事件来临时，如果你们不能和我们在一起，凯史基金会会给你们提供支持，2个大陆板块之间运动所造成的灾难是迫在眉睫的，现在我们继续讨论我们如何为自己提供能量，以及在太空中不同的维度里照顾自己，不要再直接问我什么时候发生，你们都看见了，我们说了那个点，直到这个夏天来临我们不会再谈论这个问题。但是要确保你理解它的生理机制，时刻保持警醒，因为当它来临时会十分的快速，因为现在施加到南半球核心的板块压力会推挤美国大陆核心，使其变得松动，所有火山就会突然齐发。你们看到，在11月2日我们做了最初的警告，警告绝对是在一个临界点，在声明过后我们看见有其他科学家提供了其他地方会发生的更多的证据，即使白宫也不是安全的。现在我们开始进行蓝图教学，在此之前有什么问题可以提出来，因为我们一旦进行蓝图教学直到结束不会谈论其他话题，在我开始之前你们有什么问题需要我回答吗？<br>[somebody]: Yes<br>某人：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes<br>凯：好<br>[somebody]: Yes I am from the mid-west in the united states and I wanted to try talk to people about getting out of California but its mid-west they said there is a fault line or something that they also hit the Midwest I hadn’t heard much about that I just wanted to<br>某人：是的，我来自美国中西部，我想要劝说人们离开加利福尼亚，但他们说在中西部有一个断裂带，地震也会袭击到中西部，这我从没有听说过，我只是想要知道。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: This is a report by an American scientist on the back of the presidential executive order that they are trying to assess and what they see in different of United States and different part of the world what might happen. We have seen increase in volcanic activities on the coast line of the west of the United States continent and on the other end which takes the pressure. We predict earthquakes in Tehran on that zone as well because it’s a connection underneath which pushes it up so it’s due to with this pressure so high the Dalolan can go and see the earthquake in Tehran simultaneous or around the same time depends on what the pressure is.<br>凯：这是在总统行政命令的支持下美国科学家的报告，他们试图想要评估在美国各地以及世界各地可能发生的事，我们看见在美国西海岸火山活动明显增长，同时在另一端也承受着压力。我们预计在德黑兰也会发生地震，因为这是地球内部的联系所产生的向上的推力使然，由于这个压力是如此的高，Dalolan（地名）会产生移动，就会同时看见在德黑兰发生地震，或者有一定的时间差，这取决于压力的情况。<br>You go understand if the southern continent the American continent goes down by another 5cm if it drops in the motion it doesn’t drop because its freed it tries to find its own balance up to now the northern continent and the Pangea has kept if floating, it’s like on a jet ski and with a rope with the man who is skiing, that rope has been the continent of the continental position in panama and now with that opening up its on its own, now it has to find its own balance it’s like when you drop a ball in the water in the pool it goes up and down til it finds the balance, if its weight releases pressure more than it is on the continental magna then we see the popping up like nothing all the volcanic layers will pop up like popcorn because it the law of physics when you drop something on the liquid it has to create its buoyancy where is gonna stand and it creates waves and those waves will pop a lot of volcano that’s what we see a lot of volcanic activities at the moment because at the point of panama the continent is made use the Chilean earthquake which we saw a few months ago when we announced it a huge one had shown the release of it, it was just like you been holding it not the continent becomes free it has to find over next decade its balance its buoyancy and as it goes up and down over next 20 years to find it will start popping when it goes to lower it pops all the volcanic situation which have not worked for years, this is how it works, people when this happens they have 2 choices.<br>凯：你要明白如果美洲大陆下沉5CM，如果它处在下沉的运动中，它不会下沉，因为它自由释放，寻找自己的平衡点，到现在为止，北部大陆与班吉保持浮动，就像滑艇，一个人绑在绳子上在后面滑翔，这根绳子就像是巴拿马的位置，现在随着（压力）打开释放了，它得寻找自己的平衡，就像你把一个球扔在水池里，它上下起伏，寻找自己的平衡。如果它得到释放，产生压力，超过它本身保持在熔岩的程度，我们就会看见爆发，所有的火山层就会像爆米花一样爆发，因为这是物理规律。当你像液体中丢进某个东西，它会创造出浮力，以保持自身平衡，同时也创造出波浪，这些波浪会激荡大量的火山，这就是目前我们看见有大量的火山处于活跃中的原因。在巴拿马这个位置上，大陆通过这个接合点连接在一起，我们在几个月前看到的智利地震，当我们宣布公告的时候，一个巨大的地震已经显示出这种压力的释放，这就像你一直在紧握着，现在变得自由了，它得在接下来20几年中寻找自己的平衡与浮力，当它在接下来20几年通过上下起伏来寻找平衡的过程中，当向下运动时就会产生向上的爆发力，从而引爆所有的火山，包括哪些很多年未见活跃迹象的火山。这就是它的工作机理，当它发生时，人们有2个选择。<br>If the continental plate is within the water what happened in Fukushima we see a huge tsunami sitting. If we see another one like what happened in Jakarta in 2005 we see the same there is a possibility that the earthquake and volcanic eruptions and movement of these continents comes together because one triggers the other then we don’t know. We put the estimate we put the estimate in the region of anything up 200-300 million I see every day I monitor the movement on a daily bases and this is my, I don’t predict anywhere I tell you what is going to happen it’s not a prediction anymore. We have finished with predations the movement will happen t depends if the pressure from atwin the star and its horse on the southern continent of America then we will have a deeper pressure we will add another 10 or 15 cm of depression into the magma and earth and this planet is a contained matter for its plasma you have done the physics you put something somewhere it has to come up in the liquid somewhere else and the liquid magma will come through the volcanic eruptions even seen now in past 48 hours with the movement it now might go up to, a possibility a high possibility.<br>凯：如果大陆块是在水中，就像福岛所发生的，我们会看见一个巨大的海啸。如果我们看见另外一种就像2005年雅加达所发生的，我们看见一样的事情，有一种可能即地震，火山爆发与板块移动都来到一起，因为一个触发另一个，我们就不知道会怎么样了。这个区域的估计数目达到2亿到3亿（人） ，我每天看，每天监测这个运动，我不预测任何地方，我只是告诉你将要发生的，这不再是预测。我们不再预测，这个运动会发生，这取决于，如果压力传导到南美这匹马上，我们会有一个更深的压力，我们就给岩溶增加了一个10到15CM的压力，地球这颗行星是一个复合态的等离子体，不要只从物理上看，你把某些东西放在某处，它在液体中就会找到地方向上运动，这个液体熔岩就会通过火山爆发自我释放出来，我们甚至看到在过去48小时内在向上运动，很高的可能性，很高。<br>[Rick]: Mr. Keshe there is a question from Thomas Hendrik would like to ask about this 2nd star will that be okay to ask that question now<br>瑞克：凯史先生，这里有一个来自托马斯黑德克的问题，就是问你关于第二星的问题，你现在适合回答这个问题吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It’s our twin star it’s not the 2nd star, explain that listen to please go back today and listen to Camelot I just about an hour ago I gave and interview for a couple of hours to Carrie Cassidy on the Camelot I give a link to you later on tonight, tomorrow to Mike Harris and then there is another one interview, we are heavily loading the American section to understand we are on the verge of a huge movement of continental plate it happened to be our time if we didn’t have internet if we didn’t have the community we still would have had it, if we all sit and pray on the ground and move all the fields to us and somewhere in space if we were so good why don’t we fly out so this is going to happen this is the eventuality of the separation of the continent.<br>凯：好，这是双生星，不是第二星，要解释那个，请回到今天的采访录，听卡梅罗，我在几个小时之前接受了卡西迪卡丽在卡梅罗上的采访，我会在今晚或者明天给麦克哈里斯一个衔接，还有另外一个采访，我们着力强调美洲部分，以此让人理解我们是在一个大陆板块将发生巨大运动的边缘，就在我们的时代发生，如果我们没有互联网，没有社区，它还是会发生；如果我们都坐在地上祈祷，将所有的场移向我们，或者太空中的某处，如果我们都是这样好的人，那为何我们不飞走，这样更好。所以这是要发生的，这是一次大陆分离的事件。<br>[Rick]: Okay Thomas can you, I will unmute your microphone see if you can speak there<br>瑞克：好的，托马斯，你能，我对你的耳机静音，这样你就能讲话了<br>[Thomas]: Hi Mr. Keshe this is Thomas from Vienna.<br>托马斯：你好，凯史先生，我是来自维也纳的托马斯<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes<br>凯：你好<br>[Thomas]: About this, sometimes you referred about this as a second star or second sun or something is this the same object or planet are you referring to<br>托：关于这个，有时你提到第二星或者第二太阳或者其他什么，这些都是你所说的同一个东西吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes and its approaching and it creates a pressure on the platform of the continent on the southern, actually if you understand you should be able to predict the direction of the incoming second sun<br>凯：是的，它在接近，并且在南半球这个平面创造一个压力，事实上，如果你理解的话，你应该能够预测这个即将到来的太阳的方向<br>[Thomas]: Because I got, let’s say I had two one vision one day when I was walking at the field and I saw a black star next to the sun and it wasn’t as pig as the sun but it was black not really black the light was bending around it, that is was the first thing I wanted to tell and the second one is, I was researching the history of Babylon and the Sumerian gods and made little bit drawings on my white board and Nipiro itself it’s just a star constipation of the star of Eli and Envil and I didn’t get it yet completely but there is something written in this text which is like a pronouncement and its written that the star will be, will take the middle between Mars and Jupiter maybe I am not sure about all the planets exactly there is something up to this so maybe you have more information or you can share your thoughts on this.<br>托：因为，我有2件事， 一天我漫步在田野上，看到了紧邻太阳左边的一个黑色的星，没有太阳那样大，但是黑色的，真的是黑色，光线在它旁边弯曲，这是我第一件想要说的事情；第二件事是我对巴比伦的历史以及苏米尔人的神做了相应的研究，在我的白板上画了一些图画，尼比鲁只是以利和安维尔星群中的一颗星，我还没有完全弄明白，但在这个文本里面写着一些事情，就像一个声明，它写着这颗星在火星与朱庇特星之间，或许我还没有完全明白所有的星球，有一些与这相关的事情，所以或许你能分享一下你知道的信息或者你的想法<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You see the way we see it the approach of the second sun, let me explain the people who understand the reality of the second sun. Our sun our solar system it just didn’t appear out of nowhere in this galaxy they usual process is the same in the small and the big dimension so what has happened the way you get a neutron which splits into a smaller and bigger part becomes an electron and proton that it keeps its integrity that the still separately working for themselves but they rotate around each other to keep each other in balance, the same thing has happened to our solar system our solar system is electron is electron or a proton of the same division of bigger star somewhere in the past, it wasn’t created out of nowhere and it has the way it has lasted so many billions of years as we see it because it has a twin star which absorbs all the  energy which releases into its atmosphere and it absorbs all the energy that twin  starts sense  its exactly like electron proton.<br>凯：你们看见第二太阳的到来，让我解释一下第二太阳的真实情况。我们的太阳系，不是从银河系哪里突然出现的，它们通常的进程就像小的与大的维度，所发生的就是，你有一个中子，分裂为一个小的与一个大的部分，也就是变成电子与质子，它们保持一个完整性但还是在各自分离的运行，但他们围绕对方旋转，相互之间保持一定的距离，我们的太阳系也是一样的，我们的太阳系就是过去某处的一个更大星球分离出的电子或者质子，它不是从不知名的某处突然冒出来，它有自己的方式，它持续了几十亿年，它有一个双生星，这个双生星吸收所有的能量然后释放到环境中，然后太阳再吸收所有的能量，这样双生星又开始了运作，就像电子与质子的运作情况一样。<br>Finding single individual entities in the universe is very rare and we are not one of them because we in a part of a galaxy system and the galaxy means collection so we have a twin sister or we have twins with something else this twin start of ours approaches like the way in an electronic system we call it the bandwidth of the electron so it moves within that bandwidth and rotates around each other this takes something like 26 million years sometimes this rotation that they come very close and every time I explain this every morning, every time it comes close they put pressure on each other and now what we see and the way I see that the American south continent is moving it gives me a very clear indication the star is sitting in respect to where the south American move facing and we can roughly predict the approach line of the 2nd star through this division because it’s moving its pressure and so much is snapping.<br>凯：在宇宙中找到一个单一的实体是很少见的，我们不是它们中的一个，因为我们在银河系系统的一部分中，星系就意味着聚集，所以我们有一个双胞胎，我们都有一个相对应的双生的事物，我们太阳系的双胞胎的临近就像电子系统中的运作一样，我们叫它电子频宽，所以他在这个频宽内运动，相互之间围绕着旋转，完成这样的一次旋转需要花费差不多2600万年，现在它们之间很接近了，每一次，今天早上我解释过，每一次它们相互接近的时候就想向对方施加压力，现在我们看到的是南美大陆在移动，这就给了我很清晰的指示，这颗星正处在面向于相对于南美大陆运动的方向，通过这种双生系统我们能够大致的画出第二星运行的方向，因为它运动产生压力，很多事物都在发生断裂。<br>All most of the separation of like Australia and the rest has happened this way with the movement of you have a floating magma and you have a piece which is connected with the little piece, every piece which is cut open like this is been hit by the meteorite which is been isolated and with them the isolation has allowed it to be separated by the movement of the magma and the pressures of the magnetic field. It’s just like you get a piece of paper and you keep on twisting it or get a piece of metal you keep on twisting it up and down till it snaps this is what’s going to happen to the continent at this point and this is what we see it’s the coincidentally a lot of things are coming to be at the same time so not only by looking at this southern continental movement we most probably can see if it happens radically where the 2nd sun is coming from we got to look where the earth in that position has been and which way the pressure is coming. So if you look I can go on my camera I can share a camera we got a camera on standing, I show you exactly what is about to happen and then you will most probably can you allow me to share a camera because I don’t need much.<br>凯：所有分离的运动比如澳大利亚以及其他地区所发生的就像这样的方式—浮动的岩浆所形成的运动，你有一块连着另一小块，像这样被切开的孤立的板块，是由于陨石的撞击，这种孤立是由于岩浆运动与磁场压力所造成分离的运动，就像你有一张纸，你一直扭曲它，或者你有一块金属，你一直上下扭曲它，直到它断裂，这就是目前将要发生在大陆板块上的事情，这就是我们所看见的大量的事情耦合的发生在同一时刻，所以不仅看南美大陆的运动，我们也很可能看见，如果它发生的很快，看见第二太阳所来临的方向，我们要弄清楚地球所处的位置，以及压力来自哪个方向。所以，如果我们用摄像头的话，我可以使用摄像头来分享，我们这里有一个摄像头，我可以清楚展示将要发生的，然后你们很可能，你能让我分享一下摄像吗，因为我不需要很多。<br> I cannot open my camera Rick. Okay you need to share okay. Let me show you what it is, this is what’s going to happen in the continent the pressure comes and at the moment we sitting in the magma the continent has been narrowed if I can show it so we are in this point now the pressure in the magma is going to do like this, the pressure coming from the continental side on the southern continent it does not sore the beginning of DuBai I announced in the early  before autumn the pressure was on the northern hemisphere which carries most of the Pangea the continent solid state could take it but now with change of season we are on the southern continent and this cannot take and literally what we see is for example this is the pin where what we call the Panama point and now it’s getting darkness and now the pressure and if the continental and the universal pressure on the 2nd sun comes it just snaps what is does the other end pushes down with pushing down pushes the magma right across and this is what we see because the pressure is pushing new magma to come out so this side the pressure is too high it scientifically can be defined you have no say in it it’s part of the process of our development of this planet and this planet is a living thing and it moves the way we do and we have this problem, do not under no circumstances think because we thought about it came please if it’s the way of thinking and your teaching your light workers don’t forget what they used to do light workers, virgin girls were sacrificed in hundreds to stop the disasters I hope you are not in that region now its criminal offense.<br>凯：我不能打开我的摄像头，瑞克。好，你需要分享，好。让我来展示一下这是什么，这就是在大陆板块上所发生的，压力被施加，我们正处在岩浆上 ，大陆变窄了，如果我能展示出来 （折断了一点），我们就处在这个点位上，压力促使岩浆像这样运动，变成这样 （折断了），压力来自于南美大陆的一边，不会感到疼痛。早前，我们说过，如果压力发生在北部大陆，由于北部大陆是具有来自于盘古大陆时期比较坚固的地质构造，所以压力会被吸收；而现在周期的改变，压力作用在南部大陆，这就难以吸收；实际上，我们所看见的，比如这是一个别针，也就是我们称作的巴拿马点位 ，正在变得黑暗，如果作用与大陆与世界的来自第二太阳的压力来临，就会断裂开，发生什么，另一端向下推，随着向下的推力，将岩浆推向对面，向前推移 ，这就是我们所看见的，因为推力将新的岩浆推挤出来，所以这一边的压力很高（00:54:01），这都能够被科学的定义与解释，没有什么可说的了，这是这个星球运动进程的一部分，这个星球是一个生命体，它有这样的演化路径，我们就遇到了这样的问题。无论何种情况下都不要认为因为我们考虑到了它会到来，光工们，如果这是你们思考与教学的方式，不要忘记，你们一直习惯做的事情，几百年来一直将处女作为献祭以此阻止灾难，我希望你们不在那样的境界里，现在这是犯罪行为。<br> It’s our responsibility to protect and we work on it and we explain it and if you go on it the work on the exception of continental and American continent is becoming active because the pressure is coming at the end of South America the continental south so its pushing the rest stop  so it’s very much as I always explain it’s like a ball you squeeze it has to show something somewhere it comes out of somewhere else, it’s a mass volume the volume of it is fixed you pressurize it, it has to show it has to move no way sitting and pray please sit and pray see if you can take the pressure and then you see how many lives you have to answer to, it our responsibility we take it seriously and I again advice their excellency president Obama you are listening to this program as we know we welcome you as usual please make provision for your nation. My call goes again to the state of Japan the nation of japan with the backlash of what we call tsunami will be wiped out. The biggest concern is the nuclear reactors which is totally separate in this teaching today we will teach you to decontaminate radioactive as we did it on Tuesday and after today we try not to speak about it because I hope we are still together next and I hope we are together for a long time but it’s our job to protect and it’s our job to explain its you who have to make the decision. Any other question?<br>凯：我们的责任是保护，我们工作在这方面，我们解释过。如果你继续看，因为来自南美一端的压力美洲板块的火山会变得活跃，所以它的推力让其他的地方停下来了。这就很像，正如我一直所说的，这就像一个球，你挤压它，它就不得不在另外某处显示出自己，从其他某个地方表现出来，它是质量与体积，是固定的，你推挤它，它就不得不表现出来，不得不移动，坐下来祈祷没有什么作用，请坐下来祈祷吧，看是否可以带走压力，然后你会看见不要为多少生命负责，这是我们的责任，我们认真的对待，我再一次的建议，奥巴马总统阁下，我们知道你在收听这个节目，我们像往常一样欢迎你，请为你们的国家做好准备。我同样呼吁日本，日本这个国家会在所引起的激烈反应中被海啸所淹没，最大的问题是核反应堆，这些反应堆是分离开的，在今天的教学中我们会教授你净化辐射，就像我们在星期二所做的，今天之后我们会试着不再讨论它，因为我希望我们下一次仍然会在一起，我希望我们呆在一起很长时间，但提供保护是我们的工作，做出解释也是我们的工作，由你来做出决定，有其他问题吗？<br>[Thomas]: Mr Keshe I just wanted to share just one last story about the stuff I found out if it’s okay.<br>托：凯史先生，我想要分享一个我所发现的关于这件事情的最后一个故事，可以吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes<br>凯：好。<br>[Thomas]: All I could find in all of these books and all of these histories that it has happened many times in the past and all religions it written in all these books and about this there are the yigigo who were working for the Anonaki long, long time ago and it was I’d say ordered by a goddess council or 50 people the Anuna but in the end the Yigigo rebelled or something against the Anuna and they made another agreement so they can work and live with them side by side so there are always the story where man or what you call them differently par of them is God that they grew up to this universal community and its inside beside the creators or something so the story ends good all the time but there is the flood there is this movement and there is this movement and all of this shifts coming but in the end they get close to each other again<br>托：我在这些书以及历史中所能发现的，而且在过去已经发生过很多次了，所有的宗教都写在书里面，Yigigo很久很久以前就为安奴纳奇人工作，这是由一个诸神委员会指导，或者50人的安奴纳奇人领导的，最后Yigigo发生叛乱对抗阿努纳奇人，他们达成了协议，他们可以并肩在一起工作与生活，总有这样的故事，人类不一样，但都有神的一部分，他们成长进入到宇宙社区，然后与造物主在一起，这些故事结局总是好的，在转变的时期，有洪水，有地理变动，但最后他们相互之间又更接近了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much are there any other question?<br>凯：很感谢，有其他的问题吗？<br>[Rick]: Yeah there is a question about the ways to pay for the April 21st conference Tim say that his community bank does not allow international wire transfers and is there any other alternate way to send the 500 Euros.<br>瑞克：是的，有一个问题，关于4月21号会议的支付问题，提姆说他的社区银行不支持国际转账，还有其他替代的方法支付这个500欧元吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Its 650 Euro including your food. We don’t know it depends what organisation allow I don’t know why the community banks don’t do we receive payments from all over the world ask somebody else who is got a different account in another bank and pay them to pay for you<br>凯：是650欧元，包含你的食物。我们不知道，这取决于各个组织的规定与制度。我不知道社区银行为什么不行，我们可以接受来自世界各地的付款，可以叫另外一个人在另一个不同的银行代替你支付。<br>[Rick]: yes that’s what I was suggesting too he mentions that you have to have an account with them for minimum of one year so he has just to find someone who is a friend that has an account for one year I guess and then pay that way.<br>瑞克：是的，这也是我所建议的。他提到这样的账户需要至少已经存款一年，所以他叫他的一个有这样账户的朋友帮他付款。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: There is no problem we see a lot of banks due to whatever reasons at the moment a lot of banks they tell you there is problem they can’t do it because in fact the world bank has put restriction on the bank itself to move because there are financially unstable we see that a lot in Italy in Italy a large number of banks are in disaster condition bankruptcy or just been floating with the back of development any money going into them or out of them closed month will be very much by the government and we have seen the transfers have to be authorised by central bank and the bank have received the money that the client receives and doesn’t disappear on the bank bankruptcy<br>凯：没问题。我们看见大量的银行，由于各种原因，目前有很多银行都有问题，它们不能正常运行，事实上世界银行在这些银行身上施加了限制，因为金融上不稳定；在意大利我们看见很多，在意大利有大量的银行在灾难性的破产状态中，在政府的支持下勉强维持，任何从中进入或出来的钱款被政府长时间管控，我们看见资金的转移由中央银行来进行授权，这样银行才能收到钱，客户的钱也不会因为银行破产而消失。<br>[Rick]: I see there is 2 people that are mentioned in the chat transferwise.com can be used to instead of the bank to make transfers and they have a good rate as well so that’s transferwise all one word .com I guess that will help people if they get in trouble that way<br>瑞克：我看见有两个人提到transferwise.com 这个网站可以帮到忙，它能够代替银行转账，而且汇率也不错，所以transferwise all one word .com可以给在这方面有问题的人们帮到忙。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah but try what we said Dubai is safe place and is part of the equation for movement for time we are here till everything settles so we can move out regarding the movement of the earth till we don’t see settlement we will not move because we are not here to be there when it happens to be able to support. Strange enough if this movements happens as I said a lot of countries in Europe like Belgium Holland especially England will see the flooding we seen a few years ago decade ago because there is a problem in that straight of England when the pressure comes on 2 sides the English channels put the pressure back on the river and into Holland with all the dikes will pop up. This will the same repetition it will be the wall the change will not be able to hold the rise.<br>凯：是的，我们说迪拜是安全的，我们在这里作为此次地理运动的平衡点，直到所有的事情尘埃落定，于是我们根据地球运动的情况就可以搬走了；没有稳定下来的迹象，我们是不会伴奏的，我们在这里就是为即将来临的事件提供帮助。引人注目的是，如果此次运动发生，大量欧洲北部的国家如比利时，荷兰，尤其是英国，将会面临大量的洪水，我们在几年前或几十年前已经看到过，英国首当其冲，有来自英国海峡2个方向的压力，这些压力同时会将海水推回到荷兰，所有堤坝将会崩塌。同样会重复，大坝难以承受住这样的冲击。<br>[Rick]: Okay I think we could probably go on Mr. Keshe, Tim asked will the blueprints of the health unit be released today like the Magrav was<br>瑞克：好，我认为我们可以继续。凯史先生。提姆问健康单元的蓝图会像磁引力场装置一样在今天释放出来吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes  we are going as people show it become the blueprint it’s how we organised it, as we approach the system this is how it’s going to be the blueprint is your development on the health, you have tested it with your people you have developed to agriculture the same you, I think do we see Benjamin is he online has me manged to join us.<br>凯：是的，我们会开始，人们都展示出来就形成了蓝图，这就是我们如何组织的，我们一起做成系统，是你们在健康方面的发展形成了蓝图，你们在测试，也是你们在农业上进行发展，我认为，看见本杰明了吗，他在线吗？让他加入到我们。<br>[somebody]: Mr. Keshe may I ask a question<br>某人：凯史先生，我能问一个问题？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No let us get Benjamin because there is a weak point in the communication with Africa if we have him we better do the start of the teaching of the blueprint with the agriculture. We will come to you please keep your position we will come to you when we finish. Benjamin can you hear me?<br>凯：不。让我们联系上本杰明，因为与非洲线上交流信号比较弱，如果我们连上他，我们就最好开始关于农业方面蓝图的教学，我们会回来找你，请你保持在线，当我们完成蓝图教学后我们会回来找你。本杰明，你能听见吗？<br>[Benjamin]: Hello, Sir, I can hear you<br>本杰明：在，先生，我们能听见。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It’s nice to hear your gorgeous voice how are you?<br>凯：很高兴听到你的声音，你现在怎么样？<br>[Benjamin]: I am fine sir<br>本：我很好，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Tell us what you have done and what you are going to show us<br>凯：告诉我们你做了什么，你会向我们展示什么？<br>[Benjamin]: Okay we have something to show on agriculture water treatment and then something that I have done with the mushrooms and then an aquarium tank that is an observation. These are we have mainly 3 things to show today so, I will share my screen with<br>本：好的，我们有关于农业水处理的展示，然后我们研究了蘑菇，我们也正在观察一个水族箱，我们今天主要有3件事要展示，我要开始分享视屏了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You don’t lose the bandwidth I know you send your document to Vince, Rick has them if you want we show it from here tell us what you send up so it doesn’t put pressure on your bandwidth.<br>凯：你没有失去网络带宽，我知道你将文件发送给文斯了，瑞克也有了。如果你想要展示，我们可以展示出来，这样就不会给你那边的网络带宽造成压力<br>[Benjamin]: Okay, but it’s okay I think we have a nice bandwidth here so can…<br>本：好的，我认为我们这里有一个好的带宽<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay carry on. Is Doctor Nana from the space institute of Ghana with you?<br>凯：继续。加纳太空机构的娜娜博士与你在一起吗？<br>[Benjamin]: Yeah Doctor Nana is sitting right here with me.<br>本：是的，娜娜博士正和我坐在一起<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Good morning Doctor Nana.<br>凯：早上好，娜娜博士<br>[Nana]: Good morning Mr. Keshe good morning<br>娜娜：早上好，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Nice to speak to you<br>凯：很高兴和你说话<br>[Nana]: Nice to hear from you, thank you<br>娜娜：很高兴听到你的声音，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you, hopefully we meet soon in Ghana.<br>凯：谢谢，希望我们会很快在加纳见面<br>[Nana]: Sure<br>娜娜：当然<br>[Benjamin]: Okay, Mr. Keshe Doctor Nana has managed to, okay, okay there is a publication on the Keshe foundation in one of the monthly magazines here called Ghana, Ghana scientists she used plasma technology for nation development that was an article that was an article written by Doctor Nana and she is telling the world about the technology the Keshe foundation technology I think I need to share my camera so that I can show it, I will start my camera sharing.<br>本：好的，凯史先生，娜娜博士想要，好，在名叫“加纳”的杂志上有关于凯史基金会的介绍，“加纳科学家应该利用等离子体技术用于国家的发展”，这一篇文章是由娜娜博士写的，她在告诉世界凯史基金会的技术，我需要分享一下我的屏幕，这样我能展示一下，我将开始分享屏幕<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes we can see your, please make sure you don’t show us your page that we don’t show us your program. Its okay now he wants to show us the magazine.<br>凯：是的，我们能看见，请确保你不要展示你的项目的页面，好了，你要给我们展示这个杂志<br>[Benjamin]: The magazine so we have a magazine called Ghana and then there is an article written by Doctor Nana<br>本：我们有一本名叫“加纳”的杂志，有一篇文章是娜娜博士写的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It’s too close too close, too close okay oh I see the power unit and the CO2<br>凯：太近了，太近了，我们看见能量单元与CO2单元<br>[Benjamin]: Power unit and then the plasma and then Ghanaian scientist to use plasma technology for national development that is an article in,<br>本：能量单元，然后是“加纳科学家应该利用等离子体技术用于国家的发展”，这是里面的一篇文章<br>[Mr. Keshe]: As I said I put into the report most of the first nation will be behind they become table nation in what you achieve in African nations, Thank you very much we can see it. Let me explain Benjamin is embed in the Ghanaian spaceship institute in the final agreement which is getting signed and the Keshe foundation and the spaceship institute in Ghana’s university and atomic energy group will become part of the development research centre for Africa we are financing the whole progress and its part of what you donate by buying tools from the Keshe foundation, carry on show us please.<br>凯：就像我说的，我也报道过，大多数最先研究这项科技的国家会落在后面，非洲国家在很多方面会迎头赶上。很感谢，我们看见了。我解释一下，本杰明根植于加纳太空学院，正在与之签署最后的协议；凯史基金会与加纳大学的太空机构以及原子能团队会成为非洲研究中心的一部分，我们正在资助整个过程，你们从凯史基金会所购买的装置的一部分资金也会流向这方面。继续，请展示一下。<br>[Benjamin]: Okay so I hope you can see my screen on<br>本：好，我希望你们能看见我的屏幕<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes we can see the full page with mushrooms,<br>凯：是的，我们能看见整个页面，有蘑菇<br>[Benjamin]: so we have to, we have on the screen Keshe foundation agriculture and water treatment resource experiment and as you know we are enlisted inside the Ghana atomic energy commission so that is what we are doing now, okay. So I will a little bit about the geography of Ghana before we getting into what we have to say because they can build it from there on okay. So this is the geography of Ghana we have a total land area the space including water bodies is approximately 293460 kilometre square and Ghana lies within the geographical coordinates of latitude 8 degrees and longitude 2 degrees west and Ghana is a small nation but we are blessed with a lot of mineral resources which include gold diamond bauxite, silver, salt, limestone and then hydro power and also timber rubber and lastly we recently hit crude oil so they are mining the crude oil also and as you can see on the map on the western side of Ghana we are bounded we share boundaries with ivory coast or Corte D’voir and on the northern side we share boundaries with Burkina Faso and on the Eastern side its Togo and then we share boundary with the sea that is the gulf of Guinea or the Atlantic Ocean so that is who Ghana is strategically on the map on the African continent that’s where we are positioned.<br>凯：所以我们会在屏幕上展示凯史基金会农业与水处理实验，我们已经在加纳原子能委员会注册，所以那就是我们现在做的，好了。我们进入主题之前介绍一下加纳的地理，我们必须要说明一下，因为我们许多实验根基于这个地理条件。这是加纳的地理，全部国土包括水域，总面积在23.9460万平方千里，位于北纬8度，西经2度，加纳是一个小国家，但我们有丰富的矿物资源，包括金，钻石，铝土矿，银，盐，石灰石，还有水力发电，橡胶木，最近还开采了原油，在地图上我们可以看到在西边我们紧邻科特迪瓦，在北部是布基纳法索，在东边是多哥，在南边是大海，也就是几内亚湾，或者说是大西洋，这就是加纳在非洲大陆地图上的战略位置，也就是我们所处的位置 。<br>We have a lot of river bodies in Ghana as you can see on the map this was taken from the map of the world thanks to, thanks for using their resources. All the rivers you see starting from the Tain and Pra, some of the spellings are wrong it’s not Pru is Pra and then from that side to the Atlantic ocean most of the rivers are polluted you know are polluted because of gold mining and people are looking for alluvial gold. Alluvial gold means they dig under the beds of the river bed and where they are going about this is really an isle if you are in Ghana now that is the team here everybody is talking about the water pollution and it’s a huge problem here most of the places in Ghana don’t have proper have proper drinking water because of this manners and people spend so much to buy water to drink so I mean it has come at the right time and we are trying to do much more to get our act together right because I sent you an article I think some time ago about how the Ghana water with sewage cooperation is pumping of millions of dollars into buying of equipment and chemicals for treatment and they are complaining that even their machinery are running down because of the silt the trapping of silt in the rotating part of the machinery so its big problem here. So I am going to go to tell you about the pollution of water bodies in Ghana. We have 2 main sources of water pollution in Ghana the direct and the indirect pollution of the water body.<br>凯：我们在加纳有大量的河流，你能够在地图上看到，这幅图是来自世界地图，很感谢使用他们的资源 ，大部分河流发源于塔因河与普鲁河，是普纳河，不是普鲁河，那一边连着大西洋，大多数河流都遭到污染，因为挖金矿的原因，人们在寻求冲积金矿（沙金），冲积金矿就意味着要挖河床，他们去的地方通常是小岛。如果你在加纳，这是一个团队，每个人都在谈论水污染，在这里这是一个很大的问题，由于这些破坏资源的行为，在加纳大部分地方都没有合适的饮用水，人们花很多钱买水喝。所以这项科技来的正是时候，我们正努力做的更多从而让我们联合在一起走向正确的道路，我先前发给了你一篇论文是关于加纳为处理污水花费几百万美元购买设备，但他们在抱怨，因为淤泥阻塞了机器的发动机部分使得它运转不灵，所以这是一个很大的问题。我来告诉你们在加纳水污染的情况，在加纳我们有两条主要污染的河流，包括直接与间接的污染。<br> The direct means you know people pouring chemicals directly into this water bodies and people dumping the indirectly pollution, dumping things on the ground which eventually get shipped into the water bodies that is industrial pollution and the waste dumping people dump waste in the water bodies as well and the illegal mining in the water bodies. This is a huge thing you will see as the slide goes on  that it is a big problem here and the types of pollutants we have include organic and inorganic, radioactive and acid base in the pollution you know so all this is thrown into our river bodies as if nobody cares we are gradually seeing the effects now. This if from a picture from Joy news that I took before,  the before side you can see that the river is very clear and then after wards you know after see how the river look now it’s so muddy that is river Pra that is one of the rivers we treated and sent a to the lab for analysis.<br>本：直接的方式是人们直接将化学物质倒入河流中，间接的方式是人们将东西丢在地上，经过各种介质，最终进入到河流中，有工业污染，人们将废弃物倒入河流，以及在河流中非法的采矿。这是一个很大的事情，你会看见趋势在下降，在这里这是一个很大的问题，污染物的类型包括有机物与无机物，在污染物里面有放射性物质与酸性物质，这些都被流进河流中，好像没有人关心，我们现在逐渐看到了这些污染产生的影响。<br>这张图片是我以前从Joyfmnews拍摄的 ，在以前你可以看到河流是很清澈的，之后你看到河流变成污泥色，这是普纳河，是我们进行处理的一条河流，从里面取的水是送到实验室进行实验的样本。<br>Doctor Nash is here to explain the lab report himself so when it’s time he will come and then take over so now you can see now and before it’s very, very muddy, okay and this is how the people go about polluting our river this is an artificial way of dredging you know they have this man made or what you call it locally made kind of vessel on the river and they have rods deep rods which rips the dirt of the river and as it rips the sediments is pumped into what, a big vibrating to what they call the Shamfank or shamfing the local villages call it shamfing and they what do you call it win the gold from this artwork so that is exactly what dredging is.<br>本：纳什博士会介绍实验室的报告，时间到了，他会过来向我们介绍。你看到这条河流是十分浑浊的，这幅图就是人们如何污染河流的，这是人工的挖掘 ，这是人工制造的器具，有一个很深的长杆，用来撕裂河床，撕裂开的沉积物被泵抽取到，通过一个大的震荡器抽取到<br>Shamfing中，当地人叫shamfing。他们就从这个人工装置中获取金子。这就是挖掘的过程。<br>It’s a process of removing sediments from the bottom of water like lakes river dams and this is very important because most water waster are blocked so now it is, the water ways is not blocked but there are using the same technology that is using opening the dams to rake the river bed you know and in so doing they add other harmful chemicals like cyanide  mercury arsenic to the water to go about their activities so it end ups eventually poisoning, their man aim is to get this what you see that is a core of gold which Mr. Keshe has shown us how simple it is even to produce it in your own and in your own kitchen you know if you know what to do. So that is another stage of how the go about illegal mining they poor after collecting or milling they pour this muddy water and then it runs through this conveyor belt and the collect the clay and also they collect gold and then under goes another process.<br>本：这是一个将沉积物从河床中移走的过程，河床就像湖水或江河的水坝，是很重要的，因为它可以挡住多数的水里的废弃物，而现在河床被破坏不能起到阻挡的作用，他们在使用同样的技术来打开大坝，掘开河床，<br>在这样做的时候，他们将氰化物，汞，砷这些其他的有害化学物质加入到河流中，进行他们的活动。这样最后造成有毒有害的影响，他们主要的目的就是为了得到这个 。这是一个金子的核心，而凯史先生已经展示过如何在厨房简单的制作出来，如果你知道如何做的话。这幅图是获取金子的另一个阶段 ，磨洗，他们污泥水倒在传送带上，他们收集干净的金子，然后进行下一个程序。<br>This is another picture which I got and you can see them when you travel to the eastern region to collect the Brim river we saw a lot I mean you can even, you even here on the river side these people on their boat with the dredging machine and they don’t care you know they don’t care about anybody and the people have to buy a lot of what do you call it water to feed they cannot even feed from the river or drink from the river so the effect in the nose this source of pollution give us dangerous ramifications you know it will end up getting poisonous drinking water and destruction of food chain that mean when the pollutants get into the soil it end up being affected let me pick fish for example the fish end up becoming extinct and when man cannot feed on it he also gradually extinct he become extinct himself through the source of pollution and it have negative impact on the ecology most trees at the river banks are dying in those days when you get to drink one fisher man I met a the banks was telling how busy the place used to be and so on so we can see that it also impact on the ecology and it also has drastic or catastrophic weather patterns and that is another effect so then as I said extinction of aquatic life forms.<br>本：这是我得到的另一个图片，当我们旅行到东部地区收集布里姆河流的样本水时，我们看见很多，即使在这里河的一边，人们在他们的船上利用挖掘机器进行挖掘，他们毫不关心其他人，人们购买大量的水来供养自己，他们不能从河流中取水或者饮用，这些河流的污染给我们造成危险的影响，会给饮用水带来毒性以及摧毁食物链，这意味着当污染物质进入到土壤中，最终会被影响。 我拿鱼举例，鱼最终会绝迹，当人们不能够获取鱼来食用，他也会逐渐的灭亡，通过污染源人们也会逐渐使自己毁灭；它在生态上也会造成消极的影响，在河岸的大多数树木会死亡，我遇见一个在河岸的渔夫，他告诉我这个地方以前是多么茂密丛生，所以我们可以看见这给生态造成多大的消极影响。同样，它会造成剧烈或者灾难性的天气模式。还有另一个影响，就像我说的，会造成水栖生命形式的灭绝。<br>I asked him so how do you live fisherman the fisherman at the river side he said the fishes are gone so it’s very difficult now you have to go upstream to get this aquatic life  form to feed on and then we also have seen it’s in the news that there are a lot of water borne diseases in this area and cancers different types of cancers they are common in this area Brim Osa and Nan a lot diseases are springing up because of the pollution or the contamination in this river and in the end we get a high economic cost in water treatment that means like I said before the water works cooperation or the Ghana sewage cooperation have to spend huge amounts of money in purchase of machinery and equipment so that is having a negative impact on the economy also we can go on to say more and more in the end we can see it can also have negative effects on human and animal reproduction cycle because of the mercury you can say I am not drinking from the water and you can buy treated water but you still feed from the land which at the same time you eat from the polluted soil so you will have the consequence at the same time so I don’t want to go political. Okay they are other sources apart from this pollution there are people who deliberately pollute these waters like as you can see in the picture this man who has slaughtered a goat and is washing the blood and everything in the river body.<br>本：我问这个渔夫，如何生存呢？这个河边的渔夫说，鱼已经绝迹了，所以这是很困难的，你要到河流上游去寻找水生生物来供养自己，同时，我们还看见，这已经在新闻里面讲到，在这个区域有大量的水传疾病，以及有不同类型的癌症，在布里姆奥萨以及南地区很普遍，由于河水中的污染，大量的疾病如雨后春笋一样出现；最终我们也要进行水污染处理，从而付出经济上的代价，就像我说的，加纳水污染处理花费了大量的金钱购买机器设备，所以这在经济上有一个消极的影响，还有更多的影响我们都能说出来，最后我们看见，汞污染会给人与动物的繁殖机制造成消极影响。你能够说，我不喝河里的水，直接买净化的水，但是你还是被土地所供养，同时你吃土地上生产的食品，所以你还是面临相同的结果，我不想要进行政治上的话题。除了这个污染，还有其他的污染源，人们在刻意的污染这些水，就像你在这幅图上看到的，这个人在宰杀一头山羊，他在用河水洗血以及其他 。<br>So I mean this can generate what do you call it biofecal content and E.coli as well because you, I will show you another picture where by this guy is still washing the internal part of the animal inside the river body so now you see he is washing now you can see he is washing the inner part of the animal in the river body this is manmade pollution. Another picture is a journalist covering the whole activity you can see him pointing in that direction they are washing the internal part into this river body so. In the end we have come to, when I came around I saw that it was a huge problem so one day I went to the office of Doctor Nana and we sat and then we said we can do something about it but I need some quantity of water of this polluted water to start with so we go some samples from Brim we got some samples from river Pra and then on Fin and then we started the treatment so we started using gans for those of you here today who are new to our technology gans is simply a new state of matter which is Gas in Atomic Nano State of GANS for short and it was introduced by the speaker you heard earlier my boss M.T Keshe and this new  state of matter has different characteristics which give engineers and scientists the ability to do many things.<br>凯：所以我的意思是这会在河水中你们所说的生物排泄物，大肠杆菌，我会给你们展示另一张图片，这个人在用河水洗动物的内脏，这是人为的污染。这个图片是一个记者采访整个过程，你可以看见他所指的方向，他们正在河水里洗动物的内脏 。最后，我们来到，当我四处考察，我看见一个巨大的问题，所以一天，我来到娜娜博士的办公室，我们坐下来，我说在这方面我们可以做一些事情，要开始，首先我需要一定量的受污染的河流里的样本水，所以我们从布里姆河，普纳河，以及芬河取了样本水，我们就开始了处理的过程，我们开始使用甘斯。对于今天在这里的对这项科技还很陌生的你们中的一些人来说 ，甘斯是一种新的物质状态 ，是气体处于原子纳米态的甘斯状态，这是由我的老板凯史先生引进介绍的，这种新的物质状态具有不同的性能能够赋予工程师与科学家进行各方面事情的能力。<br>Gans are nano plus atomic plasma and they have both gravitational and magnetic field if you were here during my lecture here you will know what I mean by gravitational and magnetic field and through this we can do a lot of things you know in improvement of the in the treatment of water and other things in the area of agriculture so as you can see the first picture is CO2 I know many of you know but for the sake of people who are in we just how and this is copper oxide and CH3 I have them sit right in front of me here so it can go around for those who have not seen it before you can pass it around and then we go on those who are here so I am rushing through to finish okay so if we are going to treat this polluted water we have so far done different configurations in the treatment of this polluted waters the one we did on Pra we us the CO2 and the copper oxide so in a nutshell these are the things that will be needed for real treatment you know if somebody want to replicate it we need a contaminated water we need containers we need measuring flask or a beaker and we need a the material the gans the CO2 of the copper oxide in the liquid form of the powder form and then if you want to go extra you can use another form of configuration that is the nano layer which I will later show you also and then you always protect yourself because you always protect yourself because you don’t know what is inside the water and we need syringes the normal medical syringes to pull our ganses so these are in effect what you need to in this experiment we divide in order to check what is happening in the treated and the untreated water we divide into 2 groups so we have the control group and we have the treatment group. So those of you who are not chemistry inclined or scientifically inclined I have defined what control group is. It used as a baseline measure that mean you put it check what is happening in your treatment.<br>本：甘斯是纳米原子态的等离子体，它们同时具有引力场与磁力场，如果你在这里，听过我的演讲，你会明白我指的磁引力场说的是什么，通过甘斯，我们能够做很多事情，在水的处理与改善方面，以及农业的其他领域。你能够看见这第一个图片是CO2甘斯， ，我知道你们中人知道，但是对于要涉入这项科技的人来说，我们需要展示出来。中间是氧化铜甘斯，还有CH3甘斯，在这里它们三个就放在我的面前，这是给那些没有看见过的人看的，你们可以再传给别人看。我们继续，很快的浏览一遍； ，我们将要处理这个污水，在处理这个污染的水的过程中，我们做了不同的配置，在处理普纳的水污染中，我们用了CO2甘斯与氧化铜甘斯，简言之，如果有人想要复制的话，这是真正的水处理所必备的。我们需要污染的水，我们需要容器，量瓶或烧杯，我们需要液体或者粉末的CO2甘斯或者氧化铜甘斯，如果你想要更进一步，你可以使用另一种配置，就是纳米涂层，过后我也会向你们展示；你要总是保护自己，因为你不知道水里面有什么，我们需要普通的医用注射器，用来吸取甘斯，这就是你所需要的。在实验中，我们将其分为处理的水与没有处理的水，这样是为了弄清楚在处理后发生了什么，所以我们将它分为2组：对照组与治疗组。对于那些没有化学或科学基础的人来说，我定义了对照组是什么，它是作为一个基线测量，用来检测在你另外所处理的样本中发生了什么。<br>The content of the control container is identical to all other container with the exception that is does not receive the treatment or the experimental manipulation that the equipment container undergoes and we have the treatment group. The treatment group is a container which undergoes the manipulation of the treatment process so that is the treatment  in the group and then the control group so these are the samples that we had initially and from river Pra and then the river Offin, the Germans if the Germans is there it’s not Offin, its Offin and then<br>本： 这个控制容器里面的东西是与其他容器里面的东西相同的，不接受治疗容器所经过的处理或者人为的实验。治疗组经过人为处理的过程，所以这就是控制组与治疗组。 这是最初来自普纳以及奥芬的样本水，不是德国的奥弗恩，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We explain what we know the Germans just wait you will be…<br>凯：解释一下你知道关于德国的事情<br>[Benjamin]: Okay Offin in German Offin is e it’s not I Offin is to open<br>本：好，奥芬在德国是奥弗恩，中间是e，不是i，一个开音<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay let me explain that people know they know you are Benjamin only, let me explain we should have done it at the beginning that is what he goes back to German language. Benjamin is BSc graduate from Ghana University<br>凯：好，让我解释一下，人们只是知道你是本杰明，让我解释一下为什么他提到德国的语言，本杰明是毕业于加纳大学的理学学士<br>[Benjamin]: No MSc<br>本：不，理学硕士<br>[Mr. Keshe]: MSc you received from can you explain to us your background.<br>凯：理学硕士，你是从，你能向我们解释一下你的背景吗？<br>[Benjamin]: I studied in Germany initially at the university of applied sciences there and then I moved there to Austria to do my masters in information technology management at the university of applied sciences Vinannosta that is where I got my masters from and then initially I was trying to get myself in the IEA to work with the IEA because of my interest in atomic nuclear physics so I applied there I was one of the 2 candidates that were selected but politics so I have to wait for about 8 months and there was no reply and finally the reply came and then Mr. Keshe also came in and said I want you to work for work for me so I just picked the opportunity to come to Ghana and then work for Keshe foundation so that is in a nutshell a small background<br>本：最初我在德国的大学里学习应用科学，然后我搬到澳大利亚，完成信息技术管理的硕士学位，然后我想要在国际能源署工作，因为我的兴趣在原子能物理方面，所以我申请了那里的职位，我是2名候选人之一，这个候选人的选择是政治性的，所以我得等待8个月，没有回复，最后回复来了，凯史先生来了，并且说我想要你为我工作，所以我就选择了这个机会来到加纳，为凯史基金会工作，这就是一个简单的背景介绍<br>[Mr. Keshe]: But you originally got your degree from Ghana<br>凯：但是你最初是从加纳得到你的学位的<br>[Benjamin]: I originally got a degree from Ghana before I came to Germany and then from Germany I went to Austria<br>本：在我来到德国之前我是从加纳得到学位的，然后我从德国来到澳大利亚<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So you are a highly qualified person to do this job and that’s why you present your technology so beautifully, he is born and bred in Ghana and he has gone back home to serve his nation. This is what you do in Keshe foundation we see now the next presentation same with Kenya and we see in with Alex in Nigeria and we have a gentleman which goes back highly educated back to Kenya in the coming time thank you very much carry on.<br>凯：所以你是一个高学历的人在做这个事情，这是为什么你将这项科技做的这么出色，他出生于并被养育于加纳，现在他回到家为他的国家服务。这就是你在凯史基金会所做的，我们会在下一个展示的国家—肯尼亚看到同样的事情，我们会看到阿历克斯在尼日利亚的工作。接下来我们会看到一个高学历的人同样返回到肯尼亚。很感谢，继续。<br>[Benjamin]: So in the treatment steps both the control treatment container were rinsed with about 25ml with the polluted water to set them because a scientist will question you did you set them at the same time so we set them both containers used for the treatments we cleans it with about 25ml of the polluted water to set it off okay after we rinse is meaning we poor the water away after you know after shaking it large setting the bottles we poor them away and then we measure equal amounts of the polluted water in both container okay and then the control container was closed and then we put label and then we labelled it the name of the river the date and then the time you know of the experiment so that we can actually do statistics and graphing on it when the time come to show the impact and what we found in the water and so on.<br>本：我们在处理的阶段，我们将控制组的容器与治愈组的容器都用25ML的有污染的水漂洗，这样来设置他们，使它们处于同样的状态，因为科学家会质问你：你在同一时间设置它们（使之处于同一状态）了吗？所以我们将两个容器都进行了设置，我们将25ML的污染的水清洗了这个治愈组的容器，来设置它们。在我们清洗后，摇晃后，我们就设置了瓶子，然后倒出去；然后我们将同样量的污染的水倒入两个瓶子里；然后对照组的容器就被封住了，在瓶子上标注着河流，日期，实验时间。这样我们就能够收集数据，做图表，以便到时候展示出影响以及我们在水里所发现的现象。<br>So after we introduce 7ml of gans into the treatment container so that is what we did and then we left if off that is immediately after the application of the gans so A is the treatment as you can see A is the treatment container and B is the control and we are using we bought it special glasses because we want to identify the color coded one is green and the other is orange, orange color so that we can easily also labelling them it is good when you are witting something when you are writing something on it and then after this is the treatment after 24 hours we can see that the water has sediment the upper part is more clearer than the control the control still remain almost the same although they are sediments it’s still you know the stability, turbidity is to explain to the lay man the clarity of the water the suspended particles in the water if you shine a light through it how it can get to the other side you can see that the water is more clearer than the one that we are used treatment so that is it and this is the CO2 treatment let’s see the copper oxide. The copper oxide looks more clearer and each and every time it give me a clearer turbidity and then the springs but I don’t have the springs to show today but on the table what we may show life how the whole thing is done is also, we also some springs the nano IS treatment to show also if time permit us okay. And to I leave the report now for Doctor Nash to come and then take over.<br>本：然后我们将7ML的甘斯放入治愈组的容器瓶，这就是我们所做的，在放入甘斯后，然后我们立刻让它们静置；  A是治疗组，B是对照组，我们购买了特殊的玻璃，以便我们能很好的观察颜色，一个是绿色，一个是橘色，这样就能够很好的做标签以及写下一些东西；这是24小时后治疗的结果 ，我们看见水有了沉积物，相比对照组，它的上层变得更清澈了，而对照组还是原来的样子，尽管他们是沉积物，但有浊度的区别，浊度用来解释水的清晰度，在水中悬浮的颗粒的程度，如果你射出一道光看这道光如何穿过去到另一边，你可以看见水比先前变得清澈了，这是CO2甘斯的治疗结果。让我们看看氧化铜甘斯的治疗结果 ，用氧化铜甘斯治愈后显得更清澈了，每一次它都给我一个很清晰的浊度。而弹簧，今天我们没有弹簧治疗效果的展示，我们会展示整个过程是如何完成的，我们也有一些纳米弹簧治疗的结果可以展示，如果时间允许的话。接下来让纳什博士给我们报告。<br>[Rick]: I think we lost them<br>瑞克：我认为我们与他们失去了连接<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Stay online don’t move let them come back. This is the report we seen in the couple of days of days ago sent to us we have a copy here in case any anything happens but Doctor Banner of the space ship institute with the national nuclear research institute of Ghana. Yeah so as we see the we wait for them to come back we bring them back on we were expecting problems in the communication with Ghana so as you seen the test it done on very scientific conditions on the laboratories of the atomic energy authorities of the Ghana and we see the same kind of collaboration and cooperation now with different part of the Keshe foundation worldwide this is what we emphasize on we invest heavily in Africa. Is he there?<br>凯：保持在线，不要动，让他们连接上。这是几天前他们发送给我们的报告，我们有一个复印件，以防有任何意外发生，是由加纳的太空船机构与加纳原子能研究机构合作主导的。我们等待他们重新连接上，一旦他们连接上，我们就可以把他们带回来，我们与加纳在网络连接上有一些问题。所以你可以看见测试是在加纳原子能机构的实验室中很科学的条件下进行的，我们也看见不同的政府在与世界各地的凯史基金会进行合作，这就是我们强调的，我们在非洲投资很大。他在吗？<br>[Benjamin]: Yeah I am back please<br>本：是的，我回来了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes carry on show us, we have just seen the report<br>凯：好，继续，展示给我们看，我们刚才看到这个报告<br>[Benjamin]: yeah on the, can you see now so with the water full water quality treatment…<br>本：是的，你能看见吗。所以对于水的质量的处理<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Who is this please I think the speaker has changed<br>凯：是谁在说话，我认为换了一个人<br>[Nash]: I am Nash<br>纳什：我是纳什<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Doctor Nash, we have a doctor Nash<br>凯：纳什博士，我们的纳什博士<br>[Nash]: Yeah so for the water quality test we did physical<br>纳什：是的，关于水的质量的测试，我们用物理的方法<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We need screen share on the document please, hello? Hello? I think yes but do they have set up a presentation power point we have to follow the, we don’t have the PowerPoint presentation do we?<br>凯：我们需要在文件上分享屏幕，喂？我认为他们设置了一个幻灯片的展示，我们必须跟上，我们没有幻灯片的展示，对吗？<br>[Rick]: Is that he I go 2 things is that the PRA and Offin test results and<br>瑞克：是关于，我有2个东西，是关于PRA和奥弗恩的测试结果<br>[Mr. Keshe]: even if you are there you don’t need to share your screen you can go on the voice only, we can show it that it doesn’t put pressure on the bandwidth<br>凯：本杰明，如果你在那里，你不需要分享你的屏幕，你只需要讲话即可，我们能够展示，这样就不会给带宽造成压力<br>[Rick]: Is that the report<br>瑞克：我们有这个<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes we go your report Doctor Nash we have the results in the screen<br>凯：是的，我们有你的报告，纳什博士，你能够继续讲话，我们在屏幕上有这个测试结果<br>[Nash]:So with the water sample analysis we did the physical parameters nutrients and then we did trace metals for the physical parameters we did pH temperature conductivity total dissolved solids total suspended solid alkalinity and stability alkalinity turbidity apparent color and true color we compare it to WHO  and then Ghana standard authority guidelines for drinking water for example the Offin river treated pH was 7.27 then the Offin control was 7,67 then with the Pra treated its 7,73 and then the control 7.55 so when we compare these with the guide line values for drinking water WHO and Ghnana stand authority it between 6.5 to 8.5 and then for Ghana standard authority is 6.0 to 8.5 so we compare the values that we got from the analysis with that of WHO and then Ghana standard authority in conductivity which is in micro Semmens per centimetre for the Offin treated we got 357.g whilst the control we got 268.5 then for the Pra treated we got 2325 and then the control is 178.2 the range according to WHO is 500 -700 micro Semmens per centimetre then it follows due to a total dissolved solid also in milligrams per litre we Offin  treated its 179.3 whilst the control is 134.65 for Pra of 1164.45 then the control is 88.9 the range is coming to WHO and Ghana standard authority is 1000 then the total suspend solid the Offin treated is 210 the control is 35 whilst the Pra treated is 230 the control is 5 and then the guide line is 5 and for alkalinity the Offin treated is 45 the control is 75 and the Pra is 65 for the treated and the control is 105 the range is 200 according to WHO and Ghana standard authority, the Turbidity also in formal attenuation unit its 200 for the Offin treated then control then Pra treated is 226 the control is 4 the range according to Who and Ghana standard authority is 5 then we come to salinity which is parts per trillion, Offin is 0.2 the control is 0.1 the Pra treated is 1.1 then the control is 0.1 we don’t have the WHO and Ghana’s standard authority’s levels at the moment then the apparent color which we also measure in platinum cobalt unit the apparent color is the color of the water as it was presented to the lab and the true color is after it had been filtered through 0.45mm Whitman filter paper so the apparent color is 220 for the fin treated and then Offin control is 20 for Pra its 50 then then control is 1 the guide line value is 25 and then to 100 so when we come to the true color which has been filtered from 220 as apparent the true color came down to 15 and then Offin control dropped to 3 then the Pra control from 50 it dropped to 5 but the control from 1 dropped to 0 then for the nutrient analysis we did Fluoride, chloride, sodium, potassium, total hardness nitrates phosphates and then sulphates they are all in the milligram per litre unit the fluoride for the Offin treated is 0.015 and the control is 0.011 Pra is 0.001 and then the control is 0.013 the guide line value is 1.5 according to WHO and according to Ghana standard authority is 1.0-1.5<br>纳什：所以关于样本水的分析，我们做了物理参数、营养元素以及微量元素的测试。关于物理参数，我们做了PH、温度、电导性、固体溶解总量、悬浮固体总量、盐度、碱度、浊度以及表色与真色，我们将它与世界卫生组织和加纳权威指导的饮用水标准作对照。比如奥弗恩治疗组样本水的PH是7.27，对照组是7.67；普纳治疗组的样本水的PH是7.73，对照组是7.55，所以我们将这些与标准饮用水的指导参数作比较，世界卫生组织的指导标准是在6.5-8.5之间，加纳权威指导标准是在6.0-8.5之间，所以我们与来自世界卫生组织和加纳权威机构的指导标准作对比，在导电率上，单位是微西门子每厘米，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是357.5，控制组的样本水是268.5，在普纳河的治疗组的样本水是2325，对照组是178.2，世界卫生组织的标准范围是500-700微西门子每厘米；固体溶解总量，单位是每升毫克，奥弗恩河治疗组样本水是179.3，对照组是134.65，普纳河治疗组样本水是1164.45，对照组是88.9，世界卫生组织和加纳权威机构的标准都是1000；悬浮固体总量，奥弗恩河治疗组样本水是210，对照组是35，普纳河治疗组样本水是230，对照组是5，指导标准也都是5；碱度，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是45，对照组是75，普纳河治疗组是65，对照组是105，根据世界卫生组织和加纳权威机构的标准都是200；对于浊度，奥弗恩河治疗组样本水是200，对照组是32，普纳河治疗组是226，对照组是4，根据世界卫生组织以及加纳权威机构的标准都是5；对于盐度，万亿分之一，奥弗恩河治疗组样本水是0.2，对照组是0.1，<br>普纳治疗组是1.1，对照组是0.1，目前还没有世界卫生组织与加纳权威机构的标准数据；对于表色，是用的是铂钴单位，表色是水的颜色，被呈送到实验室，真色是经过0.45MM怀特曼滤纸过滤后的颜色，所以奥弗恩河治疗组样本水是220，对照组是20，普纳河治疗组是20，对照组是1，世界卫生组织的指导线是25，加纳指导线是100；经过过滤后的真色，奥弗恩河治疗组从表色的220降到15，对照组则降到3，普纳河治疗组从50降到5，对照组从1降到0。对于营养元素分析，我们分析了氟，氯，钠，钾，硝酸盐，磷酸盐，硫酸盐、总硬度，单位都是毫克每升，对于氟元素，奥弗恩河治疗组是0.015，对照组是0.011，普纳河治疗组是0.001，对照组是0.013，世界卫生组织的指导线是1.5，加纳权威机构的指导线是1.0-1.5<br>then for chloride the Offin treated we had 9.99 but the control has 48.98 then the Pra treated we had 586.81but the control is 28.99 the guide line value is from 250 to 1000 and the sodium for the Offin treated is 13.2 the control is 17.9 the Pra treated is 85.7 plus the control is 16.8 the guideline value is 200. The potassium the Offin treated is 1.5 the control is 2.5 the Pra treated is 6.5 while the Pra control is 1.0 the WHO guideline is 30 then the total hardness for Offin treated its 52 Offin control is 65 then the Pra treated is 48 whilst the Pra control is 53 the WHO and Ghana standard authority guideline level is 500 then we come to nitrate as N also in milligrams per litre its 0 for Offin treated its 0.406 while Offin control is  0.318 the Pra treated is 0.002 Pra the control is 2.066 the levels is between is between 10 and 45 then phosphate is 0.034 for Offin treated then Offin control is 0.683 the Pra treated is 0.012 the control for Pra is 0.218 we do not have the both WHO and Ghana standard authority levels as at now then for sulphate we have 2.5101 for Offin treated then Offin control 2.0089 the Pra treated is 0.014 whilst the control is 1.021 the guide line values is from 250 to 500 then we did trace metals for the trace metals we did total iron total manganese total copper and total zinc using the atomic absorption spectrum which also the AAs we have they are also in milligrams per litre for Offin treated we had for iron 0.217 for the treated and then of the Offin control is 0.420 the Pra treated is 0.203 while the Pra control is 0.501. The guide line value of 0.3. Then manganese its 0.010 for Offin treated then 0.031 for the control while Pra treated is 0.027 with its control 0.040 the guide line value is 0.5. Copper is less than 0.003 that is below the dictation limit of copper using the AAS for treated Offin and the Offin control for Pra treated it’s also below the dictation limit which is below 0.003 for both treated and control. Then WHO value if 1.0 then we come to total zinc Offin treated is 0.039 and it control is 0.077 then Pra treated is 0.031 then Pra control is 0.072 the guideline value is 3. So these are the analytical report of the samples received from the Offin River and Pra River.<br>纳什：对于氯元素，奥弗恩河治疗组样本水是9.99，但对照组是48.98，普纳河治疗组是586.81，对照组是28.99，世界卫生组织的指导线是250到1000；对于钠含量，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是13.2，对照组是17.9，普纳河治理组是85.7，对照组是16.8，指导线是200；钾含量，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是1.5，对照组是2.5，普纳河治疗组是6.5，而普纳对照组是1.0，世界卫生组织指导线是30；对于总硬度，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是52，对照组是65，普纳河治疗组是48，对照组是53，世界卫生组织与加纳权威指导水平都是500；对于硝酸盐，单位也是毫克每升，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是0.406，对照组是0.318，普纳河治疗组是0.002，对照组是2.066，指导线是在10-45之间；对于磷酸盐，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是0.034，对照组是0.683，普纳河治疗组是0.012，对照组是0.218，现在还没有世界卫生组织以及加纳权威机构在这个数据上的指导线；对于硫酸，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是2.5101，对照组是2.0089，普纳河治疗组是0.014，对照组是1.021，指导线在250-500。我们做了微量元素的分析，我们检测了铁含量，锰含量，铜含量，锌含量的检测，我们用的是原子吸收光谱仪，也叫做AAS，单位也是毫克每升，对于铁含量，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是0.217，对照组是0.420，普纳河治疗组是0.203，普纳河对照组是0.501，指导线是0.3；然后是锰含量，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是0.010，对照组是0.031，普纳河治疗组是0.027，对照组是0.040，指导线是0.5；对于含铜量，奥弗恩河治疗组与对照组的样本水都是低于0.003，这是低于使用AAS铜含量读数的限制，普纳河治疗组与对照组都是低于0.003，低于使用AAS铜含量读数的限制，世界卫生组织的标准时1.0；然后是锌含量，奥弗恩河治疗组的样本水是0.039，对照组是0.077，普纳河治疗组是0.031，对照组是0.072，指导线是3，所以这就是来自奥弗恩河与普纳河的样本水的数据分析报告。<br>[Benjamin]: So in effect these are, we have not really completed with the findings it’s an ongoing thing we still need to find our way because they are other things to do like to be down the salinity level because the salinity level has also influenced the total suspended liquid and the total dissolves solid so we are trying to do more to refine the way to get down these level but according to doctor Nash in the lab he told me this can be taken or it can be used because most of the well-built does not even pass even what do you call it this test so<br>本：事实上我们还没有完成在进行中的研究发现，因为我们还需要找到方法可以让盐度水平下降，因为盐度水平影响总悬浮液与总溶解固体量，我们在试着找到更多改善的方法使得盐度水平下降，根据纳什博士的说法，他在实验室告诉我说，这个治愈后的水可以使用，因为大多数的好的元素的没有被测试过滤掉。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you explain to us or let doctor Nash explain to us what has it changed we need it’s all better they are all experts can we understand what are change in the water what is the condition of the water? Hello<br>凯：你能向我们解释一下吗，或者让纳什博士向我们解释，发生了什么改变，你们是专家，我们能够理解在水中发生了什么改变吗，水的状态是什么样的？<br>[Nash]: Yeah hello<br>纳什：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you enlighten us with your knowledge and what is added what is changed is the water has changed for consumption does the water need one week to be done then we take it to the next step<br>凯：你能用你的知识教导一下我们吗，在水中发生了什么改变，水已经发生了可以饮用的改变吗？或者还需要对水做什么才可以饮用？<br>[Nash]: Yeah in summary with the water the treated there has been an improvement on the treatment than on the treated water which is the control except the salinity level which is especially for the Pra treated water which is 1.1 than is on the higher side according to the previous analysis we done<br>纳什：是的，总的来说，经过治愈的水比对照组有明显的改善，除了盐度水平，尤其是普纳河治疗组的水达到1.1，相比我们以前做的实验分析来说比较高<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay can I ask you 2 questions? Because the gans the comes through the salt water created through the salt water was the water washed thoroughly the gansed was washed thoroughly before you added to it?<br>凯：好的，我能问2个问题？因为甘斯来自于盐水，是在盐水中创造的，在你们加入甘斯之前，甘斯完全被清洗过了吗？<br>[Benjamin]: Mr. Keshe the gans was not totally washed what I have also discovered<br>本：凯史先生，甘斯没有完全被清洗，我也刚发现<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can you excuse me, Benjamin can you explain to us what was the condition of the water gans you used for that test experiment.<br>凯：不好意思，本杰明，你能向我们解释一下你用在那个实验的甘斯水的状况吗？<br>[Benjamin]: It was taken directly from the setup the gans setup<br>本：它是直接取自甘斯的生成的状态<br>[Mr. Keshe]: did you wash it with the distilled water was it washed?<br>凯：你用蒸馏水洗过吗？<br>[Benjamin]: It was not washed because at that time I didn’t have distilled water I didn’t also want to use tap water because the tap water have traces of mineral in it and I don’t want to influence the outcome<br>本：没有清洗甘斯，因为那时我没有蒸馏水，我也没有使用自来水，因为自来水有矿物微量元素，我不想要影响结果。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So Doctor Nash the salinity can be explained because we use salt water to produce the gans material, putting that aside what is the water is this water drinkable or is this water usable or what does it need to be done for it to become usable.<br>凯：所以纳什博士，这个盐度水平可以解释为我们是使用盐水来生产甘斯材料，把这个因素放在一边，这个水是可以饮用的吗，还是我们需要做什么让它变得可以饮用<br>[Benjamin]: It can be used except the color which need to be filtered it because when you look at the apparent color its 220 which is far above the recommended guideline value so if the water can be filter then it can even with the Offin treated after the filtration it’s still 15 which is more than the guideline value which is 5 it means it need to go through further filtration before it can at least if it’s before<br>本：能够使用，除了颜色需要过滤一下，因为你看这个表色是220，是远高于所推荐的指导线，所以如果这个水能够被过滤，然后就能够被饮用；即使是奥弗恩河治疗组样本水的真色也是15，高于指导线5，这就意味着在饮用前需要做进一步的过滤，如果是在…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask you a question because I had this same with another test trial did you take the water from the top separating the residual or did you test it with the residual in the container?<br>凯：我能问你一个问题吗，因为我们做的另外一个测试也是遇到同样的情况，你是取沉淀物上面的水呢还是你测试的是容器里面的沉淀物？<br>[Nash]: In the container we took from the top that is with the treated sample we took from the top<br>纳什：我们是取的容器里上面的水，那是被治疗的样本水，我们取上面的水<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So there were no residual in it<br>凯：所以在里面没有残留物<br>[Nash]: No there wasn’t<br>纳什：没有残留物<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you explain to us why then we see a clear bottle on the left but the what you call it but the river untreated is still so mud why do we see it but in the apparent color and the true color we don’t see it in the test result<br>凯：你能向我们解释一下，为什么我们在左边的瓶子里看见清澈的水，但是未经处理过的河水还是如此浑浊，在表色与真色的测试结果里面我们看不到这样的说明。<br>[Nash]: Yeah you realize that the apparent color the values are quite high but with the true color which after the filtration the value drops especially for the Offin River which is for the apparent is 220 then it drops to 15 which means there is still room for improvement<br>纳什：是的，你看到这个指导线很高，但经过过滤后的真色，指导线下降了，尤其是奥弗恩河治疗组样本水的表色是220，降到真色的15，这意味着还有改善的空间<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask you another question why do we see this is something I would like to know because it helps the other authorities who will use this or they are going to consider to use this, why do we see a higher apparent color after treatment but we see a clarity in the water after the treatment?<br>凯：我能够问你另一个问题吗，为什么我们看见，这是我想要了解的一些事情，因为这可以帮助其他使用甘斯或者准备考虑使用甘斯的权威机构，为什么在治疗后我们看见一个更高的表色，而治疗后的水却比较清澈？<br>[Nash]: The clarity of color after the treatment<br>纳什：治疗后清澈的颜色…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah when you look at the 2 bottles one which is treated it’s the clear water we see but on the right side which is not treated it’s still yellowish orangish color but when you do your test the results show totally different this is what I wanted to know how come the water is clear after treatment but when you do the test it says the color looks to be more muddier or not clear as is shows in the container because the visual observation does not comply with the data on the paper visually we see because I look at your turbidity as well its 200 and 32 226 and 4 but when you look at the bottles in front of us in the test cases the bottle is very clear and the other water is river untreated is not very clear but when you show us the data the true data does not match with the visual observation where it say apparent color is 220 you have filter it to get it better where in a parallel control was 1 now its 0 and then the other one is 50 becomes 5<br>凯：是的，当你看这个2个瓶子，一边是经过治愈过的水，是清晰的水，但在另一边是没有经过治愈的水，是黄色，橘色的颜色，但是你做了你的测试后显示的结果却是完全不同的，这就是我想要知道的，经过治疗后的水是如何变得清澈的，但是当你做了你的测试却显示这个容器里的水的颜色是更浑浊的，不清澈的，因为视觉上的观察与所测试报告的数据不相符，因为同样看你的浊度，是奥弗恩河治疗组样本水是200，对照组是32，普纳河治疗组是226，对照组是4；但当你看在我们面前的测试的瓶子，瓶子是很清澈的，而另一个未经过治疗的样本水不是很清澈的，但是你给我们展示的数据与我们观察到的现象不相符，报告上说表色是220，你将它过滤后就变得好些，普纳河对照组是1，过滤后变为0，治疗组是50，过滤后变为5<br>[somebody]: What does it actually mean apparent color and true color maybe it means something different<br>某人：表色与真色各是什么意思，可能它们所指不同<br>[Nash]: The apparent color is the color of the water as presented to the lab that is before filtration then the true colour is after filtration<br>纳什：表色是在实验室里展现出的水的颜色，是在过滤前；真色是在过滤后<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes I understand that but what doesn’t come to visual observation the colour of the water is very clear we see it in the bottle<br>凯：是的，我理解，但是报告数据与我们观察到的不一样，在瓶子里的颜色是很清澈的<br>[Nash]: In the green bottle<br>纳什：在绿色的瓶子里<br>[Mr. Keshe]: In the green one but when you test it doesn’t confirm that why, is it the possibility that the figures have been misplaced.<br>凯：在绿色里面。但是你测试后却不能与之相匹配，为什么？有可能这个数据时被错误置换了吗？<br>[Nash]: The treated, yes you have to do it means that the treated should rather be 20 and then control…okay<br>纳什：这个治疗组的，是的，你必须要做的，这意味着这个治疗组的应该是20，这个对照组的….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The figures with the visual observation don’t add up I think in the this process figures are in the wrong column if I am correct or you have to enlighten us<br>凯：这个数据与我们观察到的不相符，我认为在这个过程中数据被用在错误的一栏上，如果我是正确的话，或者你来教一下我们<br>[Nash]: yeah we will have to do further test on it it looks like the topographical something it should be 20and then the control should 220 and<br>纳什：是的，我们要做进一步的测试，它看起来是地形的数据，治疗组应该是20，对照组应该是220<br>[Mr. Keshe]: and the 50 and one should be in the same position<br>凯：并且这个50也应该是在一样的位置<br>[Nash]: Yes<br>纳什：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes it shows a huge difference and then we see with the Turbidity the same it was 200 now its 32 when it was 226 now its 4 this brings a lot of things in line is it possible that you could check the data and the come back to us in next week on 2 confirm the test and you have the data correctly what is you put those in line correctly would this show us that would you drink this water after treated<br>凯：是的，这显示了很大的不同，我们看这个浊度也是一样的，奥弗恩河治疗组是200，对照组是32，普纳河治疗组是226，对照组是4，在同样的方向上都成这样了；有可能，你可以检查一下这个数据，然后在下个星期二教学中联系我们，确认一下这个数据，把数据校对正确，当你将数据校对准确后，这是否意味着治疗后的水是可以饮用的？<br>[Nash]: Yeah after treated it is<br>纳什：是的，在治疗后，水可以饮用<br>[Mr. Keshe]: it drinkable<br>凯：可饮用的<br>[Nash]: Yeah after treated it can be its drinkable<br>纳什：是的，治疗后可以饮用<br>[Mr. Keshe]: so<br>凯：所以<br>[Kevin]: I have another question it’s not me to judge the testing procedure or the results or whatever but I have a question to the guideline value for drinking values for drinking water since the Ghana values fall obviously the usual WHO values I am not about the judge the conduct as you know from your own experience Mr. Keshe about the activity<br>凯文：凯史先生，我有另一个问题，不是由我来判定这个测试的过程或者结果或者其他什么，但是我对这个饮用水的指导线标准有疑问，加纳权威机构的指导标准明显紧跟世界卫生组织的数据后面，我不是在判断这个指导线，凯史先生，根据你个人的经验，这个活动<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No we are not got going that way<br>凯：不，我们不进行那个方向<br>[Kevin]:  No no no I have fundamental question about the value because I know the internal document with the tobacco industry when it comes to the values usually 80% of the people who make the parameter and the norms are from the tobacco industry so who are these people who make the values<br>凯文：不，不，不。关于这个指导线我有一个基本的问题，因为我知道烟草业的内部文件，当指定这个标准与评价的时候，80%指定相关标准的人来自于烟草业，是这些人在制定这些评价标准<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No you don’t question, I know you are a doctor in that way Kevin yeah I now you understand this but we don’t question the authorities we question our own technique and technology we are setting new standards<br>凯：不，我们不去质疑，我知道你是那个方向的医生，我知道你理解这个，但是我们不会去质问权威，我们只是质问自己的技术，我们正在设立新的标准<br>[Kevin]: But is drinking water<br>凯文：但是这个饮用水<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes this is only matters we are not hear to question WHO or anybody else we are here to look at the data we have and does the technology work for water treatment, this is what is important to us and what I see we have especially doctor Nash we have doctor Nana we have scientific baseline with Benjamin all highly qualified people within the national nuclear research institute of Ghana what we want to know putting those entries correctly and checking the data will you come back to us and look at the correct entry could be the secretary doing the thing because he was in a rush to be done and then what it looks to me everything seem to be in the right order and where unless we see a changes like this we can pick up because visualisation is there it’s a beautiful job what you have done there in Ghana I think you fantastically for what you have achieved but what can we do with these sediment what’s your opinion doctor Nash or doctor Nana can we use these sediments what we have collected because they haven’t disappeared you are testing the upper level water as I said you done you have a residue now you have these mineral in the this residue can we, yes carry on<br>凯：是的，饮用水是唯一重要的，我们在这里不是质问世界卫生组织或者其他任何人，我们在这里是看这个数据，看这个科技是否对水处理有功效，这对于我们来说才是重要的。我们现在有纳什博士，娜娜博士，还有本杰明，他们都是在加纳国家原子能研究机构从事研究的高资历的人，我们想要知道的是把这些条目设置正确，然后检查数据，你会再来和我们一起讨论，校对这个正确的条目应该是秘书做的，因为是在很匆忙中做的。这对我来说，一切都是在正确的秩序中， 除了一些地方需要改变，我们可以做到，因为可以看见的图像就在那里，你们在加纳做的很漂亮，我感谢你做的出色的工作，但是我们该如何处理这个沉积物呢，你的观点是什么，纳什博士，或者娜娜博士，我们能够使用我们所收集的这个沉积物吗，因为它们没有消失，就像我所说你们是在测试上层的水，你们有沉积物，现在你在沉积物里面有矿物质，我们能够，是的，继续<br>[Nash]: What we intend doing is we will analyse the sediment separately but we analyse for trace sediments and then heavy metal that is the classic one like lead mercury nickel then the essential one like iron manganese copper and zinc solely on the sediments then by next week when we meet again we will also have a look at the findings from analysing the sediments then we can know what it will be used for.<br>纳什：我们准备做的是我们会单独分析这个沉积物，但我们分析微量残留物，重金属的有铅，汞，镍，基本元素有铁，锰，铜，锌，单独的在沉积物上，下个星期我们再见面的时候，我们会看到来自分析残留物的数据报告，然后我们就能知道可以用来做什么<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask a question? There are ways to extract these mineral which are collected in the sediment to utilise for national what I call assets we can show you and the atomic energy authority how to separate like iron or copper or zinc or even gold if you can measure the gold content in these sediments at it can added to the national reserve because when you do it in the large scale you are not talking about grams we are talking about kilos and tons over a bigger operation so the system is pays for itself this is what we did for Fukushima with the Japanese government with techco we showed them how to convert the what I call the tritium into gold with in their tanks then what our purpose is not only cleaning but its making what is cleaned of not to become a problem for another thing we solve all the problems in one go so the way what I see maybe it’s a good process to be done until the atomic energy authority is once you cleaned up the sediments if you can separate the residue of the minerals which can all can used as quality merchant magnesium the same copper and zinc the same then we can recycle the CO2 or copper oxide back into the process we don’t need to keep on making it so these are the things which in our own run which we have to see which makes the system self-sufficient in what you clean you clear a lot of materials from the water of the rivers which becomes a national asset this is what I would like to see if you can look in that direction with the head of the authority in your country that then this gives the money of the institute to be able to develop their own technologies you don’t need to wait for the handouts from other governments if you can go in a little bit you spend a week or 2 on this and analyse all the materials we guide you I can give all mine time I can fly to Ghana stay with you a few weeks till we get this done but at the end you are a rich nation and atomic energy authority or the nuclear research institute will clear the rivers and make some income for the institute to have money to invest in the research and new scientist this is what the purpose is okay we go to clean water we can consume it, pardon.<br>凯：我能问一个问题吗？有办法从我们收集来的沉淀物中提取矿物从而用来作为国家的资产，我们能够向你展示，原子能机构如何分离铁或者铜或者锌，甚至金子，如果你能够在这些沉淀物中测量金子的话，这些都可以作为国家的储备，因为如果你大规模做的时候，就不是在谈论克，而是千克，吨的数量级，这是一个更大的操作过程，所以这个系统能够为自己买单，这就是我们为日本政府Techco公司福岛事件所做的，我们向他们展示如何在他们的水槽中将氚（超重氢）转换为金子，我们的目的不仅仅是清理，而且不让所清理出来的东西成为另外一个问题，我们一次性解决所有的问题，所以原子能机构所做的或许是一个很好的过程，一旦你清理出残留物，如果你能分离沉淀的矿物质，就能够很好的用于商业上，镁一样，铜和锌也一样，然后我们可以将CO2甘斯与氧化铜甘斯回收利用，我们不需要重新制作它们，所以这就是在我们的操作中使系统实现自给自足的方式，你从河水中清理了大量的矿物质，这些矿物质变成了国家的财产，这就是我所愿意看到的，如果你能将你们国家的权威领导者导入这个方向的话，这样就为机构提供了资金，从而能够发展自己的技术，你们就不需要其他国家的施舍，如果你能对它继续研究1周或者2周，分析所有的矿物元素，我们能够指导你，我能用全部时间支持你，我可以飞到加纳，与你呆上几个星期，直到把这件事情做好，最后你们会成为一个富裕的国家，原子能权威机构或者研究所会清理河流，可以为机构增加收入，从而将资金投入到研究与新科学家中，这就是我们的目的，我们清理了河流，我们也可以消费它，你说什么？<br>[Nash]: I am saying that’s a great idea<br>纳什：我说这是一个好主意<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes this is how I went with Techco I when Techco made a lot of money out of it they start draining gold they kick their guys our because they thought they are independent but in other words you have he then if these people are searching for gold and doing the dredging to do with the gold they must huge amounts of gold floating in this water if you can test for the water content if you can test for clarity and gold silver content  in your test for next week or the week after and then we go through the process of separation it very easy to separate most of these from the gans and you refeed back the gans into the system but the beauty of it is the water is clean enough i drink according to your opinions, am I correct?<br>凯：是的，这就是我和日本Techco公司所做的，我让Techco公司得到了大量的钱，他们开始提取黄金，裁员，因为他们认为可以做到独立了。换句话说，如果这些人在搜寻黄金，挖掘河床，水中就一定会漂浮着大量的金子，如果你能测试一些这个水里的东西，如果你能清楚的测试，你可以在下个星期或者下下星期检测到金子，银子等含量，然后我们可以进行分离的程序了，将这些物质元素与甘斯分离出来很容易，你可以将甘斯重新放回系统中，但是这其中的美妙之处在于水按照你们观点已经足够清澈，并且可以饮用了，对吗？<br>[Nash]: yes you are that correct<br>纳什：是的，很正确<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I would like to thank you for your collaboration and a we said we ae prepared to invest in Ghana and Keshe foundation in conjunction with space institute of Ghana as we are becoming part of them new organisation Keshe foundation investment is open to Africa in every shape or form and we have a trusted time with you and I will see a huge collaboration this is a fantastic presentation and I thank both you and doctor Nana and Benjamin and head of the nuclear research institute of Ghana the atomic energy of commission,<br>凯：我很感谢你的合作，就像我们说的，我们准备加大在加纳的投资，凯史基金会与加纳的太空机构合作，我们正在变成新组织的一部分，凯史基金会对非洲的投资是全方面开放的，我们对你是信赖的，我会看到一个巨大的合作，这是一次极好的展示，我很感谢你，娜娜博士，本杰明以及加纳原子研究机构和原子能委员会的领导。<br>[Benjamin]: Mr. Keshe we also want to show<br>本：凯史先生，我们还有要展示的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Pardon? Thank you very much<br>凯：什么？很感谢<br>[Benjamin]: We have some more to show and we need equipment also here because most of the tests you know takes a lot of time and Doctor Nash can tell you I give him a lot of hell. So we need a lot of equipment here to test some of the next stage of what I am going to show is the fish, the aquarium.<br>本：我们还有更多要展示的，我们这里也需要装备，大多数的测试花去了很多时间，纳什博士能够告诉你，我给了他大量的..所以我们这里需要大量的装备来进行下一步的测试，我将要展示的是鱼，养鱼缸<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Carry on Rick you are showing you got to let him share his screen you have to take the pdf down please you are controlling. Share your screen please for us.<br>凯：继续，瑞克，你让他展示他的屏幕，你需要下载PDF文件，你正在操作，好的，和我们分享屏幕<br>[Benjamin]: Can you see?<br>本：你能看见吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: you haven’t come up yet we are waiting since you are sharing your screen as you start sharing your screen you creating for you to come up.<br>凯：你还没有出现，我们可以一直等到你分享屏幕，你需要操作让你的屏幕出现<br>[Benjamin]: I have shared it so<br>本：我已经分享了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It says Benjamin Mensah has started sharing screen but we don’t see your beautiful face<br>凯：它说本杰明已经开始分享屏幕，但是我们还没有看见你漂亮的脸蛋<br>[somebody]: You can try to stop is and do it again,<br>某人：你可以试着关闭，然后再做一遍<br>[Mr. Keshe]: stop it and do it again<br>凯：停止，然后再做一遍<br>[Benjamin]: I am sharing again, is it through<br>本：我再分享，好了吗<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No it has not come in yet it says you want to share yes we see a picture of a man and a woman is somebody else sharing somewhere in the background<br>凯：没有。还没有出现，它说想要分享，好，我们看见了一个男人或女人的头像，是有人在后台在分享什么吗？<br>[Rick]: I don’t think so Mr. Keshe<br>瑞克：我不这样认为，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes that’s what we, yeah it comes up I think that’s why I say we need our own satellite system for our own connections. While Benjamin is online while Benjamin is trying to get sorted this out let me explain to you something which I very important we would like to thank the American organisation who has allowed us to place Benjamin within the structure of the Ghana space institute. This is part of the work we do with secret intelligence services and the others and the others and through their support and specially people we do not mention in the from within the structure of the communication of the American government and the industry who have supported us to being the position of Benjamin into Ghana we collaborate again with them they are part of the Keshe foundation international organisation and we thank them they know who they are not to disclose their names for the facilitating for Benjamin to return as part of the Keshe foundation into Ghana. We thank the organisation like within the structure of CIA and the rest who we collaborate with very close we know who they are and they facilitate this.<br>凯：嗯，这就是我说的我们需要自己的用作通讯的卫星系统。在本杰明在弄好这个连接的时候，让我向你们解释一下很重要的事情，我很感谢美国的组织允许我们将本杰明安置在加纳太空机构的结构里面，这是我们与秘密情报服务以及其他人合作的一部分，通过他们的支持，尤其那些人，我们不会公开提及他们的名字，他们在美国政府的联络部门和工业部门里面，他们提供支持使得我们将本杰明设置在加纳现在的位置上，我们又再一次的合作，他们是凯史基金会国际组织的一部分，我们感谢他们，他们知道他们是谁，我们不会公开名字，作为凯史基金会工作的一部分，他们为本杰明返回到加纳提供便利。我们感谢这些组织，比如CIA结构里的人，我们很紧密的合作，我们知道他们是谁，他们为此提供了帮助<br>[Benjamin]: can you see? Can you see our screen?<br>本：你能看见吗？能看见我们的屏幕吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So this is a by having Benjamin there it’s a collaboration of governments and people in within being in the government or our part of ti and we have used the governmental connection to facilitate this and I thank our American support for this move. Go ahead Benjamin we see both fishes<br>凯：是的。 ，所以把本杰明安排在加纳是与政府以及在政府里的人的一次合作，他们是我们的一部分，我们使用政府的关系来促成这件事情，我很感谢我们美国朋友对这次行动的支持，继续，我们看见了鱼。（02：05：40）<br>[Benjamin]: okay so we have 2 tanks here the green tank and then the, the green tank and then the yellow tank actually what I am doing here is to go a lot tests on the water and also the what we get from the aquarium so I have taken already samples to doctor Nash’s lab to do some test on the water. If you can see, as you can see clearly there are differences in the Turbidity one is more clearer and then the other which is not treated is a little bit darker that is the green tank.<br>本：好，我们有两个水箱，绿色的水箱与黄色的水箱，我在做的是，我要对水做大量的测试，以及从水箱里面得到什么，我也从娜娜博士的实验室得到了样本来对水做一些测试，你们能够看见在浊度上有不同，一个是更加清澈，一个没有被治疗，有些暗淡，就是这个绿色的水箱<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What have you put in them?<br>凯：你在里面放了什么？<br>[Benjamin]: We have 2 fishes in each tank and we had other small one also so what we have in here is I have a feeding stitch and I have a submersible pump and I have an air reactor that mean they can what do you call it takes air from outside and then convert it the oxygen and carbon dioxide so that the fish can live on them okay, and I have in the tank also a natural and artificial weed. The natural weed is also to do the same thing that the pumps are doing in case the tower is sticking off that is the fail in safe mechanism I put in the tanks that is if the power goes off for a long time like 2 days or 3 days the fish can still you know use the natural system to you know take in air and then prepare food for themselves so what we see here they come can’t come a little bit further can you. Okay if you can see from the filtering chamber that the water which is not treated with the gans is more dirty and I have taken a sample to doctor Nash’s lab and it’s the same thing the water is more dirtier with the untreated tank but the one that is treated or fed with the CO2 has less pollution or has less sediment collection so what we are doing is we are also I have doctor Nash some parameters to take like the pH level the ammonium level the nitrate and the nitrite copper, chlorine and general hardness and carbonate levels and phosphate dissolved oxygen, salinity and then  calcium. Because we don’t have so much equipment here some of the test like, I need an electronic scale here and I have told a guy who brought the fishes to me bring me a pH meter and he has seen this office but I am still waiting for him to bring it there are some test I can do them myself at home and to measure also the fish size we need a kind of laser to actually measure the length of the fish and then the width that is what we going to use the electronic scales to measure so in effect what I am going to do is to fetch the fish in container, first of all I will fetch some water in the tank and then 0 it with the water on the scale I will put it to 0 that I will make it weightless and then put the fish into the water and then measure the weight the weight of the fish.<br>本：每个水箱里都有2条鱼，另一条比较小，这个水箱有用于传输的缝纫针 ，还有一个潜水泵，还有一个空气反应器 ，这个摄像机能不能远一点，你能够看到<br>，它的作用是将外面的空气转变为里面的氧气与二氧化碳，所以鱼就能够继续生活，在水箱里，我们也有人工的与天然的水草，这个天然的水草是与水泵起到同样的作用，是以防电力中断的一个安全机制，就是如果电力中断比如2到3天，那么鱼也能够用这个天然的系统吸取空气，为自己制造食物， 你能看到这个滤盒，这个水是没有经过甘斯处理的，变得更脏了，我也取了样本拿到娜娜博士的实验室，也是一样的，水更脏了，是在这个没有处理过的水箱里，<br>而这个经过CO2甘斯处理的水就少了一些污染 ，有更少的残余沉积物，我们做的是，我们也准备做物理参数的测试，包括PH值，铵含量，硝酸盐与亚硝酸，铜含量，氯含量，总硬度，含碳量，磷酸盐含量，溶解氧含量，钙含量。由于我们没有很多的设备，一些测试，我需要一个电子秤，我告诉给我带来鱼的人，让他带来一个PH计，我还在等待他的到来，有一些测试我在家里就能够做到，我们要测量鱼的大小，用一种激光束，测量鱼的长度与宽度，这就是我们要用电子秤测量，我要做的是从容器里取出鱼，首先是取出水，在秤上归零，就会出现失去的重量，然后把鱼放回水箱里，这样就计算出鱼的重量。，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can I ask you a question what are you feeding, what have you used for the clear thank?<br>凯：我能问个问题，你是用什么在供养，你用什么供养你的清澈的水箱？<br>[Benjamin]: The clear I have used the clear part I am using CO2 in combination with the food of the fish but the other one<br>本：这个清澈的水箱，我是用的CO2甘斯与鱼的食物相混合，但另外一个<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Please do not use copper oxide as a mixture<br>凯：请不要使用氧化铜甘斯作为混合物<br>[Benjamin]: No no copper oxide CO2 because copper oxide will finish them in no time, okay so I am using this, I am using this also to feed them but the one which is not treated with the CO2 gans does not I give them less of this food, more sorry of the food and then when they are fed get just a little of a fraction just a fraction of this feed but when you look at the sizes they are growing bigger and more aggressive or more happier than and they can sink deeper than the one that are not, the water the not treated<br>本：不，不，不用氧化铜甘斯，是co2甘斯，因为氧化铜甘斯不知什么时候会结束它们的生命，好，我是用的这个来供养它们 ，但那个绿色的水箱没有用co2甘斯进行处理，我也比较少的这个食物，不是，抱歉，是更多的这样的食物，但这边这一个用的比较少的这样的饲料，但是你看这边鱼的大小，显得更大，更具主动性与活力，更快乐，也能够下沉的更低，与这边没有经过处理过的水箱相比，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what are you saying you are feeding the treated one more or less?<br>凯：你是为这个处理过的水箱供养的食物更少还是更多？<br>[Benjamin]: The treated one I feed them less<br>本：这个处理过的水箱，我给它们供养的食物更少<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay<br>凯：好<br>[Benjamin]: But the ones that are not treated I feed them more but still in terms of aggression of aggression and size the treated ones are growing bigger as the people I constructed gilbert is here gilbert has seen them from the day we started and they are growing well so that is it. We have some more time to see how defer and also we have mushroom here also to show there are some mushroom experiment that.<br>本：但这边没有经过处理的水箱我给它们供养更多的食物，但还是，就进攻性活力以及大小方面，经过甘斯治疗过的鱼长的更大，人们看见了我构建的这个过程，吉尔伯特在这里，从我开始构建这个实验的开始，他见证了这一过程，它们现在长的很好，就是这样。我们更多的时间看它们是如何被供养的。在这里我们也有蘑菇可以展示，我们做了蘑菇的实验<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you show us this famous mushroom I have seen pictures but I don’t know what it means. You keep on sending me reports and pictures but I don’t know what is the mushroom tell us about the mushroom please<br>凯：你能够向我们展示这个有名的蘑菇吗，我们看过图片，但是我不知道那意味着什么，你不停的给我发报告和图片，但是我不知道蘑菇是什么，请告诉我们关于蘑菇的事情（02：12：44）<br>[Benjamin]: Okay can you see?<br>本：好的，看见了吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: He says why do you feed them less?<br>凯：有人问为什么你给那个水箱供养的少些？<br>[Benjamin]: Why do I feed them less because we feed them with CO2 and CO2 even should be enough for them to live on because?<br>本：为什么我供养它们少一些，因为我们用CO2来供养它们，靠CO2就足够让它们生存<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think if you feed them equal then you see the effect of CO2 because now you are interfering with the food, I think you better feed them exactly the same to be correct and then you see what the CO2 add to it.<br>凯：我认为如果你平等的喂养它们，然后你就能看见CO2甘斯的功效，因为你供养不平衡，食物就成为一个影响测试的干扰因素，我认为你最好平等的喂养它们，然后就能看到加上CO2后的效果<br>[Benjamin]: Okay<br>本：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Is that Doctor Nana’s hand showing everything. Hello Doctor Nana. It’s nice to meet you again we met in Rome during the ambassadorial meeting thank you very much for your help and cooperation Doctor Nana<br>凯：一直在移动的是娜娜博士的手吗？很高兴见到你，我们在罗马大使会议上见过面，很感谢你的帮助与合作，娜娜博士<br>[Benjamin]: Okay so I have here 2 boxes but in each we have the mushroom composite bag this is a composite<br>本：好，我们有2个盒子，每一个都有蘑菇，这个是复合成的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Go again lower<br>凯：低一点<br>[Benjamin]: This is the composite bag and in the composite bag and the how the mushroom it’s made up of some saw dust and wheat brown and I bought I think how many weeks ago, 2 weeks ago and we started treating what do you call it the mushroom with the gans the first ones that I received are this ones, can you see?<br>本：这个是复合成的一包 ，在这个蘑菇里面是有粉末屑与小麦棕色，我是在2个星期前买的，我们开始用CO2甘斯进行处理，我们第一次接受的是这个蘑菇 ，你能看见吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah<br>凯：是的<br>[Benjamin]: so I actually washed the mushroom treated the CO2 I actually took all the salinity from the gans out and then water the composite the composite back the first 2 with the CO2 and then in no time about 2 or 3 days the mushroom started sprouting so that tell you the power of it but the gans and then the other one I left the one that are coming up now it have taken slow time to show up and its now coming up.<br>本：所以实际上我用甘斯洗了蘑菇，我把甘斯的盐分都洗走了，然后用水稀释这个复合物，用CO2处理最先的2个蘑菇，大约2到3天，蘑菇开始发芽，这样就显示出了甘斯的力量，而我留在另一边的蘑菇就花费了更多的时间才长出来。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: How long is the test done that one is just showing and the other one has grown so much.<br>凯：测试用了多长时间，这个蘑菇很快长出，另一个生长的很慢<br>[Benjamin]: 2 weeks but what I will do is I went to the same I planted them the same time so. What I am going to do is I am going to take samples of this mushroom to Doctor’s Nash lab then we see what is in the one that is watered with the gans and then the one that is not watered with the gans and then we see weather nutritionally we have improved upon that or not and then this on that we can do further more experiment with the growth and.<br>本：2个星期，但我要去做的是，这是一样的，这些蘑菇我设置的是一样的；我要做的是将一些样本蘑菇送到纳什博士的实验室，一个是用甘斯水喂养的，一个没有用甘斯水喂养，然后我们再来看什么因素更具营养，就能在这个基础上进行改进，以及做更多促进生长的实验<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay so the one which is grown over the box is grown at the same time but just put CO2 in the water.<br>凯：好，那个长到盒子外面的蘑菇，是你将CO2甘斯放在水里喂养它的时候长出来的<br>[Benjamin]: In the water then the watering what do you call port so that<br>本：在水里，将水导入<br>[Mr. Keshe]: There is a question on the panel asking how did you put the CO2 with the fish tank did you add it or is it there just as field?<br>凯：在聊天面板上有人问你如何将co2甘斯喂养鱼缸，你是放在里面还是作为一个场域？<br>[Benjamin]: so I have the gans, okay I have the gans in my hand as you can see and then a string so what I do is I draw I mil of the gans and then drop it in the tank<br>本：我手里面有甘斯 ，你可以看到，这个管子，然后我抽取一毫寸甘斯，丢到水箱里。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think you can just put the container in the centre without doing anything and the fish will get the same  you don’t need to add the gans into the water because you’re dealing you still work on the matter thinking you are adding it because you thinks it going to take, gans works on the plasma condition so what I think you better do put that CO2 container just in the water the field of the plasma of the gans will go out and I think it will have the same effect as you putting in there this way you can feed the fish for 100s of years that way you are going to run out then you have to make more.<br>凯：我认为你可以将co2甘斯容器放在中心，而不用做任何事情，对于鱼的效果也会是一样的；你不需要将甘斯放到水中，因为你仍在用物质的思维方式思考问题，因为你认为将甘斯放在里面，鱼会食用甘斯的能量，甘斯是在等离子体的环境下运作的，我认为你可以CO2甘斯容器放在水里，甘斯的等离子体场会发散出去，我认为这会与你将甘斯放在里面的效果是一样的，通过这种方式你可以供养鱼100年，而你用的那种方式很快就会消耗光，你不得不制作更多的CO2甘斯<br>[Benjamin]: That is true it was full and I have been filling it all the time<br>本：确实是这样，它是饱的，我一直在添加<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Just put the container you don’t need this, what you got to realise even the process of the cleaning of the water try to put the CO2 in the container and let water inside the water that you don’t need get the unit you don’t need to add the gans into the water and see if you get the same result I am sure you get the same result of cleaning and everything else because we have to change the mind-set of the matter to interact than interacting the fields so if you put your CO2 bottle in there you can leave the fishes they go through it and you see they start eating from it. The nibble at is and the water continues to get fed because this way you have to keep on adding and adding and that way they just take the field most probably the they stop eating you got to observer how much of the food you give is going to stay at the bottom because when the fish is not hungry it won’t eat and if you clean up the bottom that there is no residue then you can compare that the food is still stays at the bottom or will it rot or will stay there as fresh because the CO2 will do the job for it to clean it so I think you better stop feeding them just put a container in. and see if it doesn’t change or put another tank and try this and carry on feeding because now you get the CO2 in the process of the animal with that way you get the energy but not the CO2 as part of its digestion system and this is where the difference should come.<br>凯：就放上容器，你不需要那样，你需要意识到，即使清理水的过程也是这样，将CO2甘斯放在容器里，让水保持原样，你不需要将甘斯添加到水里，然后看你是否得到相同的结果，我肯定你会在净化以及其他方面得到相同的结果，因为我们必须要改变物质相互作用的思维定势，转变为场与场相互作用的思维方式，所以如果你把co2瓶子放在那里， 你会看见鱼经过时会吃它，鱼啃咬这个瓶子，水持续的得到供能，因为你这种方式就得不断的添加再添加；而用那种方式它们只是从场中得到能量，很有可能它们会停止进食，你要观察你给的有多少食物还留在水箱底部，因为当鱼不饿的时候，它就不会吃了，如果你清理箱底，就没有残留物，然后你可以观察食物是否还留在箱底，或者食物是否会腐烂，是否还保持着新鲜，因为co2甘斯会做清理的工作，所以我认为你最好不要用甘斯给它们喂食，就把一个容器瓶放在里面即可。看是否有任何改变，或者用另一个水箱试验这个方法，可以继续用食物喂养，因为你现在将CO2甘斯导入动物的环境中，它会得到能量而不是CO2甘斯作为消化系统的一部分，这就是应该会出现的差别。<br>[Benjamin]: Even was thinking that the other time because I have bought some copper pate I want do the what do you call it put the plates inside and zinc inside and see for it to start producing.<br>本：我在考虑在什么时候，因为我买了一些铜板，我想要做，将一块铜板放在里面，另一边放上锌片，看是否会产生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do not put any copper in any of them you will kill the fish.<br>凯：不要将任何铜放在它们之中，因为这样你会杀死鱼<br>[Benjamin]: Nano coated copper.<br>本：纳米铜<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Nothing you cannot introduce copper especially in the white meat. If you introduce the cooper into this environment I am sure because I have it from experience you animal will die very quickly because the energy is too much they cannot absorb it the growth of the body in the white fish is different than the red fish and the red meat and the you can calls a growth and the expansion is now what is looking for you can’t free it go. Do not use never especially with water animals and her can do it maybe with tuna only but all the small fishes with the white, what we call the water fish do not feed please any CO2 we have seen them the energy impact is too much and the animal dies.<br>凯：任何相关的都不要放进去，你不要将铜放入这个白肉的环境中，如果你将这个铜引入到这个环境中，我很肯定我有这个经验，你的动物会死的很快，因为能量太多了，它们无法吸收，白鱼的身体生长是与红鱼和红血肉不同的，你可以称之为生长，能量出现扩张，而你不能让它得到摆脱。绝不要用在水生动物身上，也许金枪鱼是唯一可以的，但所有的小白鱼，也就是水生鱼，不要用CO2喂养，我们看见过，能量的影响太大，动物都死了。<br>[Benjamin]: Mr. Keshe is there the need the conference room for another.<br>本：好，凯史先生，似乎需要另一个会议室可以用来<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask you a simple quick question it the Doctor with the stroke arm with you or has he left?<br>凯：我能问你一个简单快速的问题吗，那个手臂中风的博士是与你在一起吗，还是他离开了？<br>[Benjamin]: He is here<br>本：他在这里<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can we see his arm is he driving<br>凯：我们能看他的手臂吗，他还在开车吗？<br>[Benjamin]: No he told me he is not driving no that’s what I said I will confirm本：没有，他告诉我他没有再开车了，那就是我说的，我确认了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: but he is there difference in his hand can you tell us what he is seen.<br>凯：但是他在那里，手臂有些不一样，你能告诉我他看见了什么吗？<br>[Benjamin]:He doesn’t want.<br>本：他不想要….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Let him speak it doesn’t matter do you see any. Good morning Doctor<br>凯：让他讲话，没关系，你看见什么了吗？早上好，博士<br>[Doctor]: Hi good morning<br>博士：你好，早上好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do you see any changes in what you are doing in regarding your stroke with your arm please because I know you doing something in the background<br>凯：在你所处理的中风的手臂上，你看见了什么变化吗？因为我知道你做了什么<br>[Doctor]: A little bit<br>博士：有一点<br>[Mr. Keshe]: How much, can you put the microphone a bit higher please?<br>凯：多大程度，你能够把你的麦克风拿高一点吗？<br>[Doctor]; well I think maybe, this is, I can’t tell that it helped me<br>博士：我认为，或许，这个。我不能说，但确实有效果<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay we keep an eye on you to see how far we can go and I will try to explain to Benjamin how to help you directly because you can reverse most of it. Thank you very much Doctor thank you for your time. Okay I know you got to hand over the room I would like to thank Doctor Nash and Pardon<br>凯：好，我们密切关注你，看我们能够走多远，我会告诉本杰明如何直接帮助你，因为你可以在很大程度上逆转你的病情，很感谢你，博士。谢谢你抽出时间。好，我知道你要交出这个房间了，我很感谢你们，纳什博士，什么？<br>[Benjamin]: Doctor Nana wants to say something finally<br>本：娜娜博士最后想要说些什么<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes Doctor Nana<br>凯：好的，娜娜博士<br>[Nana]: Mr. Keshe I want to say thank you very much for the opportunity and we still on the paper documentation to formalize the whole process but in the mean time I will say we keep on with communication and we will keep on with our initial testing so.<br>娜娜：凯史先生，我想要说很感谢这个机会，我们还在进行相关的文件手续工作以使整个过程正式化，但同时我们会持续保持联络沟通，我们会继续进行最初的测试<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much Doctor Nana you are, I put it this way if united nation listen to you we have to you are an influential person internationally and we respect you working with us.<br>凯：很感谢你，娜娜博士，这么说吧，如果联合国听你的演讲，我们就不得不做，你是一个具有国际影响力的人物，我们很敬重你与我们一起工作<br>[Nana]: thank you very much<br>娜娜：很感谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thank you very much indeed. We say goodbye to you Benjamin and thank you very much for your work you have aged in 4 months a lot it’s a lot of work you are doing there.<br>凯：真的很感谢。我们要告别本杰明了，很感谢你所做的工作，你已经在那里持续工作了4个月，所以你做了很多工作<br>[Benjamin]: and we are we have something on farming we are going to show later so later I will send you the information and<br>本：我们在种植方面也有一些东西要展示，我们会稍后展示，我会发给你一些信息<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Join us next Thursday again in the future and organise it that you can show us the result and the papers<br>凯：在下个星期二加入到我们，如果你组织好，你可以向我们展示所取得的结果以及文件<br>[Benjamin]: Okay thank you<br>本：好的，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much thank you indeed. Thank you Benjamin. Can you see the process is very simple you can, can you stop sharing that we can take over please thank you very much Benjamin. As I said it was fantastic to see this, this is a work of nearly 4 or 5 months of working establishing setting up gaining the trust of the authorities to be able to do these king of works we will see more of these cooperation we saw on last on Tuesday with respect to universities with the hospitals Keshe foundation worldwide is finding avenues by invitation of most of the government or whatever to start working because they see the result and I am sure when we release the CE certificate the medical certification to of the pens and the pads by tomorrow the first pads internationally made by in Italy and the pens will dispatch on Monday morning then we will see the change in the course of us we seen literally on what people starting and using and doing it themselves where do we go now you are in charge Rick where are you taking us. I think that was a fantastic presentation<br>凯：很感谢，真的很感谢。谢谢你，本杰明。你们能看见这个过程是很简单的，你能关闭分享吗，这样我们就可以将屏幕接过来。很感谢你，本杰明。就像我说的，这是一个极好的过程，这个工作目前用了4到5个月，从政府那里建立、设置以及赢得信任，进而能够展开这样的工作，我们会看到更多这样的合作，我们看见在上个星期二与大学，与医院进行这样的合作，全世界的凯史基金会正在寻求各种途径与大多数政府展开合作，因为他们看到了结果，我很确定，当我明天释放关于医疗笔与减痛包的欧盟医疗认证，减痛包是在意大利生产，笔会在星期一早上发送出去，我们会看见进程的改变，我们会逐渐的看到人们开始自己制造，使用这些装置。我们现在进行到哪里了，你还是在负责，瑞克。你要把我们带到哪里？我认为那是一个极好，极美妙的展示。<br>[Rick]: Yes very interesting<br>瑞克：是的，很有意思。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We saw agriculture and decontamination and the<br>凯：我们看见农业与净化，还有…<br>[Rick]: we have got there is a<br>瑞克：我们这里有…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can we go to Kenya’s direction even its do we have it ready ro<br>凯：我们能够进入到肯尼亚方面的展示吗？我们已经准备好了？<br>[Rick]: I have got the power point presentation.<br>瑞克：我有幻灯片的展示<br>[Mr. Keshe]: they can present it if there are available, because he has to explain is he still awake or is it too late<br>凯：如果可以用了，就能够展示出来。因为他要解释的，他在吗，还是时间比较晚了<br>[Rick]: There he is I will promote him to panellist<br>瑞克：他在那里，我把他拉到面板上来<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay thank you very much. Okay let me explain would you like to introduce yourself share the screen please before you share the screen make sure what you going to show us at PowerPoint is on your screen that we don’t see the programs in the back ground so that we<br>凯：好的，很感谢。让我解释一下，在分享屏幕前，请先进行自我介绍，请保证你想要展示的幻灯片在屏幕上，我们看不到背景的项目。<br> [Rick]: Let me now we find you sure<br>瑞：让我来，现在找到你了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: He is there we can see him, goodmorning you have to unmute yourself<br>凯：他在那里，我们能看见他，早上好，你必须给自己静音<br>[Gatwa]:  unmute<br>噶图瓦：静音，好，稍等<br>[Rick]: There we go ,<br>瑞克：好了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: good morning Doctor Gutamanga thank you very much for your staying with us and I know it’s very late time you are in united states could you please introduce yourself first who you are your background and then what you doing what you are going to show us please<br>凯：早上好，噶图瓦，很感谢你与我们在一起，我知道现在你在美国的时间已经很晚了，请先介绍一下自己，你是谁，你的背景，还有你正在做什么，以及要向我们展示什么。<br>[Gatwa]: my name is Gatwa Mugwa I am from Kenya I am in the united states now where I have been since 1992 after studying in Kenya I worked briefly for Kenya government at the at the purave centre in Kenya and then retuned to school in Kenya fir 2 year where I studied biology agriculture food is an organic agriculture for 2 years and then I went to California where I studied animal ecology I was in college for 6 months and then I decide I waited more than just a certificate and I applied and I was accepted into the university of California school where I did 2 masters degrees and a BA in environmental studies and politics and then I went to Colorado where I did 2 masters degrees first master of professional studies and international agriculture and rural development and then a master of science in crop and science and then I was later admitted to university of Wyoming where did my PhD in agronomy. I have been teaching for that university on part time basis until last year spring and now I am here as a student of the space ship institute I am going to show a presentation PowerPoint presentation about a brief experiment I did in Kenya and other country of experiment planning with gans. Can I start now?<br>噶图瓦：我的名字是噶图瓦-木古瓦，我来自肯尼亚，现在是在美国，自从1992年我就在这里，在肯尼亚学习完后，我为肯尼亚政府在一个普雷夫中心工作了一小段时间,然后回到肯尼亚的学校学习了2年，学习的是生物农业，也就是有机农业。然后我来到加利福尼亚，在那里我学了动物生态学，我在大学学习了6个月，我决定要继续学习拿到文凭，我递交了申请，我被接受进入到加利福利亚大学，在那里我修了双学位—环境学研究与政治学研究，然后我去克雷尔学习双学位，专业硕士学习—国际农业与农村发展，然后是种植专业方面的科学硕士，然后我被怀俄明大学所接受，在那里我读了农学博士学位。我部分时间在那所大学教书，直到去年春天，现在我是太空学院的一名学员，我将要用幻灯片的形式对一个我在肯尼亚以及其他国家用甘斯做的实验进行简短的展示，现在我可以开始吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes please let me explain why you are showing this they explained to us he is knowledge seeker in the space institute started in January of this year and in part of the teaching he showed us the presentation and as its agriculture today I invited him to come and show us and on the back of this Doctor Mugwa is going back to Kenya sponsored and paid by the Keshe foundation to start the Keshe foundation and the agriculture and the whole process in Nairobi and I thank you for joining us and I hope we learn a lot from you with your experience and back ground. Please go ahead<br>凯：是的，请让我解释一下，你为什么会展示这个实验，噶图瓦博士已经向我们解释过他从今年1月开始是太空学院的一名学生，今天教学的一部分，他会向我们展示农业部分，我邀请他过来向我们展示，噶图瓦博士会在凯史基金会的资助下回到肯尼亚从事凯史基金会以及农业方面的工作，在肯尼亚首都内罗毕，我很感谢你能够加入到我们中，我希望能从你的经验以及知识背景中学习到更多的知识<br>[Gatwa]: a study was done in Kenya to assess the impact of CO2 gans water on clothes and yields of potatoes in Kenya this experiment was done between November 5 and February this year and what you see here is the small props that are used for the potatoes and these was just about.<br>噶：在肯尼亚完成了一个实验，是评估CO2甘斯水对土豆的外观以及产量的影响。这个实验是在去年11月5号到今年2月之间完成的，你可以看到这里有一个小道具是为土豆使用，这些是关于<br>[Rick]: We have to have the screen share in order to see the picture on your<br>瑞克：我们必须分享屏幕才能看到你展示的图片<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Switch of first, bring the page up and then switch back on sharing they stop sharing that nobody can see your system that find them okay<br>凯：首先转换一下，将页面放上去，然后转变到分享上，停止分享别人就看不到你的系统<br>[Gatwa]: Okay is that fine<br>噶：好了吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay it’s perfect now can you?<br>凯：很好<br>[Rick]: Great thank you<br>瑞克：很不错，谢谢<br>[Gatwa]: okay. Alright there it is, so this experiment is an impact of CO2 gans water of growth and yield of potato water can you see that presentation now?<br>噶：好，发生了什么。就是它了。所以这个实验是关于CO2甘斯对土豆的产量以及生长的影响，你们能够看见展示的吗？<br>[Rick]: yes, yes it’s perfect<br>瑞克：是的，是的，很好<br>[Gatwa]: okay thank you and here I am this is the plot that I used its 20ft by 15ft and this plot was divided into 2 plots subplots plot A and plot B and potatoes were planted in both plants the potatoes where of the same variety but what was different was the treatment in one A plot it received water treatment and in B plot I used CO2 water gans water and gans here is gases in nano state. Potatoes in both plot A and plot B were soaked for 5 hours before planting and that was the treatment. Soaking in water for A and soaking in CO2 gans water in plot B. This is how I collected the gans. The right here this is how I collected the CO2 gans using simple method mesh wire because I couldn’t find the zinc plate we used the mesh wire chicken wire which was galvanised and a nano coated copper coil that I made and on the left I used simple mill and then nano coated copper coil for collecting CH3 gans and these are some of the gans that I collected in the begging of the experiment but I collect more later and for the purposes of these experiments only the CO2 gans were used and this is how I soaked in plastic container to the left and this is rain water by the way in both cases and to that I add is CO2 gans water what was noticed here immediately was that the water to the eft which is dirty which the potatoes have soil in them but immediately when it CO2 gans water the soil sank to the bottom thus showing the at the caci of CO2 gans and for purification of water that was a bonus for this experiment as it was not testing the water purification.<br>噶：好的，谢谢。这是一个基址图，我用的长20英尺，宽15英尺，这个基址图分为基图A与基图B ，在两边都种植了土豆，而且是一样的品种， ，不同的是基图A接受的是一般水的处理，基图B接受的是甘斯水的处理，甘斯在这里是指气体的纳米状态。 ，A与B里的土豆在种植前都被浸泡了5个小时，这就是处理，A中的土豆是用水浸泡，B中的土豆是用甘斯水浸泡。这就是我如何收集甘斯的 ，在右边就是我如何收集CO2甘斯的，用的是简单的金属网格，因为我找不到锌片，我用的是这个金属网格，铁丝网，这些金属网是经过镀锌处理的，还有一个纳米铜线圈；在左边，我用的是简单的铁钉，还有纳米铜线圈，制作CH3甘斯。这些是我在实验开始收集的甘斯 ，之后可以收集的更多。基于实验的目的，只有CO2甘斯能够被使用。这幅图展示的是我如何在塑料容器里浸泡的 ，左边用的是水，实际上开始都用的是水，然后在右边的容器加入甘斯水，我立刻注意到左边容器比较脏，有一些污泥在种子上面，当我将CO2甘斯放入右边容器，污泥沉到瓶底了，显示出CO2甘斯净化水的功能，这是这个实验的额外收获，因为这个实验不是要测试甘斯的净化能力。<br>So I don’t know whether you can see the potatoes because I can’t but this is 3 weeks after planting there was no difference noticed between plot A and plot B but here this if flowering stage and at flowering stage what was noticed here was that although its not obvious in this picture but the potatoes on the right that is to say the potatoes treated with gans water flowered had flowers before those treated with water and that was substantial the difference so this is at maturity stage the difference in growth was now so obvious because those treated with CO2 gans water matured early and you can see that when potatoes mature they whither and to the right they withered and almost dried before the those treated with water which are still green and at this stage when that’s when you will have a step and both plot were harvested individually the potatoes collected counted and then weighed what was noticed most of the plants was the about 3 or 4 tubers big ones and then a lot of small ones several small one and for the purposes of these experiments those that big tubers and the small ones were harvested and counted and then weighed. Results treatment A that is potatoes that were treated with water 217 were harvested from that plot with a total weight of 7Kg weight for a potato when you divide the 7Kg divided by the potatoes 217 you got about 32grams 0.03225Kg that is just 32 grams in plot treated with CO2 gans water 147 potatoes were harvested with a total weight of 4.75 Kg when you maths dividing the total weight by the number of potatoes you got the weight of potatoes as the same as in plot A that is to say about 32grams.<br>噶：所以我不知道你们是否能看到这些土豆，因为我看不见，这个图片是种植3个星期后的情况 ，我注意到在基图A与基图B没有什么区别。这个是开花的阶段，<br>我们注意到在开花的阶段，尽管在这个图片上面不是很明显，但是右边的经过甘斯水处理过的土豆比经过水处理的土豆先行开花了，这是一个实质性的区别。这是成熟的阶段 ，在成熟阶段，土豆在生长方面的区别就显得很明显，经过甘斯水处理过的土豆成熟的比较早，你可以看到土豆成熟了就枯萎了，比起左边经过水处理的还是绿色一片的土豆来说，右边的土豆枯萎和干缩了；然后是收获的阶段 ，两边的土豆各自收集起来，计数，称重，我注意到大多数植物有3到4个大的块茎 ，其他的是小的块茎，基于实验的目的，这些块茎也都要被收割，计数以及称重。结果是<br>，经过水处理的A区收割217个土豆，总重量7KG，平均每个土豆重量是0.03225KG，即32毫克；经过甘斯水处理的B区收割土豆147个，总重量4.75KG，平均每个土豆重量是0.03231KG，与A区的土豆均重一样，即每个土豆重32毫克。<br>That was difficult that this is not sure that even the potatoes that matured earlier by 2 weeks but have matured enough to be of the same weight but potatoes treated with gans water in plot B matured approximately 2 weeks earlier than those treated with water in plot A , there was no weight difference per potato in both plot this is a good result as far as I’m concerned because it shows us that maturity of plot B was faster that means you could grow a crop in Kenya between season like a short season between the main season and grow potatoes and harvest them in good time to plant the next crop also this can be very important in term agriculture elsewhere in regions that have very short season growing season or cropping seasons especially in the great plains some of the places in the great plains have very short cropping season because winter is gone and all the rain sometimes to June and to summarize gans water make it cause early potato maturing in plot B and potatoes in Kenya vote Yes for CO2 gans and I agree with them. Thank you very much<br>噶 ：这不是确定的，即使土豆早成熟2个星期，但是能够足够成熟到成为一样的重量，结论是在B区用甘斯水进行处理的土豆比A区经过水处理的土豆要早成熟将近2个星期，两边土豆的均重没有什么区别，就我而言这是一个很好的结果，这显示出一种快速，B区的土豆成熟的快，这就意味着你能够在肯尼亚季节交替之际进行种植，比如在两个主要季节之间的短季里，在好的时节里种族与收获它们，然后种植下一个作物；这对于世界上具有农业种植的短季节性质的其他地区来说很重要，尤其是那些大平原地区，那里有很短的种植节气，因为冬天走了，所有的雨水集中在6月，总的来说，甘斯水能够使B区的土豆早熟 ，所以在肯尼亚用CO2甘斯种植土豆，我表示赞同！谢谢！ ，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much Doctor. Can you as an economist if you look at this, we got the picture of the potatoes next to each other we see on the right even the though you have a smaller numbers you have more of the size which is usable than the small ones on the left. Agriculture especially like we see this is a trial we can do it in a larger scale hopefully when you go back to Kenya in countries like US in Texas where there is the water and the ground water is literally depleting and farmers are reducing production because of production and the water tables this can make a huge difference when you got hundreds of hectares and you got thousands of hectares on the cultivation. What is important I think what we heard with Benjamin too, we got to test this and see if we have organically changed or is it still the same? One thing we have to see is are these potatoes genetically modified before you plant them are they local potatoes.<br>凯：很感谢你，博士。你能够作为一个经济学家看一下，我们有这样的两张土豆的图片，我们看见右边的图片，尽管你有一些小的土豆，但是你有比左边更大的可用的土豆。对于农业来说，我们看见这只是一个试验，当你回到肯尼亚，我们有希望在更大规模上做，比如在美国的德克萨斯州，地下水实际上正在耗尽，农民的产量在减少，因为水的缺乏以及地下水位在降低，这就会造成巨大的不同，如果你有上百公顷，或者上千公顷的种植土地，我认为重要的是，我们也从本杰明那里听过，我们测试一下看是否农作物发生了有机的改变，或者还是一样的？有一件事情是我们要看看这些土豆是经过基因改造（转基因）了吗，或者还是本地的土豆？<br>[Gatwa]: This was local potatoes<br>噶：这是本地的土豆。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What we have seen with the systems which lets say the seeds have been genetically modified when you use the CO2 water gans or the gans directly to stock the material in, you will find out that the genetically modified structure by organisations who try to control the seeds because he seed is not in the DNA it’s on the surface of it is new and is not part of the structure it loses all the genetic modification so we go back to the original seed, we go actively  to the original growth what would be interesting to see if you can grow genetically modified seed which is now prevalent everywhere soaked in the CO2 water and at the same time then after now soaking them withdraw them and cultivate them and see if they grow different and the others.<br>凯：我们看见用这个系统，如果种子经过基因改造，当你使用CO2甘斯水或者甘斯直接用在材料上，你会发现这些被一些想要控制种子的组织进行基因改造的结构，因为这个种子不在它的DNA里面，它是在表面，是新的，不是结构的一部分，它会失去所有经过基因改造的部分，所以我们就回到最初的种子上，回到原来正常的生长中，这是很有趣的，你们看到现在到处都是泛滥转基因，将它们浸泡在CO2甘斯水里，浸泡它，取出来，培养它，看是否与其他的会长的不一样<br>[Gatwa]: I will definitely want to do that.<br>噶：我肯定会那样做的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The thing is as you seen the Keshe foundation innovation centre we will show you we are producing copper pipes which is nano coated outside for water the potatoes for examples we are water the agriculture lab where when the field interact with the water they behave like a fertiliser so it will be interesting to see that the growth becomes more rapid that if we don’t just water them on their own but you use water of the, water energize in a way of plasmatically and you water them, maybe you getter bigger size potatoes because now you just watering in natural so not only we put the seeds of the potatoes originally in the water of gans but we water them with the system where the gans the energy of it becomes part of the water itself so it continues to get energizes. It will be interesting to see the size of the potatoes of the potatoes grows or the seasons become shorter for the harvesting would that, it can harvest maybe in a shorter time.<br>凯：另一个事情是你会看见凯史基金会创新中心，我们会向你们展示我们正在制作外面进行纳米涂层的铜管，可以用作为土豆浇水的管子，当你在农业实验中用水时，场就会与水产生互动，使得水表现就像一种肥料，所以这是很有趣的看生长是否变得更快了，如果我们不仅仅是用水浇灌，而是将水变为一种等离子体态的能量，然后再浇灌它们，或许你会得到更大的土豆，而现在你只是用自然中的水在浇灌，所以我们可以不仅将土豆的种子浸泡在甘斯水里，而且我们可以用系统来浇灌它们，也就是使甘斯或者能量成为水的一部分，这样它就会持续的得到能量，这会很有趣看见土豆的尺寸不断变大，收获的季节变得越来越短，或许收获会在一个很短的时间内。<br>[Gatwa]: and I think that is possibly most likely to happen because I only washed them in water and CO2 gans on the day of planting and I have water them for example weekly I am not sure about the other changes or materials<br>噶：我认为那是可能的，很可能会发生的，因为我只是在下种的当天用水与CO2甘斯浸泡了一下，比如我浸泡它们达到一周的话，我不确定，会有其他的改变<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  would you test out again when you go back to Kenya or anybody who is testing.<br>凯：你可以在回到肯尼亚之前测试一下，或者任何在测试中的人<br>[Gatwa]: Oh definitely I will test I will test harvesting period even in many ways like I will test for example B matures and I will test both I have other probes in doubles and I will test when the others matured like A plot and lot of differences this has potential to bring out a lot differences that are not so obvious<br>噶：肯定的，即使在成熟的阶段我也会通过各种方式测试，比如我会在B区成熟的阶段测试，我会使用其他的探测仪，我会测试比如A区的成熟阶段，有大量的不同，这会在不很明显的地方带来大量的不同点（的测试对照）<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Carry on please<br>凯：请继续<br>[Gatwa]: Say that again<br>噶：再说一遍<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I said carry on please you were speaking<br>凯：我说请继续，你刚才还在说话<br>[Gatwa]: no I just finished I said that we have seen just a few, resorts but others can materialize when I continue with the research and of course I will not only test potatoes but other crops too<br>噶：不，我说完了，我在说我们看见一些实现目的方法，但是用其他方法可以实现，我会继续这个研究，当然我不会仅仅测试土豆，我也会测试其他的农作物<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much. What would be interesting seeing to see if you can we seen a lot of report done by our people who supported the keshe foundation people in South America reporting the same kind of thing it’s not the first time we see it. If you go on the Spanish speaking part of the Keshe foundation you will see them they have done tests with chillies and other things and they report it even putting gans in there. What would be interesting to see if the when you water these plants and you spray with the same water on the leaves this will create an environment that the pest cannot live in it so it can use not only as a fertiliser but as a pesticide too?<br>凯：很感谢。这是很有趣的看见，我们看见来自南美凯史基金会的大量相关的报告，在报告同样的事情，这已经不是我们第一次看见了。如果你去凯史基金会西班牙语区，你会看见他们已经对辣椒以及其他东西做了很多测试，他们报告说将甘斯放在里面。这是很有趣的看见，当你把这些水浇灌农作物，同时将水喷洒在叶子上，这样会创造一个害虫无法生存的环境，所以这个水不仅可以用来作为肥料还可以用来作为杀虫剂。<br>[Gatwa]: Yes<br>噶：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: This is going to be fundamentally important even in the water in your potatoes if you have also self-worms or whatever how much of the harvest is lost because of the what they call sub terrain animals in a way eating into it. So we think from our experiments in the past that once you done this because exactly what you have done I have done about 10 years ago and what is interesting is that the what I call permafrost in the countries where there is frost we seen it with the Chinese in the Chinese teaching it will make the plant even frost resistant, we know this already from Chinese group of the Keshe foundation when they showed us the Chinese cabbages before so what will be interesting to see if the plant gets benefited both the watering and  the same water can be creating a new environment that does not allow or does not require use of pesticides.<br>凯：这是一个具有基础性重要的作用，即使在水中，在你的土豆里，都有自生的害虫，有多少收成损失了，因为潜在的亚生动物在啃食它们，所以从我们过去的实验中得出，一旦你做这个实验，因为我做的和你是一样的，我在10年前就已经做过，有趣的是在一些国家中的永久冻土，那里有霜冻，如在中国，在中国的教学中它可以使植物甚至变得具有抗霜冻的能力，我们已经从凯史基金会中国团队看到这样的情况，当时他们展示给我们看的是卷心菜。所以有趣的是如果作物可以从这个水中得到这样双重的好处，同样这样的水也可以创造一个不需要使用杀虫剂的新的环境。<br>[Gatwa]: Yes<br>噶：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What is interesting in our research in the past and I will see a lot the results coming from different parts of the world is we don’t go out to do what the present farming does the present farming uses so much pesticide that it enter the cycle of the food itself that it normally the other because when we use pesticide it drops down on the flow when it get washed by the rain or whatever and it becomes part of the food chain in one way or another. This way the food and the pesticide and in a way when you use the pesticide you kill the animal and it’s not the way it works we change the whole course so the way we see the work of the CO2 or CH3 you can even use CH3 you see a better result sometime from the CH3 the conversion is much better, you change the environment that the animals don’t want to live in it you don’t kill their life you change the environment that life which exists as the potato exists on its own merit.<br>凯：在我们过去的研究中有趣的是，我们看见来自世界各地大量的结果，我们不需要出去做目前农业所需的程序，目前的农业使用了如此多的杀虫剂，这些杀虫剂进入到食物链或者其他中，因为当我们使用杀虫剂，它通过雨水或者其他什么流下来，以某种方式成为食物链的一部分，这种方式，这种食物和杀虫剂在某种程度上，当你使用杀虫剂的时候你就杀死了动物，这不是有效果的方式，你改变了整个循环链，我们看见CO2或者CO3甘斯起到的作用，你甚至可以使用CH3，你有时可以看见一个更好的结果，CH3转换效果更好。你改变了环境，动物就不想要住在里面，你就不用杀死它们；你改变了环境，生命就像土豆一样依靠自身而存在。<br>[Gatwa]: and I have seen that way because I don’t use pesticide I grown organic and I have seen that when they have vigorous growth pest will not like plants that are very healthy.<br>噶：我已经看到那样的情况了，因为我没有使用杀虫剂，我看到它们精神充沛的生长，害虫不喜欢这样的植物，所以植物生长的很健康<br>[Mr. Keshe]: it’s a way when a plant creates, plants create gravitational magnetic field which is suite to the need of the energy of the pests that’s what they come to it, when you energize a plant a shrub or a tree of whatever you give it an environment that it does not suite the pest so with this technology we don’t need any pesticide we are done with and we need ot understand that you have to keep on its not just use pesticide once and its gone and you do a second time with this as you water every day you can put the energize system the gans in it that the water creates a continuous environment that is not suiting this is important I think and we should consider it and monitor it that we can change this back to the African nations where as you said in the countries especially like sub-Sahara the water is short so if you can create by water gans just the same copper tubes behind the copper wires make it to make to copper tube that the water goes through it and you can show us that the growth becomes to let’s say 4 weeks we get what you have instead of 8 weeks or 10 weeks and in the place where we seen with the hunger and everything else the growth can be very short the harvest is not that lost and you don’t need that much water.<br>凯：从某种程度上说，植物创造了自己的能够满足虫子能量需求的磁引力场，这就是为什么它们会来的原因，当你给一个植物、灌木丛或者树充能，你就创造了一个不适合虫子的环境，所以使用这项科技我们就不需要杀虫剂了，与杀虫剂告别了，我们需要理解你要一直保持用，不是像杀虫剂一样这次用了，完了，然后用第二次，你可以每天浇水，你可以使用具有甘斯的能量系统，这样水就创造一个不适合（虫害的）持续的环境，这是很重要的，我认为我们应该对其进行计算并监测，我们可以将这个改变带到非洲国家，就如你所说的一些国家，尤其是亚撒哈拉，那里水是短缺的，所以如果你能创造甘斯水，就是一样的铜管，用铜线做成的铜管，让水经过它，你可以向我们展示生长的情况，比如原来是8个星期或者10个星期，变为现在的4个星期，我们看见一些地方伴随着饥饿以及其他事情，使用这项科技生长可以变得短暂，收成不会损失，你也不需要那么多的水<br>[Gatwa]: yes I agree of course I also as I said I am organic so I never use pesticide in the past.<br>噶：是的，我同意，当然，就像我说的，这是有机性的，我从没有使用杀虫剂<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So if you can use and see the effect with the pesticide even if our Chinese community was listing can  do such a test for us because they are very good in testing in their field or other countries we can change the course of all the chemicals which is going into our food chain because you don’t need you don’t add you just change the environment which they pass which does not need to live without affecting the food itself<br>凯：所以如果你使用杀虫剂的话，就可以看见杀虫剂的影响效果，即使我们的中国团队也可以为我们做这样一个测试，因为他们很擅长在自己的领域或者其他国家进行这样的测试，我们能够改变这个进入到我们食物链中化学的进程，因为你不需要，你不用添加，你只是需要改变环境，它们会经过这个环境而不用住在这个环境里面，从而就不影响到作物的生长<br> [Gatwa]: I agree<br>噶：我同意<br>[Mr. Keshe]: That’s fantastic so we hopefully thank you very much for your participation and as I said Doctor we welcome you to the Keshe foundation as you are heading to Kenya to head the Keshe foundation Kenya for us and the Keshe foundation makes everything possible in creating agricultural environment and whatever you decide to do as a scientist we support it and we finance it through the Keshe foundation.<br>凯：这是极好的，所以我们希望，很感谢你的参与，就像我说的，博士，我们欢迎你加入到凯史基金会，你来为我们领导肯尼亚基金会的运作，凯史基金会在创造农业环境方面能够让一切变得可能，无论你的决定是什么，作为一个科学家，我们会支持，我们会通过凯史基金会进行资助<br>[Gatwa]: Thank you very much<br>噶：真的很感谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much indeed I hope you don’t forget to stay student because we need your knowledge.<br>凯：很感谢你，我希望你不要忘记你还是学生，我们需要你的知识<br>[Gatwa]: oh no I won’t forget,<br>噶：不，我不会忘记<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much for your time.<br>凯：很感谢你的时间<br>[Gatwa]: Sure<br>噶：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you indeed, can we share.<br>凯：很感谢你，我们能够分享…<br>[Gatwa]: I will stop mine<br>噶：我会关掉我的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you stop sharing that we can take it to the next teaching. Move please thank you, thank you very much for your time. Rick what is the next surprise for us.<br>凯：你能够停止你那里的分享吗，这样我们可以进行下一步教学。继续，谢谢。谢谢的你的时间。现在，瑞克，下一个等待我们的惊喜是什么。<br>[Rick]: Well we do, we might have something from David Contraros, David he was speaking CO2 you have maybe an update on your farming situation. I will unmute you see if you can speak there.<br>瑞克：恩，我可能会从大卫康丘那里看到一些东西，大卫他说CO2用在农业种植上得到了一些改善，我会给你静音，这样你就可以说话了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: From Brazil?<br>凯：来自巴西？<br>[Rick]: Are you from Mexico or Brazil<br>瑞克：你来自墨西哥还是巴西？<br>[David]: No Mexico<br>大卫：不，是墨西哥<br>[Rick]:Mexico Yes<br>瑞克：墨西哥，好的<br>[David]: Okay can you hear me well?<br>大卫：好，听见我说话了吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes very well<br>凯：是的，很清楚<br>[David]: Okay I want to follow you guys first for you know being a little behind right now with these experiments, the farm had taken a lot of my time here for this cycle where are this point I am growing the wheat as we wanted to this year automatically and I wanted to do just a little report of what happened last year with my corn it really was a success with what I seen…<br>大卫：好的，我要抱歉的是，在这些实验上我有一点落在后面，在这个周期农场耗费我这里大量的时间，在这个时间点，我正在种植小麦，我想要在今年进行自动化生产，我想要做，我们有一些去年关于我的玉米的报告，那真的是一个成功，我看见的是…<br>[Rick]: Excuse me David do you have any visual we can put on the screen.<br>瑞克：抱歉，大卫，你有什么图片吗，这样我们可以放在屏幕上<br>[David]: I sent you a lot of pictures to webmaster can you have access to those one from the processing unit for my wheat  this circle<br>大卫：我寄送了大量的图片给网站站长，你能从那里得到，是我在这个周期里用在小麦上的装置[Mr. Keshe]: Vince are you there?<br>凯：文斯，你在那里吗？<br>[David]: a lot of the pictures to you.<br>大卫：我传送了大量的图片给你<br>[Rick]: I am not webmaster so you are not sending them to me you are sending them to Vince he is the webmaster.<br>瑞克：我不是站长，你传送的不是我，而是传给了文斯，他是站长<br>[David]: Okay because<br>大卫：好，因为<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Just wait a second please let him find, Vince you better show the pictures or send them to Rick to show<br>凯：请等一下，让他找找，文斯你最好展示这些图片或者传给瑞克<br>[David]: alright what happened I had crushed a couple of my systems so I have a lot of very interesting information for last year one of my plants got crushed and everything went to the hard drive and I was never able to recover a lot on information but I do have of stuff going down with the way right now with the farm and now with<br>大卫：所发生的是，我压坏了我的很多系统，去年我有很多有趣的信息，我的一个电脑崩坏了，所有的东西都在硬盘，我没能恢复好很多信息，我做了很多关于农业种植的实验<br>[Mr. Keshe]: When did your system crash?<br>凯：你的系统什么时候崩溃了？<br>[David]: like 2 months ago the thing crashed and I couldn’t recover a lot of info and I did have some backup so those of my videos of my corn in that I kept sending some pictures before of the different corns that I adapted and I did have almost 7 varieties corn that I harvest in I am ready for the cycle to repeat the growth I am preparing the land right now for the coiler corn I call it the collar corn because this are collar variety that I did on spring time in my first phase last year and now I want to repeat the experiment to see if what I saw last year repeats this time because there were times as I wrote to you Mr. Keshe about the corn producing corns on the male flower on top something that I never saw even the corn was losing grain in the male flower it wasn’t producing corn in the centre as they usually do and observe these anomalies and I took some pictures there are some pictures that I got from stuff that I am recovering but I can show you the corn hanging from the male flower on top of the corn and<br>大卫：大约2个月前，这个东西崩溃了，我没有能够恢复很多信息，我做了一些备份，里面有一些关于玉米的视屏，之前我一直在传送我种植的不同玉米图片，我种植了有7个不同品种的玉米，现在我准备在这个周期重新开始种植，我现在正在为我的玉米耕耘土地，我叫做领衔-玉米，因为这个玉米品种我是在去年春天第一阶段下种的，现在我想要重复这个实验，看这次是否能够看到重复去年的结果，因为，有几次我写信给你，凯史先生，关于玉米生产，在顶部的雄株花朵，这是我以前从没看见的，玉米在雄株花朵上结出谷粒，而不是像平常那样在中间生产出谷粒，我注意到这个异常现象，拍了一些图片，有一些图片在我的设备的丢失了，我正在恢复，我可以向你展示垂挂在顶部的雄株花朵上的穗麦<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you lets go back step by step, you did this and what did you use you used CO2 gans what was the process?<br>凯：你能，让我们一步步来，你做这个是用的CO2甘斯吗，你的处理过程是什么？<br>[David]: Yes that was preface of the, of the corn I did kind, I set the conditions to use a lot of CO2 and also use around the plot the same systems or the cycles I put a few I gave you the tips to hoses around the ground to put the permanent fertiliser as I was watering the plot, I  put the circle around the plot of CO2 then I put the middle circle CH3 and there put the third corn a small one lke the reactor type of thing, within the field I used the 3 gans as a field in my corn plot in my field. I did have a lot of harvest to those and it was the plan there people who came to most of my field and we improvise we make a lot sweets we do with the corn here and everybody enjoy the corn and I kept almost a type of the seed that I selected for this year you know from a variety of colours to a variety of what they call the lines of the corn, I have  started some of the seed from south Mexico and north Mexico and the seeds, those are one of the pictures yes from my third stage where corns where showing 3 shoots sometimes 2 shoots in the growing process and a lot of those corns and showing the different corns they were producing 3,4, 5 corns the plant some of those they developed well they even they grow more size they still produce some seeds in this small corn they didn’t produce as a, yes they are okay. Yeah you can show, that has to do with a little with cap of what I did in the 2015 but I still have some other success, this is my wheat right now my wheat that I just planted on the 14th of January this wheat is producing 7 shoots and I am try to see this wheat is gonna produce more than as you has you the wheat is gonna behave as grass and produce more shoots I already the first one that I planted and this little plant is always a branching to 7 shoots that means its gonna<br>大卫：是的，在最开始对我的玉米，我设置的条件是使用大量的CO2，也在我的地基的周围用上同样的系统，我用上一些，给你一个提示，使用CO2软作为在土地周围的永久性的肥料，当我用水浇灌这个试验田的时候；我在地基周围用上CO2甘斯，在中心的圆圈我用上CH3，然后在一个很小的圆圈里放上反应器之类的东西，是在这个场域内，我在我的地基里用了3种甘斯作为一种场，我收割了很多，这是一个计划，很多人来到我的田地，我们用玉米做了很多糖果，每个人都很享受这个玉米，我几乎保持着一个品种的玉米，我选择它作为今年下种的，从不同的颜色到不同的玉米线性品种，我也用了一些墨西哥南部与北部的玉米种子，这是其中一个图片 ，是第三阶段，在生长过程中发了3个芽，有时2个芽，大多数这些玉米，就像这些不同的玉米，生产出3，4，5个玉米棒，它们中一些长的很好，即使它们生长出更大的尺寸，它们还是在小的玉米中生产出一些种子，它们不像…生产，是的，它们是，好，是的，你可以展示，你要处理一些帽盖，就像我在2005年做的，但我还有其他方面成功的案例，这是我的小麦，是在1月14号下种的，这个小麦发了7个芽 ，这样的小麦长的更多，就像杂草一样生产处更多的芽，这是我种植的第一批，<br>这个小的种植作物总会有7个枝芽，这就意味着…，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: This is what we reported here for years ago. So usually it should be one shoot am I correct.<br>凯：这是我们几年前报告过的。通常它应该只有一个枝芽，对吗？<br>[David]: not really there are some variety who they have more than one shoot and this one I am trying to see as the mass grows the week I can recall more like bunch growing around one seed, this is only seed from this variety this is the hard wheat from the area from this area from here, even though the wheat as I wanted to do organic growing practically the time was critical to get the seed and I go the see that regularly everyone is planting but what I did for the seed the seed was blown into the ground then with the big tractor I did a mixture of the 3 gans and I coated the seed before it was buried by the tractor that was my treatment of the nano coating of the seed.<br>大卫：不完全是的，有一些品种可以超过一个芽，这一个我想要看作为一个大量种植的方式，就像在一个种子周围一捆似的生长，这就是一个品种的种子，这就是当地的硬粒小麦，我想要种植有机物，实际上现在是获取种子的关键时期，我看见现在每个人都在种植，我对种子做的是，种子向土里膨胀，在我用大拖拉机将种子掩埋之前，我做了3个甘斯的混合物，然后给种子涂上了，这就是我对种子进行纳米涂层的方式。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you please repeat that again please repeat that gain please<br>凯：你能够再重复一下吗？再重复一下<br>[David]: We got the regular seed that everybody was using here in the area the was a call to plant about 500 hectares of wheat in the area and I decide to be a outside of the chemical thing and just apply gans not anything. Everybody is applying urea and everything you know the different chemical and over seeing another plot from another grower that he is growing the same stuff but with the urea and I am using the application of the gans with my fertilising I am creating I sent some pictures about the fertilisers which you gave me about using the bone using you know the nano coated hoses to put in the ground for my vegetables I only started this cycle for my vegetables and for more corn but I have 4 and half hectares of wheat by growing with gans and I divided the lines in 2 parts in 2 2 hectares one side I put only CO2 I mix that with like a fine 500 litres of mixture that had been put gans and the fertilisers I had been creating and I sprayed the seed before it was buried that’s what I explained in the beginning the other one has the 3 gans CH3, CO2 and copper and with silver gans all of them were extracted from sea water and that’s the treatment that I did for the land at this point I am going to start throwing my nano materials as I did before you know my nails my pieces of metal all around the area that’s an extra treatment I am going to the land, the reason I am going this is, is because close to the area that I live these one of my units this is my energy units that I am going to be using around my water when it comes to my land.<br>大卫：我们用的就是这个地区每个人都在用的平常的种子，在这个地区一般都是种植500公顷的土地，我决定不用化学用剂，只是使用甘斯，每个人都在使用尿素以及不同的化学用剂，我看其他的种植者也是种植一样的东西，但用的是尿素，而我用的是甘斯作为我的创造出来的化肥，我发送了一些化肥的图片，你建议我用骨头，以及纳米涂层软管，放在土地里作为蔬菜的化肥，我刚开始应用到我的蔬菜上，而在玉米上用的时间更多。我有4.5公顷种植小麦的土地用的是甘斯，我在土地上画了一条线分为2个部分，在一边我只是使用CO2甘斯，我做了500升甘斯与肥料的混合，在掩埋之前我喷涂在种子上，这就是我开始所解释的；另一边是3种甘斯，CH3，CO2以及铜甘斯与银甘斯，它们都是从海水中提取的，这就是我为土地进行的处理，这一次我会放上纳米材料就像我以前做的，我的铁钉以及大小的金属块遍布这个区域，这就是我对这块土地做的额外处理，我这样做的原因是很接近我居住的区域，这个是我的装置中的一个，这是我的能量单元，我准备用在浇灌我的土地的水上</p>
<p>This has the same idea of the health blueprint  what you put these coils for the body well I want use it for the water I want to put 2 of those coils where the water comes out to energize the water into also neutralize any chemicals. This is my corn that I have from last year and they have been in the plasmatic soaking this type of ours is a device that I used produce a field around the corn that’s its going to prepare for planting this has a double wall container that has the 3 gans and I am using the field for a couple weeks you know around the corns you know the different. These are already finished this according to the number of lines that each corn was producing, I got corn from 8 lines you know 12 14 16 18 lines these are popcorn this variety these are one of the variety of popcorn that I got. ON this variety even there were close to coordinate this variety were joined and normally its 2 it growing 5 corns of growing in different like one corn will come on the top of the plane instead of the main flower, and at the same time at the side of the corn you will see a little corn made in branch that’s how the corn grow you know with the male braches pollinate they mirror what the appears are of the corn and these are one of the price that I have used the red corns and the pink and I also got yellow mixtures and some purper mixture corns that I got in the harvesting time.<br>大卫：这是来自医疗蓝图中的一样的想法，你们把线圈用在身体上，那我也可以用在水上，我将其中2个线圈放在水出来的地方，从而给水供能，也可以中和任何化学物质。这是我的去年的玉米，而且它们都经过等离子体式的浸泡 ，这种形状的设置我用来创造出围绕玉米的一种场，这是准备要下种的，有两个容器壁，用了3种甘斯，在几周中我在玉米周围持续的创造这样一个场，你知道不同之处。 这个图片里的形状是根据玉米生产出来的线性数目而来的，玉米有8条，12，14，16，18条，这个品种是爆米花，是我所有的爆米花品种中的一个。这个品种，是接近协调的 ，这个品种通常是2个，<br>生长出来5个或者长的不同就像一个玉米一样在直径顶部出现一个玉米枝而不是珠花，同时在玉米的边上，在枝上出现小的玉米，这就是玉米如何生长的，你们知道主枝授粉，能够反映玉米所发生的事情。<br>这是另一个品种，红色的，粉色的，还有黄色混合与紫色混合的，这些都是在收获的时候得到的。<br>Now I can say I am liking this corn to do my spring phase where I want to plant these seeds again and it’s going to be the 3rd time the original the one that I have, and this is going to be the third time that I am planting the same seed all of these were grown with the nano materials some of these were sprayed with the gans in my third phase I used only CO2 and I can say a couple times I did a bit with copper you know to just you know kill some pesticides in the ground in case there were some but I didn’t see any problems with the thing the only thing I did the yield after yield because the circle was little off, this is the container that I use to put the gans to spray the 500 litres of mixture of CO2 with the fertilisers that I reducing you know to some. This is one litre of gans that I used of CO2, CH3 and the copper oxide that I used my 500 litres they are half you know of the land.<br>大卫：现在我可以说将这些玉米运用到春季播种阶段，我想要再次下种这些种子，这是在这个季节第三次进行，第一次我收获了，这是第三次我要播种同样的种子，这些玉米生长中都运用了纳米材料，其中一些在我的第三阶段喷洒了甘斯，我只用了CO2甘斯，可以说有几次我用了氧化铜甘斯，虽然它可以杀死一些田里的东西，但我没看到有什么问题；唯一的事情是，在不断收获之后，这个圆圈有些消失了。<br>这是我用来在500公顷土地上喷洒甘斯的容器，里面是我制作的CO2甘斯与肥料的混合物；这些是一些甘斯， ，有co2，CH3，以及氧化铜甘斯，用在我的500公顷的土地上，一半的土地上<br>[Mr. Keshe]: so you didn’t use any chemicals or used<br>凯：所以你没有使用任何化学品<br>[David]: Nope not all chemicals only the gans and…<br>大卫i：没有用化学剂，只是甘斯<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask you a question before you go any further because you said a lot you giving us a lot of information because first of all we are processing it in a natural way. The other thing which is interesting to know is did you see any parasites in your structure compared to the other farmers?<br>凯：在你继续之前，我能问你一个问题吗，因为你说了很多，你给了我们大量的信息，因为首先我们是在用一种自然的方式进行处理。另一件有趣的事情是需要知道相比其他的农民，你在你的田地发现了有任何寄生虫吗？<br>[David]: Right now as the water, water I am serving right now is between myself and another one we planted the seed almost the same day. My seed the wheat has grown almost twice in, at that time I had only given 2 irrigation and this persons has given more than 3 irrigations than me and they put urea and still my wheat is almost twice bigger than them. And today I did some digging and that’s where I found that the wheat is experiencing from 3 to 7 shoots per seed it producing a lot of shoots I am hoping that’s it going to be more shoots I hope that it will be more concentrated that the…<br>大卫：现在我所服务的区域是在我自己的田地以及另一个人之间，我们几乎是在同一天下种的，我的小麦种子长的几乎是2倍，期间，我只是进行了2个浇灌，而那个人进行了超过3次的浇灌，他们用了尿素，然而我的小麦几乎还是比他们2倍大，那是我服务的区域。今天我做了一些挖掘，发现每个小麦种子已经从3个芽变成7个芽，它生长出很多的芽，我希望它会长出更多的芽，我希望它会集中….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask you a question because you now is your third year harvesting with CO2<br>凯：我能问你一个问题吗，因为这是你使用CO2甘斯进行种植的第三年<br>[David]: With the nano material, yes since I start but this<br>大卫：用纳米材料，是的，自从我开始用，但是这个土地…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What I want to ask you do you see because you must have been farming years before, if you have such a reference or you can compare to the other farmers in your area what is your harvest change is it less it it equal or you harvest more?<br>凯：我想要问的是，你看见，因为你一定从事农业种植多年了，如果你有这样的参照，或者你可以在你的区域与其他农民进行对照，你的收成有什么改变，是变少了还是相等的，还是收成变多了<br>[David]: The situation is very interesting here for example wheat, wheat what happens they grown for a few years in this areas and now we wheat is come back to be grown and I don’t have any comparisons right now because of that, this year is going to be my comparison time with this type of growth like I said its new. Oh okay maybe young my such … pretty sure I am myself on, let’s say I don’t have right number in my other system and that’s why I am kind of holding the phone.<br>大卫：情况是很有趣的，比如他们在这里种植小麦已经有很多年了，我们只是刚回来种植，所以我没有其他的参照，今年是我对这种新型的种植进行比较的一年，哦，或许是年轻的，我的这样的…我是我自己，在我的系统中没有正确的号码，这就是为何我拿着我的电话<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah but what is interesting did you have any reduction last year compared to the second first year in harvest on this thing.<br>凯：有趣的是，相比第二年，去年你在收成上有任何减少吗？<br>[David]: Okay last year what I did grow is what some plant of the corn some vegetables I did have a lot of success in the vegetables that I grow in this bed you see in front, I put a lot of lettuce I put a lot of cabbage  broccoli and cauliflower, I grew the different way with the, amazed with what I harvest because he was, he will work 10 days outside in the heat and will come home withered its strong high  hydrated with the gans and at the same time structure wise.<br>大卫：好，去年我种植的是一些玉米以及蔬菜，在蔬菜上我取得了很大的成功，我种植在这个前面的田地里 ，我用了很多生菜，大白菜，青花菜以及油菜花，当我收获的时候，人们对它的长势感到惊讶，因为在外面是持续的高温，取回来的时候一般都会枯萎，但是它还是保持高水分，有甘斯，同时这个结构…，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Stop, stop please, no because it’s important let’s just bring something very important in line because we got to learn from you, are the tester. You said the plant does not dehydrate.<br>凯：停下，停下，因为很重要，让我们说一下很重要的事情，因为我需要从你那里学习，你是一位实验者，你说这个植物不会脱水<br>[David]; No it didn’t dehydrate it took a long time for the plant to really go you know to whither outside and I left it on purpose outside on my house you know when I was, dealing in the what I call the box. It’s called the Okani box for everybody, you know everybody was getting a box with you know 2 lettuce one some cabbage and then putting some lettuce and putting some radishes. I was making a little you know a small box for everybody who was just ordering these thing from the organic test I was wrong and those will get strong you know outside, even in the June and July when the heat  is strong you know the plants will last longer you know with the application you know<br>大卫：是的，它不会脱水，植物在外面用了很长时间才枯萎，我有意的将它放在我的房子外面，当我处理这个盒子时，每个人都叫Okani盒子，每个人有一个盒子，2个卷心菜，一个大白菜，放卷心菜，放一些萝卜，我也在为每个人制作一个小的盒子，他们想要从我这里订购这个有机物，我错了。它们在外面会变得更强壮，即使是在6月，7月温度很高的时候，这些作物会持续很长时间，应用这项科技的话。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we see the reverse with the Chinese agriculture you bought, they showed us that the plant will not freeze so the CO2 works on both ways both as a stop dehydration and on the other hand it stop the frost the frost cannot affect it because the Chinese don’t put field next to each other because clearly you see the difference.<br>凯：我们看见中国团队在中国农业应用上带来的逆转，他们向我们展示植物不会冻坏，所以CO2甘斯起到双重作用，一方面使得植物不脱水，另一方面可以抵抗霜冻影响，因为中国团队在田地里将实验组与对照组放在一起，我们很清楚看到这个区别。<br>[David]: yeah I do have a little problem with that part you know I post a strain of CO2 in my corn at the end of the year and one day the pro came it did kind of you know affect the leaves of the corn because the plan still kept alive till the end of the cycle from my corn that I harvest it you know and even though I put the rings of protection on one the around the plot still you know the corn got a little hit with that still a lot of sheep were saved and I didn’t…<br>大卫：是的，我确实在那部分有一点问题，在年末我将CO2甘斯放在我的玉米上，一天寒冻来临了，它确实对玉米的叶子有影响，但在这个气候周期结束，当我收割玉米时，植物仍然存活了下来，尽管我把起保护作用的圆环放在田地周围，还是有一些玉米受到寒冻的影响，但有大量的被拯救过来了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: but if you didn’t use CO2 what was your opinion, the difference.<br>凯：但是如果不用CO2，你认为有什么不同？<br>[David]: I will see, if you it has I will the application CO2 if it would help I did so it would grow the corn and a lot of corn was grown in that spot because in that 3rd phase that’s the one that I used the application of the gans in the other plant  I used the application of the nano materials in the ground but not those that I sprayed with the gans as I did with the last phase.<br>大卫：我想要说运用CO2起到帮助作用，在那个田地里大量的玉米生长出来了，在第3阶段我使用的是甘斯，在其他的作物上我用的是纳米材料，不是像我上一阶段那样喷洒甘斯，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: They say there is no photos in the line, rick, sorry one second. There is a message there is no photos on the live stream Rick, can you check please. I see okay carry on.<br>凯：他们说上面没有相关的图片，瑞克。稍等，有一条信息上说屏幕上没有相关的照片，瑞克。你能检查一下吗，看见了，好，继续。<br>[David]: Alright the when did the application of the gans for this plant for the purpose of the corn that’s when I saw the anomalies in the corn where I would see you male flowers producing corn. When you said some time that the plants will reverse you know make up the blueprint. Where the corn what’s grown in the Americans in different warehouse we have adapted the corn to this time and I saw grains coming on the male flower on top like a like the wheat you know like the and other plants that would produce the grains like wheat but those grains where on the top.<br>大卫：在将甘斯应用到玉米上是，我所看到的异常现象是，雄珠花生产出玉米了。当你有时说植物会逆转，这成为蓝图的一部分，玉米可以在美国不同仓库里生长，我们要让玉米适应这里的气候与时令，我看见谷粒在雄珠花顶部生长出来，就像小麦一样，其他的作物也会像小麦一样生产出谷粒，那些谷粒都在顶部<br>[Mr. Keshe]: could you  harvest them because you.<br>凯：你能收割它们吗？<br>[David]: Where you would harvest the birds I wanted to protect some of the plants you know the birds appear to just have appeared with some of those, but I can’t…<br>大卫：当收割的时候，一些鸟，我想要保护一些作物，你知道一些鸟出现在附近，但我不能…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I, can be, can I ask a question I am going back to ask a question if you wanted male and female and you saw the males growing seeds as females.<br>凯：我能回过头来问一个问题吗？如果你用雄性与雌性种子，你看见雄性种子也能像雌性种子一样生产出种子<br>[David]: No it doesn’t work like that with the corn. Corn it pollinates by itself corn has the male flower on top and the ears have the little heads that receive the pollen. This plant will have on the same part, the top part it would produce a little corn coming from the male flower it will hand the corn and that the one of the pieces that I lost I am trying to regroup the thing to a piece where you can see the little corn hanging from the top not in the centre where the corn regular grows you know. And also some of the corn the little only made it fact that have the main flower will produce or it was producing the seeds on top instead from the corn as a way how the corn grows you know these male flowers where producing seed corn seed.<br>大卫：不是，玉米不是这样的。玉米是通过自己进行授粉，在顶部有一个雄珠花，它的穗有一个头部接受花粉，这个作物会在顶部从雄珠花上生产出一点玉米，它会支撑玉米，这也是我失去的一部分资料，我试图重组系统，在图片上你能看见一点玉米垂挂在顶部，而不是平常如在玉米的中间生长出来。而且一些玉米，少部分玉米的雄珠花会在顶部生产或已经生产种子，而不是来自于玉米原本的生长方式，这些雄珠花会生产出玉米种子。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay now what I want to come to you is just to add something just to others who are online just listen to this maybe they can enlighten us but it’s a question which raises and a question raises did the male come first or the female of does the female has come from the male. If the male section is producing fruit or corn does the process change the going back to the origin did the man come first or the female come first.<br>凯：好，现在我想要增加一些东西，其他在线的人可能会给我们一些启发，但是一个提出的问题，雄性种子是最先的，还是雌性种子是最先的，还是雌性种子来自于雄性种子？如果雄性部分在生产水果或者玉米，这个过程能够还原到最初，男人先出现还是女人先出现？<br>[David]: But what I am observing right not with the corn I am trying to repeat the experiment to see if I get this opportunity, this opportunity that I am preparing for energizing the water the same way with the health machine I wanna be…<br>大卫：但我现在对玉米的观察，我想要重复这个实验，看是否我有这样的机会，我在准备给这个水充能，就像医疗装置所做的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Where are you putting this? Where are you putting this unit?<br>凯：你把这个装置放在那里？<br>[David]: Where the water comes out it show my 4 stars you know.<br>大卫：放在水出来的地方，这是星型组合。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah I remember that<br>凯：是，我记得<br>[David]: This where I put it around this is the pipe that’s where the water for the land, I am going to be putting those and I am going to be broadcasting around here in the structure similar with the health machine like the one Reina is doing I am put this and I am going to broadcast my different fertilisers and also I wanted to energize the ones, all this are nano coated and ready to be energized.<br>大卫：我放在管道周围，管子出的水用来浇灌土地 ，我想要放上那些，我想要在周围播种，如同健康装置的结构一样，就像瑞娜所做的，我放在这里，我再用不同的肥料在周围施肥，我也想要给它供能，所有这些都进行了纳米涂层，准备接受能量。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think you need to cover them that you don’t loose the coating, you have to cover if you are hanging these things<br>凯：我认为你需要覆盖它们，这样就不会让涂层松散，你得覆盖它们，如果你这样悬挂的话<br>[David]: The water, that’s gonna be outside<br>大卫：水会出来的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Ah<br>凯：哦<br>[David]: That’s going to be closed way to flow the water because the water pump.<br>大卫：这样接近流动的水，因为水…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Why don’t you put your coil around the pipe itself?<br>凯：为什么你将线圈放在管道的周围？（03：18：02）<br>[David]: there was another idea that I got but we did because the little tube that I have inside and doing the nano in this little containers in the right side they will have a little that will have the fertilisers that I am doing for different materials that I have the land in the round like I haven produce burn to the power and then I did burn those and I burn some corn from the last cereal and I used the corn ash with the sosa coat in a way to create the concentrate that  the moment that I use my plasmatic battery it activates the coil but I don’t know what had the field to the water in energize the water with the fertiliser at the field action you know the water it’s going to remember the memory it’s going to be energize and the thing time it’s going to be neutralize any of the chemical memories what it might have from the underground that my idea is to broadcast the way field the gans that I am creating with the different fertilisers and I am using different mineral I use different trays to create a clay mister that will have all the mineral that would go inside the water.<br>大卫：我有另一个主意，我所做的，我对里面的小管子进行纳米涂层，在右边这个小容器里， ，它们也有一些肥料，是用我的土地上不同的材料做的，比如我通过烧了灰烬从而提供能量，烧了烧了一些玉米， 我使用了玉米灰， ， ，创造一种能量的凝缩， ，我也使用到等离子体电池，它能激活线圈，这些都是为了创造场，给水提供能量，从而与肥料产生场的互动，你知道水具有记忆性，能够被充能，从而能够中和来自地下的化学元素，这些就是我的主意，播种这些场，这些甘斯，我用不同的肥料创造，我用不同的矿物质，不同的组合，创造一种粘土质，里面具有各种矿物质，让这些矿物质融入进水中。<br>As you say we broadcast this journey you know. The animals wanted to kill another prey here where why don’t we  spray  do the same thing to plants then just feed the plants the same way and I used to come through the water to use the broadcast inserts them with coils a with the help and devices why don’t we do the same thing you know but my idea is to put in te centre of the plasma field to put this, test tube, test tube that would have the concentrate there, I could use you know CH3 just might borrow or just a composite gans that would have all the fertilisers that the plant needs to grow and that’s my first time that I am creating the structure the water through the gans field you know where the water comesout the tube and that would be I started working today with the fertiliser in what I think about is the ping pong balls that have the magnetised see I nano coated the right side magnetised this little balls are going to be filled with black side magnetised nano and each ball, I want to try to duplicate the star system where the 3 balls in the centre are going to have 3 gans.<br>大卫：我们在这个流程中播种，我们看见动物想要杀死作物，这里使用了一种喷雾剂来驱赶这些动物，为什么我们不能用喷雾的方式对作物做同样的事情，用同样的方式从给植物供能呢，我们常去水边通过水管给田浇灌水源，为什么我们不做同样的事情呢？我的主意是将试管放在线圈中心的等离子体中，这样就有一个浓缩，我可以使用CH3或者复合的甘斯，这样就会有作物生长所需的所有肥料，这是我第一次创造这个结构，也就是当水从水管出来的时候经过甘斯所形成的场，我今天仍然在做肥料的事情，我想到让乒乓球具有磁性， 我对球进行纳米涂层，这些小球充满了磁性以及纳米物质，每个球，我试图复制星型系统，有三个球在中心，用了3个甘斯<br> It’s going to be filled with the magnetised nano with a different for each one and the other one is going to have a composite together. Water will float through and it will make a spiral I will repeat the same process the same the same system and I will put the 3 coils too and those too and the more they are going to get activated in the more the water proof flows through their water is going to be purified from the memory to the process of the vortex that it’s going to be created inside. I could you know protect the spirals, excuse me or I can just let it go like that and let the water run, those are already nano coated the ping pong balls and like I said they are going to be filled with the magnetised each one is going to be filled with a different gans. Plus that is going to be first section with the water comes when the water goes out its going to have a number of ping pong pall in the same upright arrangement of the fourth star but this one are going to have the different fertilisers that I want to what I want to be view and in charge of the air for the going of wheat that was one of my experiments.<br>大卫：这样就会被充满磁性纳米材料，每一个球上用不同的甘斯，它们在一起就有了一个复合的场，水会经过它，我会做一个螺旋，我会重复一样的过程，一样的系统，我也用上3个线圈，这3个线圈也会相互作用，水在这个里面的场所创造的漩涡似的结构中流经过就会得到净化。我可以保护这个螺旋，抱歉，可以让水像那样流动，那些都被纳米涂层化，这些乒乓球被充满磁性材料，每一个球都放入一个不同的甘斯。 。水经过的第一阶段是经过大量的处于同样星型结构中的乒乓球，但这一个我用了不同的肥料， ，用在浇灌小麦的水中，这是我的实验之一<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think you better cover the coils which they come in touch with the water, I think after a short time there will be no nano coat left on them.<br>凯：我认为你最好覆盖你的线圈，因为它们会与水相互接触，我认为一段时间后在它们身上就没有纳米涂层了<br>[David]: My idea is those spirals are going to be like a help, a little clear to be the, it’s going to be a clear to be, around the part that it is going to be attached to the water, if the water is going to be running through but I am hoping to be the system that Renon was doing with the tube inside the tube but he tube inside the tube is going to be magnetised with the different gans and the water flow free in the middle and that will also energize I already have experience in that system I heated, I did the tube that it’s one of the teacher I think the long tube that have the magnetised inside that’s one of my previous experiments that I did to structure the water to magnetise the reason why I say magnetised it’s because magnetised has the natural magnetism of the earth it doesn’t have the frequency provide by the<br>大卫：我的主意是这些螺旋会起到净化作用，水经过就会起到净化作用；我还是期待雷农所做的在管子里面放一个管子，但管子里面的管子是被不同的甘斯磁化的，水从中经过会被供能，我已经在这个系统上有经验，我做了这个管子，在里面的长管子具有磁性，这是我以前的实验之一，使水结构性的磁化，为什么我说磁化，因为磁化的物体具有地球的磁力，它就不具有这个频率….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Let me explain, let me correct you, you are bringing a lot of sciences together just to justify this doesn’t exist there is no frequency and there is no resonance so what you do you don’t magnetise water you magnetising is a single word but you are using called gravitational magnetically field so what you are doing you are change the plasma of the water<br>凯：让我解释一下，让我纠正一下你，你带来了大量的科学知识，并在做出解释；这根本不存在，在等离子体中没有频率，也没有什么共振，你所做的不是对水进行磁化，磁化是一个单词，你实际指的是磁引力场，你所做的是改变水的等离子体<br>[David]: Yeah<br>大卫：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The information are changed information. The plasma does not carry information it carries strength that is its information.<br>凯：信息，改变了信息。等离子体不携带信息，它只是携带强度，这就是它的信息。<br>[David]: Yeah I understand that<br>大卫：我所讲的是….是，我理解<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Because if you use the right terminology you will understand it in a correct way you are doing fantastic job I have seen your work before but the only thing is the, I think you better you cover anything that comes with water direct in your system should not be nano coated unless you can cover them that you don’t pass nano material and you pass the energy of it.<br>凯：因为你使用正确的术语，你就能正确的理解它。你在做一个极其美好的工作，我以前看见过你所做的，唯一的事情是，我认为你最好覆盖，水会直接接触你的系统，除非你覆盖好否则不要纳米涂层，你不会在经过纳米涂层，你是在穿过能量<br>[David]; Yeah my one of my advices is  the ping pong balls I did nano coat those in the outside but the magnetised its getting inside the ping pong balls the idea what I was saying before about the magnetism, I am not using in effect how the magnet are created  you know with this 60Hz current. The natural magnetism of the magnetised that I am getting it’s the natural you know stone magnetism that the planet gives you know energizes to be magnetic energized when confusing those kind of magnetised as a seal of the gans as a seal of magma.<br>大卫：是的，我的一个建议是这个乒乓球我在外面做了纳米涂层，而球里面是磁化的物质，我之前说磁化，我不是在说这个磁铁是如何被创造的，用这个60HZ电流。我说的是自然磁化的磁性，是自然的，也就是石头的磁性，具有地球给予的能量，使之具有磁性。我困惑的是那些密封的甘斯所形成的磁性，密封的岩浆<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Let put in a different way when is stone used in magnetised or you call it the stone is magnetised now that we have expanded the knowledge eh stone itself carries a plasma you get both the field it both takes and gives so now that we understand more it’s better to use the right understanding and this is important because magnets, anything especially when you put in water, water we know its hydrogen and oxygen it’s in the plasmatic condition so if you get magnetism just where we go  then where does it go what does it give you if it takes so now that we know more if you use the right terminology you increase the energy if this plasma so, so you are the teachers you are the heads of this sections in teaching us if you use the right terminology from the beginning that people understand that my favour stays in the plasma place.<br>凯：让我们换一种方式，当你所使用的石头是磁化的，或者你说这个石头是磁化的，我们扩展一下这个知识，石头本身携带着等离子体，你得到2个场—给予与获取，现在我们理解的更多，我们最好使用正确的概念，这是很重要的，因为磁铁，当你把任何东西放在水里，水是由氢与氧组成的，是一个等离子体环境，当说到磁性，它因为所获取的就会给予。所以我们知道更多，如果你使用正确的术语，你就会增加等离子体的能量，你是老师，你是这个领域的先驱，如果你从一开始就使用正确的术语，人们就会理解我倾向于等离子体的领域。<br>[David]: I want to increase the plasma field of the water through the action of the natural plasma field that the magnetic magnets I have because I am putting the gans in the mixture of the nano that I did, I got the magnetised as you would get a regular magnet and I think the nano coating process and each little ping pong ball is going to have different gans inside these are going to be where the water is going to flow through to get energize when it goes to here<br>大卫：是，我想要增加水的等离子体场，让水经过我的自然磁体的等离子体，因为我把甘斯与我做的纳米混合，我就得到磁化的物体，就像一般的磁铁一样，我认为这是纳米材料的处理过程，每一个小的乒乓球里面都有一个不同的甘斯，水流经后这些场后就会得到能量<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can we use this as a blueprint please Renon, Renon are you in the background.<br>凯：我们能够将这个作为蓝图的一部分吗，雷农？雷农，你在线吗？<br>[David]: I already send the idea Renon  about what I am about to prototype that I was just trying to share you know but I need to give in more details of one of the journey that I am going because you know the signal process the Renon is doing with coiling the pipe around the other tube, you know the water pipe I think use the same system and it already feed  with magnetised and I protected the sheet that goes outside and the water goes around freely inside this time this is the ability of the tube within the tube its filled within the fill of the magnetise with the mixture of the gans the water is going to be energize but the field but the old one I am using the coil but I am doing the infinite loop inside the tube<br>大卫：我已经给了雷农一个关于我的想法的雏形，我正在试着分享，但我需要给出更多的我的经历中细节，因为你知道雷农将线圈缠绕在管子上，然后再套在另一个管子上，也就是水管，我用的是同样的系统，它已经被磁化得到能量供给，我保护在外面的薄片，水可以自由的从中经过，但这次，管子中的管子用甘斯的混合物填充进行磁化，水会被场供能，我唯一用线圈是在里面管子里制作无限环<br> I am putting 7 infinite loops and those infinite loops may nano coat the wire it’s going to filled also with the magnet I would gans its going to be a strong field that the water would run in the centre of the unit that irritates the land is going to be charged with the field of this gans you know plus I would say plasma field produced by the gans in the tube it’s going to energize the water  and I am hoping that it your opinions see what you think is that also neutralize the memories what have the chemical you get from the underground,<br>大卫：我把7个无限环放在里面，这些无线环使用纳米线，用甘斯将它们磁化，就会成为一个强大的场，水就从这个单元的中间流过，就能够激活土地，在甘斯的场的作用下土地就像被充电一样，可以说管子里的等离子体场从甘斯从产生，从而给水供能，我希望按照你的观点来说，这也能中和来自地下的化学物质。<br>I am trying to organise by the water just cross the water through this system and the plans we will seen be broadcasted of fertilisers in putting every you know and every coil is been using the same system but the with the health pen you know every coil is been baked with different fertilisers before I put inside this little plastic tube, this one are just samples the ones that are going to be running throught the inside are going to be protected in the plastic tube and I had a hole through the whole of the top of the pipe where I am going to seal it with silicone and but those are gonna be energized with the plasma battery to create the same thing with the health and the helmet its quite the same you know but those are gonna be close to the water pipe but the water is you know going to seal that’s what’s gonna advertise when I am going to develop you know and this is going to be just for my clear irrigation phase<br>大卫：我试图创建这样的结构，让水经过这个系统，到处播种肥料。每一个线圈与医疗笔使用的是同样的系统，每一个线圈是与肥料一起烘烤过的，我把它放入这个塑料管子里，这个只是样本，水经过里面， ，在这个塑料管里是被保护的，我的管子顶部有一个洞，我想要用硅胶密封它，但那些都可以用等离子体电池充能，创造出如何健康装置比如头盔那样的环境，将它密封后就与水管接近，这是我想要宣传与继续发展的装置，这也可以用在我的灌溉的阶段。<br>I will get 2 irrigations today to the week and this is going to be my third type and now I will say this is going to be my third phase where I am going use this prototype to  irrigate the weight and from there I am going to be the most that how I am going to start measuring the bricks the content and how the weight is getting the energy I gonna restarting measuring this way you know trusting some weight into my photography just in my spectrometer to measure the breaks the sugar content that is gonna be you know developing and also I am going to be using this system in my vegetables because I am going to be putting underground I want to bury those and water is going to flow through those areas where the bed store are going to receive the water that’s going to be part of the experiments to part of the vegetables with this journey. Right here the one thing you see the balls they have this piles similar to 90 degreens but this one can be dropped in my water recycle to also energize the water in my rest for, it could be..,<br>大卫：这一周我会进行2次灌溉，这是我的原型设备，我准备在第三阶段使用这个蓝本装置进行灌溉，然后我最可能开始测量间隙，里面的内含物，以及多重，我准备重新开始测量这个，设定标准的重量，用我的光谱仪测量间隙，盐含量，还会不断改善；我还准备将这个系统用在蔬菜上，因为我要把它放在地下，我想要掩埋它，水会流经那个区域，流到地基上，那里面都会接收到水的滋润。这将是这个流程中蔬菜实验的一部分，还有一件事，这些球的放置与呈90度垂直放置的线圈类似，但这一个会浸入到水的再循环中，从而为浇灌田地的水充能，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: If you, we done this experiment those of you who have a reservoir for water for agriculture swimming pool where you see a lot of algae are going in the water we have tested and we have put a small piece of nano copper  in plastic bag and we have hung it in the water for past 3, 4 , 5 months we saw no algae at all before we have to clean then off the wall so if you are using tanks or water reserves small piece we are using 10 by 15 cm if that in the swimming pool and we haven’t seen any algae which is very unusual thought in your water tanks you can put in it too if there are any algae.<br>凯：我们做过这个实验，你们中有人有蓄水池用来蓄水或者用在农业上，或者是游泳池，你会看到在水中有大量的水藻，我做了测试，我们将一小块纳米铜放在塑料袋里，悬挂在水里3,4,5个月，就根本看不到水藻了，但之前我们得清理掉它们。如果你在使用水槽或者蓄水池，一小块，2我们用的是10CM到15CM，用在游泳池里，我们就看不见任何水藻了，这是很不正常的，所以你的水槽里有水藻就可以放一块在里面<br>[David]: Alright, I think I was thinking this is the same as sponges that and I was trying to ask if the water would run through the nano material as you did in the Fukushima experiment were they were to distinct to purify the water, what is the effect if my water runs through the copper things into my field it will kill all the micro flora or the ground or just running through the gutter also change the pH of the water or through the ground through there would that affect the growth of the field in the, hello do you hear me?<br>大卫：我想它与海绵也是一样的作用，水经过纳米材料，就像你在福岛所做的实验，它们用来净化水，如果我的水经过纳米铜再流到我的地里，会有什么影响，它可能会杀死细菌群，或者流过沟槽改变水的PH值，从而会改变田地的产量吗，在吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes<br>凯：是的<br>[David]: Because I was trying to develop different prototypes I want to develop the ones with the copper is not going to be touching the water only the field of the plasma is going to be touching inside where the water flows but I wanted to do some tests would I see if can float with this and nano coated copper pipes too inside to see that could be viewed as pain pad instead of using the like insecticide or anything herbicide to use a copper pipe to scrape also for reputation of some test.<br>大卫：因为我想要发展不同的原型装置，我想要发展一个使用纳米铜大使不直接接触水源的系统，仅仅利用等离子体的场作用于里面的水流，但是我想要做一下测试，看让水流经过纳米铜后是否会起到除草剂或者除虫剂的效果，使用一个纳米铜来喷雾，作为一个测试<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What we suggest with an hour ago with the potatoes in Kenya, we think it is because we tested it and we don’t see parasite maybe it attracts new parasite but what we have seen up to now there is no parasite.<br>凯：我们的建议是，一个小时前我们讨论肯尼亚土豆的实验，因为我们测试了，没有寄生虫，或许会吸引一个新的寄生虫，但目前我们看到的是没有寄生虫<br>[David]: So they do have a type of prototype are going to be developing but plans to spray the plant the ones that I see they are getting sick not every single plant and I won’t spray to all of them I am going to use it as a control device for the plane but my whole idea is to broadcast from this, these are the tasks that you put in the PVC pipes we are putting the spiral here 2 spirals one 90 degree face right there and in each side on each little cup is the test tube that have difference with the different ganses or different fertilisers that I am going to protect to the world. I know I saw the weekend you know from there would be you know feeding the water through all the fertilizers that I would be using in my bones with my gans you know in the different.<br>大卫：所以可以发展出一种只是喷雾的原型装置，我们看见一些作物病了，不是每一个，我想要给所有的作物喷雾，可以将它作为我的一个控制作物环境的装备，但我的整个想法是广泛灌溉与播种，这是任务，放在PVC管子里面，将2个呈90度垂直的螺旋线圈放在这里 ，在里面每个盖帽上都放了一个试管，试管里面是不同的甘斯或者肥料，在周末，我知道，我看见从那里可以给水供能，水通过所有的肥料，我用了骨头以及甘斯，都是不同的<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  But does you plan need this things?<br>凯：你的计划需要这些东西？<br>[David]: Well it need me a lot of naturing because I am not using no fertilisers like everybody is using hear<br>大卫：需要大量的滋养，我没有像这里每个人一样使用化肥<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  yeah but you don’t need to put these things inside or would there field what is created in those coils is efficient enough.<br>凯：是的，但你不需要将这些东西放在里面，或者这些线圈所创造的场的互动就能使作物得到满足？<br>[David]: I don’t know but it would be mentioned that we create this fertilisers from the bones from the different ashes and then looking at a whole other person who hasn’t learned, I can’t do the process of broadcasting due to the same system you know<br>大卫：我不知道，但有一些信息说到，我们可以从这些骨头，纳米，以及不同的灰烬创造出肥料，以及我们学习到相关的过程，我不能用同样的系统进行广泛的播种。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You have a good idea<br>凯：你自己有好主意<br>[David]: The thing that maybe was there I dont need to apply fertilisers<br>大卫：事情是，或许，我不需要使用化肥<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask you a question we are done with the other people who brought us the knowledge, can you we know you came to us in the other teachings. Can you explain to us what’s your background and what you do?<br>凯：我能问你一个问题，我们也对其他带给我们知识的人这样做，我们知道你在其他的教学中也参与进来了。你能向我们介绍一下你的背景吗？<br>[David]: I went to school to be a bio chemist I went  here in Mexico one of the universities and I went Arizona the university to finish my degree in bio chemistry but then I tried to find on the health field and I am purpose and I always say I like to come with the way how to help with varying nutrition and things so this time I decide to go the nutrition part where I would grow organically all the food and then what’s when I start you know working the field, even when I was little I was growing corn it was part of my makeup I used to grow the different things but his time when I saw you first video and started learning you know my master taking and start thinking you about different ways growing and that’s what I dedicate how the research to the food production and to better organic and I tried to create a battery of pure seed you know and I been putting some of the seeds that we lost in my area like corn we lost the seed of the corn through the I would say the manipulation of whatever you know now people that have the seed and I am reproducing the seed in the area that’s part of my experiment too with this and know.<br>大卫：我在学校毕业后成为生物化学家，我最先在墨西哥一个大学上学，然后我去亚利桑那州大学完成了我的生物化学学位，但是然后我转到健康领域，我是有目标与决心的，我喜欢找到方法帮助那些有不同健康状态的人，这一次我决定投入到营养领域——种植有机物，所有的食物，这就是我工作在这个田野的开始，当我还很小的时候，我就在种植玉米，它是我的结构的一部分，我以前场种植不同的东西，这一次当我看见你的视屏教学，开始学习，我的硕士(论文或者实践）就是关于采用不同的方式进行种植，这就是为什么我投身到研究食物的生产方面，从而得到一个更好的有机物，创造更为纯净的种子，我将我们所失去的很多的种子种植在我的区域，比如玉米，我们丢失了玉米的种子；经过了改造，人们得到了现在的种子，我在这个区域重新生产种子，那也是我的实验的一部分。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask you another question? I asked before somehow we got together and answered to it compared to the corn side compared to the past did you have and increase you said you see 2 or 3 or 5 corn what was the harvest more than before and how much or less than before how much.<br>凯：我能问你另一个问题吗？我以前以某种方式问过，我们在一起也回答过，就玉米生产方面来说，与过去相比，你是增加了吗？你说过2个或3个或5个玉米，你在收割的时候比以前是更多吗，多多少，还是比以前减少，减少多少？<br>[David]: well in my experience before I never saw you know corn producing plants so plants so corns or high corns with the variety we go to the back variety we go in this dialect I didn’t see more than 2 you know the plan I saw plants developing<br>大卫：以前我从没见过玉米生产出这个植物，有这么高的玉米，我没有看见超过2个的玉米枝的玉米，这一次是经过我发展的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah but the harvest.<br>凯：是，但这个收成….<br>[David]: Yeah I did this the ones that used with CO2 it produce a lot and I saw the huge corn that came from the application of the gans in the field that I created because I created 2 circles as the energy unit, Magrav unit.<br>大卫：是的，这些玉米我用的是CO2，它生产出很多，在应用甘斯所形成的场中我看见一个巨大的玉米出现，这个甘斯场是我创造的，因为我创造了2个场圈，作为能量单元，磁引力场单元。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Could you give us some ratio compared to the others how much more is it equal or 10% more.<br>凯：相比其他的田，你能给我们一个比例吗？多多少，是相等，还是有超过10%的产量？<br>[David]: no I would say if I compare with my first and second phase that I put I was using different conditions every time my first phase went almost I would say almost double the production on the what I had on my first and 2nd take I saw the corn more strong and more thick but were but I had 7 varieties of corn with the different years I mean different lines I got corn that produced you know like 3rd line of corns you know from 8 to 18 and these were thick corn you know I saw the abruption they was really better than the.<br>大卫：不，如果我比较我的第一和第二阶段，每次我都用的不同的组合造成不同的条件，我的第一阶段几乎是第二阶段产量的2倍，我看见玉米更加强壮与厚实，我生产了谱线上的不同品种的玉米，从8到18的第三线玉米，是比较厚实的玉米，我看见它们的分支确实更好比那些 ….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What about the taste and the texture<br>凯：它的口感与质地怎么样？<br>[David]; Well I did take some pictures when we make tan tamaris and some sweet, sweet things we do with the corn syrup with the amount of the corn with it really good milk candy with them and it was delicious and everybody you almost had to be careful the nobody took all my corn that I grew with the nano materials and everybody enjoy it and everybody really taste or it was really good or don’t have those pictures here you know I have the favour with the this corn with the traditional dishes in Mexico you know the my lettuce with the sweet pudding with the corn not sure what they would call it and it was really good people enjoy you know but let’s say I want to duplicate this time because I have urea seed grown already with nano materials now I want to see effect that I want to have in the full space of growing you know that’s gonna be third space the third time the seed been sown you know in the area and from its gonna be give me better idea of what happens with the seed with the nano material and with the nano materials and not because this land is already been treated with the gans I spray in the land like I say I made a mixture if the 3 gans and I spray it with the big tractor you know and fumigated the land with nano materials especially let’s say the with might be a trick of the wind can prepare with the oversight that they use around the plant I wanted to neutralize the chemical effect and all the people put on the seats,  I could get organic I wanted to neutralize that’s why I wanted your opinion to decontaminate any traces of those chemicals that is I spray the whole gans to see if I could cause a neutralizing effect on the seed before.<br>大卫：这个口感，我拍过几张图片，用玉米浆制作的甜食，很不错，牛奶糖果味，美味，每个人都，你要很小心别让人拿你的玉米，因为我都用上纳米材料，每人都很享受，尝起来很美味。在这里没有那些图片，在墨西哥用这些玉米做成传统菜肴，比如用玉米做的甜布丁，他们这么叫，很不错，人们都很享受；但这一次我想要重复，因为我有用纳米材料处理的尿素种子，这些种子已经生长了，现在我想要看看结果如何，我想要进行全面的种植，那将是第三阶段，在这个区域第三次种子会被下种，到那时我会根据种子情况想出更好的主意，如何更好运用纳米材料与甘斯，因为这片土地已经用过甘斯，我在这个土地上用甘斯喷洒，我用了3种甘斯的混合物，我用一个大型拖拉机喷洒，已经用纳米材料熏蒸这个土地，人们将化学剂用在作物身上，我想要中和人们施加在种子上的化学影响，我能得到有机性，我想要进行中和，这就是我为什么想要得到你的意见如何去除这些化学剂的影响，我喷洒了全部的甘斯，来看看是否我可以对种子进行中和的处理<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Rick can you go on to the message and you got Ben Lato Bekara can you take this gentleman off the chat please. The go to the other side<br>凯：瑞克，你能看下这个信息吗，找到Ben Lato Bekara这个人，你能在聊天室里把这位绅士弄走吗？然后去另一边<br>[Rick]: Sure Mr. Keshe<br>瑞克：好，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: He is making a all of nonsense comments in the background<br>凯：他在聊天室进行一些胡说八道的评论<br>[Rick]: Yes I know I just warned him about that<br>瑞克：是的，我刚警告过他<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes take him out ban him from all the chat rooms and zoom please.<br>凯：恩，将他移出所有的聊天室以及视屏室<br>[Rick]: Okay<br>瑞克：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Carry on please<br>凯：请继续<br>[David]: Like the production that is going to be coming this year with the land being already prepared with the gans I want to start the application of the nano materials the you know the different metals that I want to be spraying that I did before in the diffrent palnt where I group biomass of different plant where they put the biomass of the shoes they put almost 3 times bigger as the first cycle you know.<br>大卫：今年我已经准备将甘斯用在这个土地上，我想要开始运用不同的甘斯材料，不同的金属材料，我想要喷涂，我以前在不同的植物上运用过，相比第一周期，长的有3倍大<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I remember  you telling us that last time.<br>凯：我记得你上次告诉过我们<br>[David]: Yes I got to repeat the same thing now this here and I will know do a comparison with the ones here our way got it almost short of the chilli peppers and I am putting against the little ring as we did before we start the roles, the CO2 rings the little hoses with the gans are going to do the same receipts again then start you know recording in for this time you know that you will have<br>大卫：是的，我在今年要重复一遍，我想要与去年做一个比较，我们有一些短的辣椒，我将CO2甘斯环放在上面，装有甘斯的软管，进行重复的过程，从而在今年记录下来<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much, is this all you can share with us because we have other people waiting in the background<br>凯：很感谢，这就是所有你想要与我们分享的吗，因为我们还有其他人等着要分享<br>[David]: This time they will be an update that I want to be keeping an update in the<br>大卫：这一次会进行一次更新，我想要进行一次更新<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think what we got to do I have setup an agriculture at keshefoundation agriculture.keshefoundation.org and I have set up a chat room in the background for the agriculture team I need to open a section for agriculture is to record the testimonials so if you into the Keshe foundation and agriculture.keshefoundation.org we will setup a system that people can put only agricultural testimonies in there, like we do with the other side. Okay if people can put in that the others can benefit by it than how we can do it. Carry on please<br>凯：我认为我们要在凯史基金会设立一个关于农业的网站agriculture.keshefoundation.org，我们已经在后台为农业团队设立了一个聊天室，我们还需要为农业设立一个版块，用来记录农业方面的测试，所以如果你去凯史基金会agriculture.keshefoundation.org，我们会建立一个系统让人们能够上传农业的测试报告，就像基金会的其他领域一样。如果人们将自己的测试报告放上去，其他人就会从中受益，这是我们如何做的。请继续。<br>[David]: Soon as I get my process working I plan to renovate they want to have the blueprint  drained I will be a prototype that I am going to be using for energizing the water you know<br>大卫：很快，当我进行我的工作程序，我想要做蓝图里的原型机，用来给水供能<br>[Mr. Keshe]: If you send it as it is because I have seen some beautiful designs from you and we let the others parallel use them when you change it you add to it let us know and we gets added to the blue print by Renon in the background.<br>凯：如果你做好了传给我们，因为我已经看到你做了很多不错的设计，我们可以让其他人学习并使用，当你做了改进，增添了新的内容，就通知我们，我们可以让雷农添加到蓝图里<br>[David]: okay sir PDF details of the measurement of everything you know and it can be available everybody<br>大卫：好的，先生，关于每件事情的测试细节会做成PDF格式，每个人都可以看到并学习<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much thank you for sharing your knowledge with us and you been with us for some time I am sure we will come back to sharing knowledge and if you can join our agriculture group because, I think you teaching as part of the teaching group  am I correct<br>凯：很感谢，感谢你与我们分享知识，你已经和我们在一起一段时间了，我肯定我们会再次回来分享知识，如果你能加入到我们的农业团队，我认为你的教学可以作为教学团队的一部分，对吗？<br>[David]: Well the they will ask me to star doing the teaching on that part of it with the near I will start teaching if you want to teach I am ready I can teach whatever I am learning here and whatever I can you know experience in the agriculture. I want know how things can work but I will be open to teach and I gonna be already and the group it’s going to be here it will be working with me I am going to start teaching the classes here.<br>大卫：他们想让我在那部分进行教学，我会准备好，我在这里学习农业方面的知识，有这方面的经验，我想要知道事情运作的原理，我也可以公开进行教学，我已经准备，团队将会在这里与我一起工作，我准备进行教学<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much indeed we try to put the agriculture in the coming time as we growing there are sectors like the health doctors can come and teach each other and we do agriculture so we have created the space ship we have created the agriculture nothing we need to have agriculture is part of the teaching and it’s on, it’s on the health, Thank you very much for being with us and sharing you knowledge I enjoy watching you very much I enjoy watching you last time. Thank you for your time. Who do we have next Rick? Hello<br>凯：很感谢你，我们在将来会将农业如同医疗一样设置在基金会网站上，博士们可以过来相互教学，我们做农业方面的事情，所以我们创造了宇宙飞船，我们创造了农业，我们将农业作为教学的一部分，如何医疗一样，很感谢你参与到我们中来，与我们一起分享知识，我们很享受与你的分享过程，上一次我就与你分享的很愉快，谢谢你的时间，瑞克，谁是下一个？<br>[Rick]: Hi Mr. Keshe. Well we have a couple of other things and there was a Miguel that is on here and I thinks it’s the same Miguel that Vaktang from Australia was speaking of visited him and he wanted to be on the workshop. Miguel is it the same Miguel I will unmute you.<br>瑞克：在，凯史先生，我们有几个其他的事情，在这里有一个叫米格尔的人，我认为他是澳大利亚的瓦克唐邀请过来的那个米格尔，他想要在这个直播上面来，米格尔是那个米格尔吗，我给你静音。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What is it what does he want to show is it to do with the agriculture.<br>凯：他想要展示什么，是与农业相关的吗？<br>[Miguel]: Can you hear me?<br>米：你们能听见吗？<br>[Rick]: Let’s find out from him, himself.<br>瑞克：让我找出他<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  carry on<br>凯：继续<br>[Rick]: go ahead Mr. Keshe<br>瑞：凯史先生，请继续<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What are you going to show us Miguel please<br>凯：你想要向我们展示什么，米格尔<br>[Miguel]: I want to show you a cube Mr. Keshe can you hear<br>米：我想要向你展示立方体，凯史先生，你能够听见吗<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes what is the cube?<br>凯：是的，什么立方体？<br>[Miguel]: hold on a second let me<br>米：稍等，让我…<br>[Rick]: What topic do you want discuss<br>瑞：你要讨论什么样的主题？<br>[Miguel]: the topic I am wondering if we can use the cube for instruct a deal and decrease the earthquake effects.<br>米：主题是我想要知道是否我们可以使用这个立方体来构建一种能量从而减轻地震的影响<br>[Mr. Keshe]: That I don’t know we got so see the cube today it’s a agriculture<br>凯：我不知道，我们要看一下，今天是关于农业的教学<br>[Miguel]: Okay<br>米：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay thank you very much come back on Tuesday and we will look<br>凯：好，在星期二回来，我们再来一起讨论<br>[Miguel]: Okay<br>米：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thank you very much Can we go to Renon, Renon what do you have to show us on your agriculture side and you mention it in the innovation centre<br>凯：很感谢，我们能连上雷农吗，雷农，在创新中心，关于农业方面你想要向我们展示什么，<br>[Renon]: Yes sir<br>雷：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Hello<br>凯：在吗？<br>[Renon]; Hello sir yes I had a feedback a while ago so I need to off the other computer<br>雷：是的，我有一些信号反馈，所以我要关一下其他电脑<br>[Mr. Keshe]: no problem<br>凯：没问题<br>[Renon]: I would like to, Douglas would like to present his work I will be sharing the screen and I think Douglas is online.<br>雷：道格拉斯想要展示一些什么，他将分享屏幕，我认为他在线<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Douglas is part of the United States innovation group of the Keshe foundation I presume?<br>凯：你指的道格拉斯是美国凯史基金会创新团队的，是吗<br>[Renon]: Yes sir that’s Douglas<br>雷：是的，是那个道格拉斯<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Douglas okay<br>凯：好的<br>[Rick]: yes I will get hold of him now.<br>瑞克：是，我连上他了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Renon yo have some of the work of the participants if you can make them into a blueprint and post them into a blueprint section agricultural blueprint please.<br>凯：雷农，有一些参与者的工作很有价值，如果你能把这些加入到蓝图中去，将它们放到农业蓝图部分上<br>[Renon]: Yes sir I will prefer that all of them as well that it will be ready for posting we will just collect all the information so will share screen for Douglas presentation, are you up Douglas?<br>雷农：是的，先生，我会优先处理的，已经准备好上传了，我们会收集所有的信息，现在让道格拉斯分享屏幕，你在吗，道格拉斯<br>[Douglas]: yes sir<br>道：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Hello how are you  hello<br>凯：你好<br>[Douglas]: yes sir<br>道：在<br>[Rick]: I think he is ready<br>瑞：我认为他准备好了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We are waiting for you to enlighten us.<br>凯：我们正在等你启发教导我们<br>[Douglas]: I have a blank screen is he sharing my screen<br>道：我这里是黑屏，他分享了我的屏幕吗<br>[Renon]: we are still waiting for Renon to share your screen<br>雷：我们还在等雷农分享你的屏幕<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  I am going to stand up and you carry on<br>凯：我会一直等待，你继续<br>[Rick] There you go<br>瑞克：好了<br>[Renon]: Okay Douglas you can start<br>雷：好的，道格拉斯，你可以开始了<br>[Douglas]: Okay these plasma devices that are used are nano coated metal tubes water energizing tubes and plasm water energizing using CO2 gans using a copper nano coated tube and using a copper coated nano coated coil with CO2 gans. These plasma devices are used to energize water and also raise alkalinity in water for agriculture uses the nano coated metal tubes the water energizing tubes is what we refer them to have a coupled together with the zinc tube and PVC coupling of copper nano coated piece of actually there are several pieces inside the tube here and then and iron tube and then another plastic fitting on the end here that connects to the in line of agricultural system to decontaminate waterways and pH level and also filter I have found out. This is a the tube that you just seen the schematic that I have created out of parts some new some I had laying around house the half-inch copper and brass in the brass holding half-inch brass hard pipe to mangle with black iron and inch and a quarter galvanized water line of we don’t use these in the United States for water except in a places for farm use we don’t use it for proper drinking water anymore but inside this tube will see a underneath it there is a several series of coil nano coated copper 26mm and their 13 inches long and they are 4 of them ranging in sizes from 3 As all the way up to 1 inch in diameter and I used dial rod to wrap these around in a counter clockwise direction and are inside of each other and they fit inside of the galvanized too<br> ，<br>道：好的，这些等离子体设备是经过纳米涂层的金属管，给水提供能量的管子，等离子体态给水供能的管子，使用CO2甘斯，使用纳米涂层铜管，使用纳米涂层铜线圈和CO2甘斯， ,这些等离子体设备用来给水供能，同时提高水的碱性，应用在农业方面，这个纳米金属铜管，给水供能的管子，我们所指的是一种组合连接，带有锌管，PVC，铜，纳米涂层部分，事实上几块金属都是管子里面，然后是铁管，然后是塑料接合在末端，这个将这个设备连接到农业系统中，可以净化水以及改变PH值，我们发现还可以过滤。 ，这个是管子，刚才看的是示意图，我制作出了其中一些部分，一些是新的，我放在房间里，半英寸的铜，我们用的是半英寸的黄铜，然后与黑色的铁连接，铁是有四分之一镀锌，在美国我们不把这个用在水上，除了用在一些地方的农场上，我们不再将它用在饮用水上，但在管子里面， 我们看见有几个串联的线圈，纳米铜，26MM宽，13英寸长，有4种，大小不等，直径从3到1英寸，我用拨杆将它们呈逆时针缠绕，在里面它们相互接合，也是镀锌的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do we have a blueprint of this please<br>凯：我们能够将这个做成蓝图吗？<br>[Douglas]: Yes<br>道：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No the tube winding you show us you said you nano winded it you winded anticlockwise<br>凯：不，你展示给我们看的管子，你说的纳米缠绕，逆时针缠绕的<br>[Douglas]: Right here I didn’t actually draw a blue print of this we can make on real quick.<br>道：这里，我们事实上没有画这个的蓝图，我们可以尽快画一个<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It has to be done because people can see what they have<br>凯：必须要完成，这样人们能够看见是什么<br>[Douglas]: Yes sir no problem. I found when I put this inside the filtration box it was used as a nano coating energizer is what it was used for to energize and supply nutrients for a plant growth what I found in the process of using this as it also works as a filter it collects things sediments and tracks it like a ionizer that the way I could describe it,<br>道：好，没问题，先生。我发现我把它放在过滤箱里，它以前是用作一个纳米涂层的增能器，它被用作给植物生产提供能量以及供应营养，我发现的是在使用的过程中，它起到过滤的作用，能够创造沉积物，它的运作就像离子发生器，我可以这样描述<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what does, does the water touch the material direct?<br>凯：这个水直接接触了这个材料吗？<br>[Douglas]: On this one yes<br>道：这个是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  It cannot do that because<br>凯：不能那样做，因为<br>[Douglas]: It goes through another filtration stage<br>道：它又经过另一个过滤的阶段<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Oh, okay will but we cannot risk part of the work anything we consume at the end cannot be directly in touch with nano material<br>凯：哦，好。我们不能冒那个险，我们在末端饮用的任何东西都不能直接接触到纳米材料<br>[Douglas]: This is at the beginning sir of the filtration system<br>道：这只是这个过滤系统的第一步<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay no problem carry on.<br>凯：好，没问题，继续<br>[Douglas]: this is the beginning of the system<br>道：这只是这个系统的开始<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah carry on<br>凯：好，继续<br>[Douglas]: the water comes in over here on right side of the page if we could go back to that last page sir to clarify some things for some people, the water comes in on the right side of the page over here<br>道：水从右边进来，如果我回到上一个页面，为一些人清楚的解释一下，水从这个右边进来<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  Slow down, lets so down. It’s not just to show we got to learn in a nice way you are showing beautiful this just take your time.<br>凯：放慢一些。放慢一些，我们都要学习，这不只是展示，我们需要以一种好的方式学习，你展示的很美妙，慢慢来<br>[Douglas]: yes sir I am just nervous<br>道：是的，先生，我只是有点紧张<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I know that’s why I am telling you to slow down<br>凯：我知道，这就是为什么我叫你慢慢来<br>[Douglas]: On the right side of the page you will see a half inch copper hard pipe and this is the inlet sight of the water it comes from the reservoir tank in the bottom it comes up and goes through the brass through the black iron through what I call the filtration and nano coated filtration device and then outside and down the vinyl tubing and now we can go to the next stage down to yes with the blue print of the coil and then there is the, now this is the coil that Mr. Keshe said that by its own is nano coated caustic coated and fire coated and caustic stream coated, the copper on the inside is a quarter inch copper tubing that’s been caustic coated and steam coated and fire coated and the vinyl tubing has been caustic coated on the inside the vinyl tubing holds the CO2 gans and the water goes to the copper tubing on the inside that does not have gans or anything on the inside of the copper tubing.<br>道：在右边你看到半英寸的铜管 ，是水从底部的储水箱进来的入口，水上来经过黄铜 ，经过黑色的铁，再经过过滤管，经过外面有纳米涂层的过滤设备 ，然后经过乙烯管 ；现在我们来到下一页， ，这是蓝图中的线圈 ，这是经过烧碱涂层，火涂层，纳米蒸汽涂层，里面的铜是四分之一英寸铜管，它是经过烧碱涂层，烧碱蒸汽涂层以及火涂层的，里面的乙烯管是经过烧碱涂层的，乙烯管上面有CO2甘斯，水经过里面的铜管，在里面的铜管里面没有没有甘斯或者其他什么东西<br>[Renon]: And I will just like to add there is a additional that can be positive if you don’t have any coper tubing you can use your coils instead of wrapping so you can use coils to wrap around in case you don’t have copper tubing available but you have wires so you can also try it.<br>雷农：另外我想要说一点， ，如果你没有任何铜管，你可以使用线圈包裹缠绕， ，如果你没有铜管。你可以使用线圈<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  That’s fantastic, but how do you get  the coils inside the pipe.<br>凯：很美妙，但是你如何将线圈放入管子里面<br>[Douglas]: Well on my instance you know Mr. Keshe as far as the tubing I had to have help with my daughters and they lay stretched out  the vinyl tubing because that’s the hardest part because it likes ot roll back up on you and while inserted the copper tubing inside the vinyl tubing so I had to have help with my daughters.<br>道：我做这个管子的话，凯史先生，我需要我的女儿们的帮助，她们拉伸这个乙烯管子，因为这是最难的部分，因为它会卷回到你那里，当这个铜管插入这个乙烯管中，我得需要我的女儿的帮助<br>[Renon]: They were 3 people working on this system this one is almost, this is 0.75m long and it took 10m of coils to just wrap around the hose inside and we wrap to around with another transparent hose to protect the coils and this can, we can put CO2 gans inside the transparent hose so the hose inside will only receive the energy of the coil and the gans so there will be no contamination from the materials<br>雷农：是，需要有3个人做这个系统，这是大概0.75米，需要10米的线圈缠绕这个里面的管子 ，在外面用了另一个透明的管子用来包裹保护线圈，我们可以把CO2甘斯放在这个透明的软管里面，管子里面将会只接受线圈与甘斯的能量，没有来自其他物质的污染<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  Thank you very much can you.<br>凯：很感谢<br>[Renon]: so let’s continue with the experiment of Douglas with the using those devices on above.<br>雷：让我们继续道格拉斯使用这些设备的实验<br>[Douglas]: Yes sir the first thing that I noticed when I done my experiment was I done 15 minute interval test on the first hour I was using regular tap water in the reservoir and then reservoir my tap water registered a pH of 7.2 and undissolved solids of parts per million of 223 within 15 minutes my pH had dropped down had went up to 7.6 my parts per million had dropped to 5 within another 15 minutes my parts per million went up to 7 the pH 7.3. The next 15 minutes interval the pH jumped to 7.5 and ppm stayed at 7 and the last 15 minute interval which would be a hour later my pH jumped to 7.5 and ppm at 9 25 hours later the pH had risen to 7.6 and with undissolved solids at 26 and 13ppm confirming that the pH and all the undissolved solids and parts per million were being a increased by the effects of the nano coated structure.<br>道：好，首先我注意到，我做我的实验的时候，是在一个小时中每隔15分钟进行测试，我用的是来自水库中平常的自来水，水库里面出来的自来水的PH值是7.2，未溶解固体是百万分之223，在15分钟内，当PH值升到7.6，然后就下降了，未溶解固体降到5，在另一个15分钟内，我的未溶解固体升到7，PH是7.3， ；在下一个15分钟，PH达到7.5，未溶解固体量保持在7，在最后15分钟，PH升到7.5，未溶解固体量达到9；在25小时后，PH值达到7.6，未溶解固体量在26小时后是每百万分之13，确认结果是：PH值与未溶解固体量在纳米结构的影响下在上升。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What is that melon doing in your drawing we missed what was that melon on the top?<br>凯：你的展示中有甜瓜，是指的什么，在上面的页面中<br>[Douglas]: That’s just the picture of a cantaloupe that’s one of the controlled experiment that we are using to picture as a reference so people know what season the plants that we are fixing to show that we are going.<br>道：是一个哈密瓜的图片，它是对照实验之一，我们用这个图片作为参照，这样人们就会知道我们在展示什么季节的植物<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You are you using those seeds?<br>凯：你在使用那些种子吗？<br>[Douglas]: I am using organically grown seed that I grew here on my yard in 2013<br>道：我在使用有机生长的种子，2013年，我种在我的院子里<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay with those melons inside these are the seed you collected<br>凯：好，这些是在甜瓜里收集的种子<br>[Douglas]: Yes well not those ones particular melon but on similar to<br>道：是的，不是那种特别的甜瓜，但类似<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It was very appetising<br>凯：看起来很开胃<br>[Douglas]; Hard to keep those with 3 daughters<br>道：有3个女儿，这些很难一直保存，呵呵<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah carry on.<br>凯：是的，继续<br>[Douglas]: As a control experiment ordinary growing and reverse osmosis form and specimen B was in CO2 and soil and 4 seed at first and I transplanted 2 of the specimens and once specimen into 2 different apparatuses specimen which specimen C was a drift feed with nano coated tap water filtration device specimen D is a aeroponics high pressure mist bucket with CO2<br>道：作为对照试验，是一般的生长，是一种反渗透形式；样本B是将CO2甘斯用在土壤里，最先是4个种子，移植了2个种子到样本C，1个种子到样本D；样本C是将经过纳米铜过滤处理的自来水滴灌的，样本D是气培法，一种有CO2甘斯的高压的雾桶<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Slow down, slow down you are going to fast<br>凯：慢一点，慢一点，你太快了<br>[Douglas]: I am sorry Mr. Keshe, yes specimen C is a drip feed which is a continuous drip feed of the structure we see earlier which we will see more off here in a minute with the nano coated copper arrow which is reverse osmosis tap water filtration device. Thea water comes out of my R.O. filter and right around 7.0 to 7.03 depending and specimen D is a Aeropronics high pressure mist bucket system with CO2 gans only in it and 2 gallons and I have the mixture of the CO2 gans at 20ml of CO2 gans per 2 gallons of R.O water which is some really clean water and I have phenomenal results from the high pressure bucket as we will see here shortly. Phenomenal growth. These are the seed that I had put in CO2 gans water and tap water and during<br>道：抱歉，凯史先生，样本C是经过持续的滴灌的，就是我们之前看到的那个结构，很快我们会看到更多关于这个纳米铜反渗透自来水过滤装置，水从我的反渗透过滤装置出来，PH值在7.0到7.03之间，不一定；样本D是用的高压气培法—雾桶系统，只用CO2甘斯，以及2加仑水，将20ML的CO2甘斯融入2加仑反渗透水中，反渗透水也就是很干净的水，我有来自高压桶的结果，我们很快会看到用这个方法产生的结果， 。这是我分别将种子放在CO2甘斯水以及自来水中 。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: How long did you put them in there?<br>凯：你在里面放了多长时间？<br>[Douglas]: The CO2 seeds germinated faster about 3 days that are the R.O water actually those dates are from the my first experiment and we had and emergency and something happened so I restarted the experiment on the 10th with regeneration on the 10th of January and on the 16 of January I planted the in the soil which you will see here shortly because Renon has already update the file. So the CO2 gans went there in the soil, I put them both in the soil in the same day and this is day 10 from germination and you can see on the right the CO2 gans and the soil and you can see on the left the different comparisons now these are both under a 18 Watt fluorescent bright white light minimum wattage, the CO2 gans and the soil I have noticed throughout the testing procedure that in all my data confirms that the CO2 holds the special property that allows moisture to be retained in the soil whereas the regular R.O water on the left here I have to water every other day the CO2 gans I only have to water once a week.<br>道：用CO2浸泡的种子发芽快些，浸泡了大约3天，用的是反渗透水，上面的日期是从我第一次开始试验算起，我们有一些紧急的事情，有一些其他事情发生了，我在1月10号重新开始了试验，在1月16号我把种子种植在土地里，你可以很快看到，因为雷农已经更新了文件，所以我将CO2甘斯放在土地里，我在同一天将它们放在土壤里， 这是10天发芽，你们能看见在右边是在土壤里用的CO2甘斯，左边作为一个不同的比较，它们都是用的18瓦日光灯，亮白灯的最小功率， ，我注意到用了CO2甘斯的土壤在整个测试过程中，我的所有数据都支持这样的结论：CO2甘斯拥有一种特殊的性能，能够保留住土壤里的潮湿，然而在左边用的平常的反渗透水，我不得不隔一天就浇灌一次，使用CO2甘斯的这边的土壤，我一周只需要浇灌一次<br>[Mr. Keshe]: This is line with what we saw with the test in Kenya it gets faster so you don’t use that much and this we have seen from long time this is why we said these seeds are perfect for Africa places like ours where there are very short summers with very little rain these seeds are perfect it answers the hunger we know this for long time now are showing us clearly the application.<br>凯：这与我们在肯尼亚的测试是相符合的，你做的比较快，所以你没用那么多，我们很早以前就看到过。这就是为什么我说这些种子对于非洲是很合适的，他们那里一些地方有很短的夏季，有很少的雨，这些种子是很完美的，能够解决饥饿问题，我很久以前就知道了，现在已经向我们清晰的展示了应用的前景<br>[Douglas]: If you notice the uniform equal growth I like ot use a word  Mr. Keshe uses is correct in the CO2 gans on the right all the plants are of equal height equal growth and they all look terrific and you will see the ones on the left in the R.O condition that one looks they have all got some kind of little deformity to them it would appear they are not growing equally and they are not healthy and vibrant looking<br>道：如果你注意到一种均衡的长势，我喜欢一个词，凯史先生所使用的是正确的，在右边运用CO2甘斯的植物长的同样高，同样的长势，它们看起来都极好，你看见在左边的用反渗透水的环境下，长势存在有某种畸形，相互之间长的不平衡，也不健康，外表没有什么朝气<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you tell us what R.O water can you explain to us<br>凯：你能向我们解释一下R.O水是什么吗？<br>[Douglas]: Yes sir that is reverse osmosis, what that is it’s a water filtration device system that is setup in a household residential application and can commercial too but mine is set up for residential and its 7 stage filtration system that takes out 99.9% of all undissolved solid ppm and then chlorine contaminants and will talk about just about anything out except nuclear material<br>道：是的，先生。那是一种反渗透，是一种水过滤系统，用在家居住宅中，也可以商用，而我的所设置的是住宅的，是7个阶段的过滤系统，能够过滤掉99.9%的未溶解固体以及氯污染物，几乎可以过滤掉除了原子核外所有的东西<br>[Mr. Keshe]: That’s is what you are feeding the poor chap that’s why it’s so deformed<br>凯：所以你是在用这个水供给这个可怜的家伙，这就是为什么它长得这样畸形<br>[Douglas]: Yes exactly<br>道：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  You got to give him a normal water you starting him tis go nothing to live on I would have been very very careful with this because you have to use the normal water not the water which is cleaned out in the nature we don’t have a clean out water so carry on please.<br>凯：你要给它普通的水，你在使它们饥饿，它们没有什么赖以生存，我会对此很小心，你要用正常的水，而不是过滤的水，在自然中我们没有净化的水，所以请继续<br>[Douglas]: The usual in the first stages of plant growth we find and there is nothing  nutrients in the soil it’s all for the plant to get through the first stages of life without any nutrients at all so being the case there you can see that there is big difference in the CO2 compared to the R.O. This is the initial setup that I had started before I moved to the bigger room and as you can see the water filtration device in the back corner there going around the pump pumps it through and it goes back into a continuous feed and into a water fall creating aeration so there is no need for an air put its supplying oxygen into the water, the continuous drip feed it going to the seed bucketed the one listed as C and the D bucket is another control plant and the A bucket is another R.O plant the R.O water plant that I had just sitting up there under the light while I was building another room this was a temporary setup so I could keep everything running according to that way  we were working the schedule till I could get the room built.<br>道：通常植物生长的第一阶段，我们发现在土壤里没有什么营养元素，这是植物要度过的在没有任何营养素的情况下属于最弱的第一阶段，这种情况下，你可以看到在CO2甘斯样本与R.O. 样本之间的巨大区别，在搬到更大的房间之前，这是我最初的设置，你可以看到这个过滤水装置，在后面角落围绕周边的泵，泵穿过去然后回到这边提供一个持续的水供给 ，形成一个瀑布似的流水，从而创造一个增氧的环境，所以不需要有一个空气泵，这个装置将氧气持续的输送到水中（04:10:10），对C桶是进行持续的滴灌，D桶是另一种对照植物，A桶是用过滤水进行浇灌的植物，我把它就设置在那里，同时我在建立另一个实验房间，这是暂时像这样设置，这样我就可以使所有事物按照我们工作计划进行，直到我把房间建设好。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  Carry on please<br>凯：请继续<br>[Douglas]: This is after the plant were separated and I left the one in the CO2 gans soil and these are the ones in the R.O soil here the ones that were 4 in each one when we started and the 4 get separated from the soil and eh 4 get separated from the CO2 gans one was left in the soil 2 were left into a drip stage and one was put into the aeroprine mist bucket. With Co2 gans these are the first like I said these are the first pictures of the initial drip stage that I just rigged up temporarily until we could get the other one built. And this shows the plant being fed and this shows he growth at day 24 and you can see the soils, this is really good soil this is potting soil that I got for my wife’s flower bed around her roses but she doesn’t know that though and over on the right we have the Co2 gans and as we could see the soils is not new as good as the one around the CO2 gans I just grabbed some soil out of the yeah and the plant is 3 times the size of the other ones and there is still no uniform growth on the R.O water plant.<br>道：这是分开的可以相互比较的实验组 ，我让一个是有CO2甘斯的土壤，这边是R.O 高纯水土壤，我们开始做了4组，第4组是与土壤分离，与CO2甘斯分离；第一组是放在土壤里，第二组是滴灌，还有一组是用了CO2甘斯进行气培法。这一个是最初的进行滴灌的图片，我草草做成的，直到另一个实验房间做好 。这显示植物被供养。这个显示植物生长了24天， ，你看这些土壤，真的是很好的土壤，是盆栽土壤，我将它用来给我的妻子的玫瑰花床培土，尽管她不知道。在右边我们用了CO2甘斯，你可以看见经过CO2甘斯栽培的土壤看起来不新鲜，我抓了一些土壤出去，这里的植物是旁边的三倍大，用R.O水栽培的植物还是没有呈现一致的生长状态。<br>This is the high pressure aeropronics mist bucket there are a series of high pressure jets with a pump inside of a bucket with a another bucket with hydrogen clay pellets these are neutral they won’t hold nutrients and they don’t have nutrients and they don’t supply nutrients they are just a medium for growing in to show people that we can grow plants in any condition whether it would be and rock clay whatever using the CO2 gans the gallons has only 2 gallons of reverse osmosis water which is 7.0 with 5ppm with 20ml of CO2 gans added to the water this is sent in interval of every 4 hours it click on every 4 hours by timing system and waters the plant at 15 minute intervals every 4 hours  4 times a day every 6 hours sorry. This is another update picture put on the right side after I had just transplanted the plant so it was going through transplant shock for a few days and I think there is about 3 or 4 day to settle out and on the left we have the drip feed still in its temporary positon or I got a visitor on that one looks like fly was visiting us and you can see the 2 drip feed plant are really taking off to the new environment and they are really loving the energize water that are receiving from the nano structure, here is another picture comparing the R.O plant to the CO2 gans plant as you can see the notable difference on the size to the CO2 on the right compared to the R.O on the left and this is at day 30.<br>道：这是用的高压气培雾桶法，从泵里面出来一系列高压的喷射流进入到桶里， ，用一个带氢的有黏土颗粒的桶，这些是中性的，不会保留营养物，没有营养素，不提供营养素，这只是一个展示生长的媒介，向人们表明使用CO2甘斯种子可以在任何环境中生长，无论是岩石黏土或者什么，这里用的是2加仑反渗透水，PH值是7.0，将20ML的甘斯加入到水中，装置时间间隔设置为每4小时供给一次，供水是一天4次，每6小时供给一次。这是另一个更新的图片，右边是我刚进行移植的 ，它在几天之内就克服了移植休克，我认为是花了3到4天稳定下来，左边的是进行滴灌，还是在一个暂时的位置上，那上面是一个苍蝇。你可以看到这个滴灌的实验组像是完全进入到一个新环境中，它们似乎很喜欢这个由纳米材料处理的得到能量的水。这是另一个图片 ，高纯反渗透水种植与CO2甘斯种植的比较，你们可以看见它们之间在大小上很明显的差别。这是30天。<br>This is also at day 30 and for the first time in my life and I have been farming most of my life and growing cantaloupes for a long time I have flowers on cantaloupe plants in 30days and this is a first for me and this in the nano coated copper structures the only continuous drip feed and the aeropronic bucket on the right here you can see it’s a slight discolouration this is still going through transplant shock. Here we see the cantaloupe plants again here at day 33 and once again the CO2 gans and once aging the root structure underneath is just really taking off the lower leaves are really starting to deplete the energy sources for them and drought which is a normal reaction and plant growth and on the left we see the R.O plant are vibrant and green but still lacking in growth structure and the root structure the CO2 gans plant. On day 33 we notice that on aeropronic mist bucket that the plant has finally overcome its transitional shock period from transplanting and we look over on the drip feed nano coating bucket and we see that just a couple of days  later that these plants have almost tripled in size and we have flowers coming of 3 nodes.<br>道：这个也是30天， 这是在我的生命中第一次，我从事农业大半辈子，种植哈密瓜很长一段时间，在30天内哈密瓜开花了，这是我的生命中第一次看到，这是用纳米铜结构进行滴灌的，在右边气培法栽培的有轻微的变色，它还是在克服移植休克。这是哈密瓜第33天的情况 ，再一次，你们看到CO2甘斯，在下面根部的结构真的已经耗尽了，低垂的叶子表明已经耗竭了能量资源，显出枯竭的态势，这是植物生长中正常的反应，在左边用高纯反渗透水使用的哈密瓜显得生机勃勃，是鲜绿色，但是仍然缺乏使用CO2甘斯的哈密瓜所拥有的根部结构与生长结构。在33天，我们注意到使用气培雾桶法栽培的哈密瓜植物终于克服了移植休克期， ，我仔细观察了这个通过纳米结构滴灌供养的哈密瓜植物，只是几天后，这些植物已经长得有3倍大了，并从3个节点开出花来。<br>I was very excited to see my flowers. Here is a close picture of flowering and this is close up picture and like a said very excited about the flowering this is first for me I had a tallness in my heart for agriculture been involved with it for over 30 years and so this was, this kind of make me jump up and down I was pretty excited about this because opens up all kinds of new doors for the world. Now here is then egg system that I had been working on in my building getting it built and getting it setup properly so we could have a proper demonstration it took me a while to it as I am by myself and as you can see in the first picture on the right here on the top right corner you get the bucket and the control plants and the continuous drip feed system all set up an going with the water filtration device at the top left corner there and you can see that the water comes up through the green tube and it goes into the copper  and it goes through the structure and it comes back down and it comes back up and comes through there the where rain is going in this corner through the copper coated CO2 gans filled energizing water tube and that feed the plant as you can see its connect to a smaller about a reduction of fittings is connected to a smaller tube that is connected to a nano foiled tube there on the tray that feed each plant individually continuous amount they all each receive the same amount of water and as do not put any filtration devices that we buy from a store such as charcoal or anything like that I made my filters so somebody couldn’t say well he put something in there that’s done this.so I used just a quarter inch fish net filter as you can see where the reservoir drain back down from the tank and the water goers to the net there is 13 inches od fall from the drain line to the reservoir tank so there more than enough adequate aeration there is no need for an air device to air in the water this screen works really well as I have seen it picks up minute contaminates that gets through and don’t get caught in this catechism and ain’t yet about every 3 for 3 or 4 days for any debris that gets in here.<br>道：看见我的花我感到十分兴奋，这个是花朵的近照 ，这是第34天，我说过看见这些花我很兴奋，这对于我来说是第一次，我全身心投入到农业有30年了，这让我兴高采烈，手舞足蹈，因为这打开了这个世界很多扇新领域的门。这是孵育系统， ，我一直在我的楼房里工作，构建它，正确的设置它，这样才能有一个正确的展示，这是我一个人做的，你们能够看见第一张图右边顶部，右边角落里，是控制对照组，持续的滴灌系统被设置在上方左角的过滤水装置，你可以看见水从绿色管子上去 ，然后进入到铜管，再进入这个结构 ，上去又下来，然后经过这个CO2甘斯涂层的铜，得到供能后通过水管像雨一样滴下来 ，从而给植物供能，你能够看见它连接到很少的配件，连接到小的管子，连接到纳米箔的管子，然后到每个盘子，单独的持续的给每个植物供能，它们都接受到同等量的水，我们不是从商店买的任何过滤的装置，比如木炭或者其他什么，我用的自己的过滤器，这样人们就不会说有其他因素的影响，我用的是四分之一的渔网过滤器 ，你能够看见水从这个蓄水池被汲取到水箱里 ，然后水经过网，有13英寸的水流从排水管到贮水池，所以有足够的增氧，不需要一个空气设备对水里进行供氧，这运行的很好，它能够捕捉到进入里面不容易被捕捉的污染物，在3到4天内收集任何进入里面的残渣。<br> So there is no official filter in there at all its only nano coated structure and here is draft of the specimens A of the soil compared to being C which would be the CO2 gans in the drip feed systems and the bucket systems. And you can see the increase in growth compared to the soil and to be honest I have actually taken better care of the soil plants because I seen them they were not doing as well so I gave them a little extra tender loving care and you know and I did everything but add nutrients to them but still their growing they are really vibrant they are really green they still in the lighter pictures they are nowhere near the size of the other plants. This is the height growth chart with comparison of all 3 control systems and as you can see the difference in this also a notable difference this is the leaf count and you will see on this there is a notable difference that the leaf count went up almost any other day with the CO2 gans plant in the soil plants they would grow and then level off, grow and then level off cause you can see according to the chart.<br>道：所以在里面没有任何官方的过滤器，只有纳米涂层的结构，这一个图表是样本A的生长高度与样本BC的比较，样本B与样本C也就是用CO2甘斯滴灌以及雾桶系统 ，你可以看到植物相对于土壤的生长的高度在不断增长， ，平心而论，我更为照顾这个土壤植物，因为我看见它们做的不是很好，我给了它们额外的细心的护理，除了添加营养我做了所有的事情，它们长得很蓬勃，很绿，它们还是颜色较浅，不像附近其他植物的大小。这是生长高度的图表，3个样本系统的，你可以看见不同 ；这个也是一样的，很显著的不同 ，这是叶子数目的比较，你能看见有很显著的不同，叶子数目上升，在用CO2甘斯种植的额土壤里，生长，平衡，生长，又稳定平衡，可以根据这个图标看到。<br>[Renon]: Douglas we show the vedio<br>雷农：道格拉斯，我放视屏吧<br>[Douglas]: yes sir<br>道：好<br>[Renon]: Thank you Douglas, we are going to share a video another short explanation by Douglas of the run through of the whole setup so you can see it in video<br>雷：谢谢你，道格拉斯，我们会分享一个视屏，是由道格拉斯讲解整个设置的，所以你可以在视屏中看到是怎么回事<br>{From video}<br> Douglas February the 15th 2016 explaining my agricultural setup I have here. This is a water filtration device as you can see we got copper brass black iron galvanised inside the galvanised pipe there is pictures that show the nano structure out of copper that I made inside the tube here that’s the filtrate it goes down back up into the CO2 gans or t the energizer tube it’s a quarter inch copper tubing vinyl tubing, half inch on the outside The copper tubing is been nano coated it’s been caustic coated and fire coated and vinyl tubing has been nano coated there is CO2 gans inside of it as you can see these are the caps to fill the CO2 gans so all the line feed the dirt system. The dirt system feeds each plant equally and I have a device a valve where I can slow ones down and speed ones up.<br>道：这是道格拉斯，2016年2月15号，现在讲解的我的农业装置，这是我的过滤水装置， ，你们可以看到黄铜，黑色的铁，里面镀锌的管子 ，有图片展示这个纳米铜的结构，做在这个管子里面，这就是过滤管，水经过它后流下来，来到CO2甘斯 ，或者说是来到增能器管子部分，这是四分之一英寸铜管，乙烯管，外面是半英寸， 铜管是经过纳米涂层的，是经过烧碱涂层与火涂层，乙烯管是经过烧碱涂层的， 有CO2甘斯在里面，你可以看到这是盖帽，里面是CO2甘斯， ，这些线都成为滴灌系统 ，这个滴灌系统平等的为每个植物提供水源，在管子末端我还有一个阀门，用来调节水流</p>
<p>This is the soil I have got and open soil as you can see it’s a good color its healthy its vibrating but compared to the dirt feed with no nutrients just the energize water tap water mind you and my tap water is horrible. And this is R.O it came out of my filter system and it filters in 7.013 I think on the pH and 5ppm this is the CO2 gans in the soil as you can see compared to the other one in the soil it is almost 3 times the size. The CO2 gans requires water about once a week and this on requires regular water this one requires water every other day.<br>道： 这个土壤（04:22:28），你可以拨开土壤，你可以看到是很好的颜色，很健康，很有活力，与这个没有营养素只是用能量水供养的植物比较 ，这个是高纯反渗透水培植的，水是我的过滤装置出来的，PH值是7.013，未溶解固体是百万分之5，这是用CO2甘斯培植的土壤 ，你可以与这个高纯水培植的土壤相互比较，几乎是它3倍的大小 ，左边这个CO2甘斯土壤一个星期只需要一次供水，平常的水，而这个高纯水培植的土壤几乎每天需要供水。<br>This is a high pressure mist system and as you can see this was set in the motion on the second transplanted it went through a few days of shock and as you can see in less than 2 weeks look at the roof racks we got and the buckets we look at the series of jets that go around and it set on a timer and it feed 4 times a day now there is only CO2 in this bucket and distilled water that’s all that’s in there and I put 2 gallons of distilled water I put 20ml of CO2 gans in there straight CO2 gans to 2 gallons and you get you can see it’s got past the shark its growing like a weed now and roots are phenomenal and we have another trace set up here with another nano coated structure that we are going to hang up and have as soon as these seed over here germinated we do have some ginseng that has geminated finally and we set it down  over 10 January so it’s been over a month ginseng is a real hard plant to get to geminate<br>道： 这个是高压气培法， 这是经过移植的，经过几天的休克，你可以看到2周内出现的根须，在这个桶里你可以看到环绕的蒸汽 ，它是定时运作的，一天4次 ，在里面只有CO2甘斯与蒸馏水，这就是所有的，在里面我放入2加仑的蒸馏水与20ML的甘斯 ，将甘斯放入2加仑的蒸馏水里，你可以看到它现在度过了休克期，生长的像杂草一样，根部很显著，我们有另一个纳米材料结构的设置 ，在周围放一些种子在这里 ，发芽的。我们有一些人参最终发芽了，我们在1月10号确定了下来，已经超过1个月了，人参是一个很难发芽的植物<br>I have 5 in the CO2 that are geminated and only one and I am not sure about the one on the R.O water as for my other seed I got beef stack tomato in R.O and CO2 gans I got Mack more cucumber and water  in water CO2 gans and I’ve got cayenne pepper in water and co2 gans and you can see R.O water light is getting to it I broke it open today they still haven’t geminated which I am starting to wonder if these are some bad seeds I have had like I said ginseng is germinated now in the CO2 gans and I have a few of the tomatoes on the R.O and the CO2 gans that have geminated the rest of these seed are not germinated and I am wondering if they are too old they were in the package from last year and I thought I would try them they are not geminating so I am going to think that that might be a failure on these right here on these 4 but these 4 here are going to get put I got pink moss pellets and they will go in the pellets tomorrow or tonight actually and they will stay in the pellets until they come up above the soil and start root growth over in this tray with, I will put them in that float right there in that creek and they will stay there until they be tall enough to transplant and I will transplant to where they will be drip fed.<br>道：我有5个用了CO2甘斯的种子发芽了，只有一个，我不肯定，是用的高纯水；番茄酱种子用的高纯水，黄瓜种子用的CO2甘斯，红辣椒用的是高纯水与CO2甘斯， 你可以看见这个用高纯水的黄瓜种子裂开了，还没有发芽，我开始怀疑是否是种子的问题。就像我说的，在甘斯水中的人参发芽了，我有一些西红柿种子用了CO2甘斯以及高纯水，也发芽了，剩下的种子没有发芽，我在想是否它们是太老了，是去年包装的，我想要试一下，但没有发芽，我在想这4个可能失败了 ，这4个是这样大的颗粒 ，在今晚它们会是颗粒状态，直到它们出土会一直保持颗粒状态，会在这个盘子里生根，我把这个泡沫放在盘子里，直到生长到足够移植的程度，然后转移到这里进行滴灌</p>
<p>I am going to keep the CO2 gans in the drip feed section I will keep the R.O and soil over here on this side on the tomatoes. Construction of the energizer too we have put the schematic diagram and this is a small set up here it’s not an elaborate setup and it’s not big enough for a house as you can see it’s a low pressure drip feed system as you can see its not designed for high pressure even though I do have a pretty strong pump on it now nano coated can be made with a bigger pipe and bigger vinyl tubing to that to adequately accommodate household pressure or pressure that exceed 35-40 pounds this here is hard pipe copper hard pipe brass hard pipe black iron hard pipe galvanised with 4 pieces of nano copper inside of it in a spherical design that I call the filter and this is a nano coated copper filtration device like I said it circles the water to the energise tube, the energizer tube feed the plants they drain down through the drainer and they, my home made filter here which is a fish net as you can see its falling about 13 inches there is plenty of aeration there is no need for an air pump the pump continually feed 24/7 I’ve got a small heater in here to keep it above 70 degree in here this is problem this winter of trying to keep this place warm I then close this here and this inside of my building so I could keep this warm with the building gout here so now we got the problem solved we can have everything up and running properly like it should be this is just and upgrade like I said February 15 2016 and CO2 copper nano energizer tube water filtration device with the irrigation system and the CO2 gans can control the environment and high pressure CO2 gans high pressure sparing this setup with CO2 gans and like I said we go some more coming we have this one done here probably in  the next day or so Keshe nano coating the inside and outside is been caustic coated inside and I had to nano coat the outside and caustic coat it again and get it setup and it will be a drip also another drip irrigation system that will feed the soil plants over here so anyone you guys have a blessed day this is update for February 15 god bless each and every one of you<br>道：在滴灌阶段我会保持使用CO2甘斯，我会在这边的番茄上保持使用高纯水与土壤 。这个增能器的构建 ，我们做了示意图，这是一个小的设置，着不是一个精密的设计 ，对于房子来说不够大，你可以看见这是一个低压的滴灌系统 ，不是为高压设计的，即使我安装了一个很强大的泵。 纳米涂层的过滤装置可以做成一个更大的管子，一个更大的乙烯管，从而满足家庭的水压，也就是超过35-40磅，这个是黄铜硬管，黑色的铁管，镀锌的 ，还有4块里面的纳米铜， 里面是过滤的设计，我称之为过滤器，这个就是纳米涂层铜的设备，就像我说的它将水循环到增能管子，这个增能管然后供养这些植物 ， 排水系统是这里，我自己做的过滤器，用渔网做的，你可以看见它滴落的距离有13英寸，所以没有用空气泵的需要，这个泵持续的供能，我这里有一个小型的加热器使温度保持在70度以上，也就是使这里在冬天保持温暖，这是在我的建筑物里，所以我能够保持这里的温暖，所以我们的问题得到解决，使每件事情正常的运行，但这是刚更新的，我在2016年2月15号说过，所以CO2甘斯，纳米铜，组成供能管与水过滤装置，以及这个灌溉系统， ，这样CO2甘斯就能控制环境，高压的CO2甘斯 ，这个高压气培系统用了CO2甘斯，我们还有更多即将来临的新事物，这个 ，可能是明天，我要在里面与外面进行纳米涂层 ，里面已经进行烧碱纳米涂层，我还得对外面进行纳米涂层，再进行烧碱涂层，然后完成设置，就成为一个滴灌系统，就会给这里的土壤与植物供能，祝每个人安好，今天是2月15号，上帝保佑你们<br>{End of video}</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much<br>凯：很感谢你<br>[Renon]: Okay<br>雷农：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much indeed thanks<br>凯：真的很感谢<br>[Renon]: Okay sir there is one more thing that we will present I think Ren has this version of the cantaloupe as well he will gonna be sharing his findings can you share Reny?<br>雷农：好的，先生，还有另一件我们要展示的事情，我认为瑞尼对哈密瓜同样有设想，他会分享他的发现，你可以分享了吗，瑞尼？<br>[Renon]: Yeah<br>瑞尼：是<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I am sorry Reny can you give us one second please can you please make the blueprint for these available as fast as possible<br>凯：抱歉，稍等一下，瑞尼。你能尽快将这做成蓝图吗？<br>[Renon]: The drawings are for the 3D drawings already available I am just putting it in the cloud and it will be accessible by Rick so that it’s already there<br>雷农：3D的图画已经完成了，我已经放在云端了，瑞克可以获取了，所以它已经在那里了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: so if you can add it to the blue print on the agriculture please<br>凯：所以请你将它加入到农业蓝图中<br>[Renon]: Okay sir<br>雷农：好的，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay carry on please, now we got Reny<br>凯：好的，继续，现在由瑞尼<br>[Reny]: Yes  share my screen  I am going MR Keshe<br>瑞尼：好的 分享我的视屏 我马上开始，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thanks very much<br>凯：很感谢<br>[Reny] I would like to share my plans<br>瑞尼：我想要分享我的计划<br>[Rick] can you share your screen here okay good<br>瑞克：你能分享你的屏幕吗<br>[Mr. Keshe]: For those who don’t know Reny is part of the Keshe foundation innovation group so they do their own test as most of you would do, this is how we work in the natural as the rest , we don’t create sophisticated labs to put to do thing that it night look good just because it has to be this is how it’s done and it’s better to see this way exactly what all of us are doing in our own place. Carry on please.<br>凯：对你们中不知道的人来说，瑞尼是凯史基金会创新团队中一员，他们像你们中大多数一样做自己的测试，这就是我们如何工作的，以自然的方式，我们不创造复杂的实验室来做事情， 是事情看起来不错，只是因为它必须这样，这就是它如何做成的。这样比较好我们所有的人在我们自己的地方做我们自己的事情。请继续。<br>[Reny] okay we all know that we can use CO2 gans the water of the CO2 gans for the plants so we conducted our own test to verify we started the testing December 30 2015 and concluded January 26 2016 and the plants are still growing even at this time we have a couple of cantaloupe seedlings from very kind of or type of water so let’s say for tap for water we should leave water for that one and for rain water 2 seedlings for the plant and we have 6 different water being used during testing, I have plain water just plain water collected every time when it rains using a plastic container and the tap which passing through a regular filtration not the reverse osmosis one only the regular filtration like a filter then activated carbon then another ceramic filter just enough for human consumption that is the same water we use as drinking water.<br>瑞尼：好，我们都知道我们可以使用CO2甘斯用在植物上，所以我们组织了自己的测试来验证，我们在2015年12月30号开始测试，在2016年1月26号作出结论，植物在这个时候仍在生长，我们用了一些哈密瓜的树苗，应用不同类型的水，比如自来水用在一个幼苗上，雨水用在另一个树苗上，我们在测试中用了6种不同类型的水。我有雨水， ，每一次下雨的时候用一个塑料容器收集的；然后是自来水，经过平常的过滤器，不是成为高纯反渗透水，只是经过普通的过滤器、活性炭与另一个瓷滤器，能够让人类饮用，就如我们平常饮用的水。<br>Another is rain water but this time we put a nano coated copper inside the bottle of the container then the same water treated rain water but this time we treat it with gans water this rain water the treatment for Co2 gans here is only done during the first day of testing that is the water used every day or every time we water the plant that we only introduce the field of the CO2 no additional gans water directly on the plant, another water is tap water this also with the field of gans we don’t add the gans water just pass the water around the container where gans CO2 gans is inside so another one is rain water treated with nano coated copper the same as this one here but we add another additional exposure with the field of CO2 gans same as with the tap water so we have here the photographs the are arranged in this way rain water with nano coated copper this is the first this is D one so the rain water then this column is for rain water then rain water with CO2 gans water only this first I have to zoom in here only this first day we add the upper portion of the gans container but its water we let the water settle at the bottom then around 1ml of more we mix it with a little of water then we water this these 2 plants the rest  no more gans water but just the field.<br>瑞尼：另一个是雨水，但这一次我们将一块纳米铜放入容器里面；再一个也是雨水，这一次我们将甘斯放入里面，用的是CO2甘斯水，只用一次，在测试的第一天，雨水是我们每天或者每次浇灌的水，我们使用的是CO2甘斯的场而不是直接将甘斯水浇灌在植物上；另一个水是自来水，我们也用的是CO2甘斯的场，我们没有加甘斯水，只是将装有甘斯的密封容器放在水面上；另一个也是雨水，运用纳米铜进行处理，就像上面这个，但是我们增加了一个CO2甘斯场的影响，就像自来水样本一样。我这里有照片，我像这样安排在一起做比较 ，<br>用纳米涂层铜处理的雨水，这一排是第一天，这是雨水，这一条是自来水，这个是雨水加甘斯水，只是在第一天，我放大一下，只是在第一天，我们只是取的甘斯水容器的上层水，是在甘斯沉淀后，我们取1ML上层水，混合了一点水，然后给这两个植物浇灌 ，之后没有用甘斯水了，只有它的场的存在。<br>Okay next this is the Tap water its full with CO2 gans field this one is rain water with the nano coated copper and also exposed with CO2 gans fields so we are just fields here and this was the water only no gans on the soil or on the plants just the water so this is Day one and this day 7 to photograph everyday presented here some of the, let’s say every week. If we brought this on the photograph there is consisted data color on this one the with rain water with CO2 gans water other of similar colours but this one is different. Okay on the next we have here on this 16 we now have an obvious difference a very obvious difference on the growth the rain water is left behind here even with the nano coated copper that approach goes well buy this has small leaves than this one the tap water is behind the a least behind than the gans water that is also doing fine but it is rain water with gans with CO2 gans goes a lot faster and the colors are consistent if you look the previous stage the colors are very clear. I set my camera here to have a consistent view of this day 7 the camera shifting is the same<br>凯：下一个是自来水，暴露在CO2甘斯的场的影响下 ；再下一个是雨水，加上纳米涂层铜，也是暴露在CO2甘斯场的影响下 ，所以我们只有场在这里；这个水里没有甘斯在土壤或者植物上面，只是甘斯水（没有甘斯） ，这是第一天，这是第7天，我每天拍照，只在这里展示一些，每周的，如果你仔细看照片，这一组有连续的颜色 ，这是雨水里混有CO2甘斯水，其他组之间都是相似的颜色 ，但这一组是不同的（鼠标）。在下一页 ，这里是第16天，我们可以看到在长势上很明显的不同，用雨水的土壤被甩在后面，即使加上纳米铜，用自来水的植物长的不错，这个（右边）比这个（左边）有更多的叶子 ，至少比用甘斯水的植物落在后面，其他组长的也可以，但是用甘斯水的这一组长的更多更快，而且颜色更具有连续性，如果你看这一组与先前阶段的比较，颜色变得更暗了， ，我把相机放在这里有一个连续性的视图，在第7天相机位图转变是一样的，<br>so I don’t influence the camera shifting should not influence the color leave where are get the camera steady with the capture of the color so we have there are , the color are a lot darker here but this is very constant so here you might be tricked that the tap water have larger leave but if you look at the pot here the pots if further from the camera because I cannot capture the entire plant without zooming out so if we this for the tap water the one with gans the CO2 gans water is already aged with another segment here while this one has one segment extra segment and more leaves and the color is very significant here darker color on this one, okay I will zoom out this is a very good comparison among different treatment on water the, we want all of them that goes faster is to the one with CO2 gans water next is the with Tap water and together with tap water exposed with Co2 gans field then this one and then next is rain water treated with nano copper and the last one is rain water on.<br>瑞尼：所以我没有影响相机的位移，应该就不会影响到叶子的颜色，我用相机对叶子颜色是稳定的拍摄，这边的颜色有很多暗的 （右边2组），但这一个是很连续的 ，你看这个用自来水的土壤有更大的叶子。如果你看这里的罐子，这个罐子离相机拍摄的位置有点远，我需要放大才能看到整个植物 ，左边用的是自来水，右边是甘斯水，用甘斯水的植有更多的枝节 ，而左边没有枝节，用甘斯水的植物有更多的叶子，而且它的颜色很有意义，更暗。好，我缩小回来。这在不同样本水之间是一个很好的比较，生长最快的是CO2甘斯水样本组，第二是自来水样本组，以及暴露在甘斯场影响下的自来水组，然后是这一组（雨水，纳米铜加甘斯场影响的一组），然后是加有纳米铜处理的雨水组，最后是雨水组。（04:39:00）<br>Day 40 I notice some flowers already the plants are placed the backyard just outside our door so they are exposed outside over the sun expose the sun on this plant is only for half a day the area of the back is facing the east however it the placement of the plants they are beside the wall that fir a long time they are no longer exposed directly they have no sun direct sunlight exposure for eh rest of the day so it’s only in the morning so they must be delay they are exposed well whole day under the sun so it started there is more growth but for the test I keep everything consistent and their distance more than a foot apart on the fourth I received flower on them and on  the 20th day we changed our parameter our instant parameter I treated all of them with tap water treated with fields of CO2 gans  I don’t want the rest of the other plant left behind I want them to go together because its already conclusive that plant treated with the CO2 water is way ahead among the rest so on the 30th day I treated all of them with the same water that is exposed with CO2 in here the photo of the 23rd day so I started treating all of them on the 20th day the same quality water, you will notice if you compare it on day 16 the leaves here are becomes darker all of the becomes darker while this one is maintaining a much darker because its already ahead among the rest so at day 27 you will notice colors are much darker compare to day 16 which have no exposure of the same water so the rest will able to catch and 40 I have this flowering they are flowering already they are beautiful flowers and the other day the piece on February 16, almost all of them have this beautiful flowers , okay and I have another report from the farmer from the same using CO2 gans water on December 27 last year 2015 we conducted a free workshop for the people of Dabal city,<br>瑞尼：第40天，一些花已经开了，这个植物是放在外面的院子里，在我们的门外 ，所以它们暴露在户外，这个植物只是半天，这个区域是面向东方，然后很长时间内将它放在墙后，剩余时间内没有直接的太阳照射。所以只是在早上，它们一定是延迟了，它们一整天受到太阳的照射，出现更多的生长。我保持所有事情的连续一致性，它们的距离超过一英尺宽，我在第40天看到了花开，在第20天，我们改变了参数，我向每个植物喷洒带有CO2甘斯的自来水，我不想要其他的植物落后，我想要它们赶上来，因为已经得出结论，有甘斯水的植物相比其他条件的植物是一路领先的，所以在第20天，我对所有植物都用了CO2甘斯水，在这里23天，</p>
<p>我对所有植物施加与第20天同样的水，你可以与第16天作比较，叶子变的更暗了，它们所有都变暗了，而这一个还是持续一个更深的颜色 （指的是最初就加了甘斯水的雨水），因为它已经遥遥领先，在第27天你可以看到颜色比第16天更深了，第16天没有像后来那样加上甘斯水，所以其他组能够追赶上来，在第40天，我们看见了花朵，开出了美丽的花朵，在另外一天，2月16号，它们几乎所有都开出了美丽的花朵 ，我还有一个来自农民的使用CO2甘斯的报告，是2015年12月27号的事情 ，我们为达沃城市的人们开了一个免费的研讨会。<br> Dabal city is the largest in terms of land area and is located in the southern part of India now and its run with agricultural lands the participants around 50 of them were able to learn nano coating gans production to be and application of this material for health energy and agriculture and on February 13 a farmer attended us a workshop provide us a report that is rice plants are growing better after application of water treated with CO2 gans field this is just field of CO2 gans and the CO2 gans is inside a plastic a sealed plastic one we use as a CO2 gans patch foe the health application I suggested at that time when we pitched them we shared to them about how to make the patch I told them you can use on a pipe or the end most pipe where water comes out of the irrigation system to let water pass through on top of this patch that it can help pass it through the water the farmer did that only 2 weeks ago so at time the rise is already 58 days old when he took this photograph and for 2 weeks if you treated the water with gans field from the CO2 gans pipes the famer was surprised because they have this usual growth up rise the usual hype is only one metre the average high is only one metre but this one reached 110cm or 1.1m<br>瑞尼：达沃是陆域面积最大的一个城市，坐落在棉兰老岛南部，被农田所环绕，参与者大概有50人，学习纳米技术，甘斯生产，以及运用在健康，医疗，农业上的装置，在2月13号，一个参加研讨会的农民向我们提供报告说，他的水稻在运用了经过CO2甘斯场影响的水后，长的更好了，只是CO2甘斯场，CO2甘斯在一个密封的塑料管里面，我们常将CO2甘斯包运用在健康装置上，在那时，我们向他们展示如何制作包，我告诉他们你可以用在水管上，让水出来时经过它，用作灌溉系统，让水经过这个包的顶部，让水通过，这个农民只在2个星期前就做好，在那时，那个玉米已经生长了58天，他拍了这个照片，<br>在2个星期内用了经过CO2包的甘斯场的水，这个农民很惊讶，因为平常的水稻只有1米高，而这一个达到1.1米<br>so it’s much taller and the color is much greener darker usually rice has this yellowish on some areas and we compare it to the neighbouring rice field its rice it different from the rest and another problem to is this black bug it’s called black bugs the bugs east the rice leaves and they use pesticide for these and I suggest we have to stop using pesticide we have to try means of, I suggest but we saw this bug this, this also beans what if, just like we talk to other animals just the top at the moment however the farmer implemented out suggestion and to his surprise it is only his farm that is not eaten by these farms after that the rest and the neighbouring they were eaten by these bug and these people use pesticide and today while having the agriculture discussion I came to a realisation other than talking these other thing like these bug maybe the bug did not no longer have interest of eating this plant because of the energy in the area, because they are already energized so they don’t have this interest anymore in eating this rice plant so this is very good news for us and agriculture and another application that I have experience is on the tea plant, on the left side this tea plant almost lost all of its leaves I don’t know what happened at this tea plant I just noticed this plant on the side my wife is taking care of one of these plants so this happen I believe in December there is last year December I sprayed CO2 gans water that’s around 1ml or less that a cup of co2 gans water to a little of tap water so I sprayed it on the this plant and after 26 days this is what happen more leaves shiny leaves on the plant. So it is we proof we have verified the place in the CO2 gans water for the field from CO2 gans can help our plants. That would be all for my sharing today<br>瑞尼：所以它长的更高，颜色更绿，更暗，通常水稻在一些地区呈现黄色，我们将它与邻近的水稻田做比较，这个水稻与其他的不同。另一个问题是，水稻田有一种黑虫子，这个黑虫子吃水稻的叶子，他们用杀虫剂对付这些虫子，沃告诉他们我们必须停止使用杀虫剂，运用其他的方法，在研讨会上我建议要与这些虫子产生互动，就像我们与其他动物一样，我们需要不再使用杀虫剂，我们需要做的是告诉这些虫子不吃我们的植物，这个农民实施了我们的建议，令人惊喜的是，只有他的农田不再被虫子啃食，之后，其他邻近的农田被这些虫子啃食，那些人们使用杀虫剂。今天，在进行农业讨论后，我思考到，相比与这些虫子对话，这些虫子可能是不再对吃这些植物感兴趣，因为在这个区域能量的存在，因为它们已经得到供能，它们就对吃这些大米植物不感兴趣，所以这是对我们以及农业来说是一个好消息。另一个运用是茶树，<br>左边这幅图，这个茶树已经几乎失去了它的大部分叶子，我不知道这个茶树发生了什么，我的妻子在照顾这些植物中一些，在去年12月，我喷洒了CO2甘斯水，大约1ML或者一杯CO2甘斯水，加入一点自来水，我喷洒在这颗植物上，右边的图就是它经过26天后所发生的，更多闪亮的叶子出现了。这就是证明，我们经过验证，利用CO2甘斯的场能够帮助我们的植物。这就是我今天要分享的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you Reny carry on Renon<br>凯：谢谢，继续，雷农<br>[Reny]: so I have to stop sharing?<br>瑞尼：我来关闭分享<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Carry on Renon please<br>凯：请继续，雷农<br>[Renon]: Okay I think that all for what I have prepared but the drawing the detailed drawing that we have and I am going to communicate with Vince because Vince has already access so I will fill up the data on the cloud and Vince is going to pick it up just to put it in a proper place so it will be updated soon sir thank you<br>雷：好的，先生。那就是所有我们准备的，但更为详细的图画我们已经准备好了，我准备与文斯联系，因为文斯已经可以获取，所以我会将数据上传到云端，文斯会将它们整理在正确的地方，所以会很快更新，先生。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much thank you indeed.

Okay can you see that, you can see the video, okay I will start it.<br>马：好，稍等。你们能够看见吗，看这个视屏， ，好的，我要开始了 （04：49：32）   （扭动后灯亮）， ， ，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: WE this is very much thank you very much we know this you can run this for week for months this is something we did in early 2007 2008 this is the property of it till the container gets saturated with gans and then ti stops, its perfect we have seen this it’s the nano coating abortion of the energy on its environment, thank you very much<br>凯：很不错，很感谢你，我们知道这可以持续运行一周或者几个月，这是我们早在2007年，2008年做的，这是它的性能，直到容器里面的甘斯达到饱和，它就会停止下来，很好。这是纳米涂层在从环境冲获取能量，很感谢你。<br>[Mario]: can this be increase if you have<br>马：这个（电能）可以增加吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Its usually works with the it depends how many compartment you make it the bucket is big if you put 20 of these buckets next to each other you can run motor we done that we did that and we showed to an electrical magazine in 2000 and what you call it 8 9 something in that region they tested it one of the pictures in one of the books id for the gans where the gans paper is in here you see the compartments we ran the motors with it, you can put the connection in parallel and series and you can collect and once the water get saturated with gans and the power slowly dies out I have done this for months and I have said this before it beautiful to see it brings back a lot of good memories but after depending on the load you use then it disappears I used to send a message every day I have been enlightened I have been enlighten to be the check up and we never found out what it says to be enlightened was of use for us it was sent ot the red circle and so they knew we are In the right track and so…<br>凯：不，它通常运行，它取决于你在水槽里制作了多少个隔间，如果水槽够大，如果你放20个相互邻近的隔板，你可以运行一个马达，我们做过，我们向一个电子杂志展示过，他们测试过，有本书里的一个图片， 有甘斯纸在里面，你可以看见隔间，我们可以运行马达，你可以串联或者并联连接，一旦水中甘斯达到饱和，能量就会耗竭，我们做了几个月，我以前说过，看见这些很美妙，能够勾起我们很多的回忆，还有取决于你使用的负载，它会消失，你常发送电子邮件吗，感觉我要受到启发，跟踪事态进展，但我从没发现这些对我们有什么启发，这些邮件是来自红圈的，所以他们知道我们在正确的道路上<br>[Mario]; and there is one other thing you asked and he is working with rocks you make a fire with and he collected lots of them and he asked if they could be using for something<br>马：还有另一件事情，他问道，他工作在弗林，那里用火烧制岩石，他收集了很多，他问是否可以将它用在某些事情上<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I don’t know let him use them<br>凯：我不知道，让他使用吧<br>[Mario]: he is using testing<br>马：他正在测试<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes I don’t know<br>凯：我不知道<br>[Mario]: okay thank you<br>马：好，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay thank you very much, anything else to share?<br>凯：很感谢，还有其他要分享的吗<br>[somebody]; Mr. Keshe from Argentina<br>某人：凯史先生，我是来自阿根廷的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes can you speak louder please<br>凯：你能讲话大声一点吗<br>[somebody]：I would like to share some knowledge about Victor Shawburger about water the water when put it in high pressure tube it’s a dies it killed the water and in real osmosis filters you got high pressure and you take all the nutrients out of it so that water doesn’t give any nutrients to the soil, as you for the thin pipes you should use copper pipes and not steel pipe and choose those if you still use steel tools and plough negative catalyst of the soil and the plants you got to use copper tools or bronze<br>某人：我想要分享一些来自维克多-肖博格的关于水的知识，水在高压管中，就死了，杀死了水，在真正的高纯反渗透水中，你就有一个高压，你将所有的营养素从中拿走，那样的水不会给土壤任何营养素，还有水管，你应该使用铜管，而不是铁管，如果你还是使用铁具犁耕，那将对于土壤和植物来说是一个消极的催化剂，你要使用铜具或者青铜<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I have never that before thank you for your knowledge.<br>凯：我以前从没有听说过，谢谢你的分享<br>[somebody]: Yes Victor Shawburger was a very deep in studying all to do with waters.<br>某人：是的，维克多-肖博格对使用各种水有很深的研究<br>[Rick]: Give just some information on Mr. Keshe they have done scientific test on that apparently and they replaced the steel plough with like bronze at one point with much better results the iron gets in the soil somehow and depletes the soil and makes it turn into dust more readily rather than holding together as a soil.<br>瑞克：有一些信息，凯史先生，很明显他们做了一些科学的测试，他们将铁犁换成铜犁，并取得了良好的效果，铁犁用在土壤里会消耗土壤，将它变成一种灰粉，而不是将土壤聚拢在一起<br>[somebody]: We used to make these tools in Germany.<br>某人：我们在德国制作这些工具<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah but the point maybe let’s look at it the other way no we understand the science a little bit more maybe when we use copper ploughs or bronze ploughs which carry copper in them or whatever maybe every time we put them in drops of gans of copper with the copper in creates a gans<br>凯：是的，这一点可能，让我们从另一个方式看，我们科学性的理解一下，或许当我们使用铜犁或者青铜犁，携带了铜，每次我们使用的时候，创造出甘斯来<br>[somebody]: That could be it<br>某人：是的，有可能<br>[Rick]: I think so<br>瑞：我也这样认为<br>[Mr. Keshe]: that could be the reason we see this we have unravel the secret of creation and how life goes it very easy if you think only you think in one way in the way of the agriculture or whatever life force we can unravel a lot these we couldn’t understand because land contains salt and every time you plough it you create a very faint nano coating whatever is in the ash whatever in the ground and as you do it on regular basis you keep on ;leaving a little bit traces of gans in the soil or in the water<br>凯：可能那是原因，我们看见我们解开了创造的秘密以及生命运行的规律，这是很简单的，如果你认为农业的运行也是一种生命的力量在推动，我们能够解开很多我们不理解的秘密，因为土地包含盐分，每次你耕犁，你就创造了一种微弱的纳米涂层，在灰烬中，或者在土壤里，当你定期做的时候，你就会在土壤里或者水里留下甘斯的痕迹<br>[somebody]:  in the water in the pipe if you put marble is into the pipe where thte water circulates it creates vortexes and that’s livens the water up it give is life<br>某人：与水一样，在管子里，如果你把大理石放在管子里，使水发生循环，从而创造出漩涡，让水激活，给予它生命<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yeah lets explain what happens when you have a vortex condition anywhere vortex you amalgamate the energies  free energies or the plasmatic fields of the water in to one point into concentrating a certain atomic or plasmatic condition this we know you see this as we have a, as we have tornadoes and we have vortexes in our tornadoes and you usually at the point end of these tornadoes in the galaxies or in the biggest star formation we see them to be connected to the centre of energy and this is<br>凯：是的，让我解释一下所发生的，当你有一个漩涡，一个漩涡的条件，任何地方的漩涡，你就融合了能量，自由能量或者水的等离子体场达到一个点，浓缩为一个原子或者等离子体的环境，我们知道，你们看见，就如龙卷风，在龙卷风里有漩涡，在这个基础上你创造同样的事情，你通常在龙卷风的末端，或者在星系里，或者在最大的星型组合 中，我们看见它们连接到能量的中心，<br>[somebody]: 0 point energy is recorded<br>某人：是的，0点能<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Its not 0 its never 0 this is the seed that where all the energy is there is no 0 its actually full of everything, the 0 point is actually another word for black core which is totally wrong<br>凯：不是0，根本没有0，这是一个种子，是所有的能量，没有0，事实上是充满了所有的东西，这个0点是黑色核心的另一个词，是完全错误的<br>[somebody]: Yes but I interpreted 0 point as the 0 of the coordinates<br>某人：是的，是的。我将0点解释为0的协调，整合<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah but we call it the centre the principal point of it we call it, because then it has a meaning people when you say 0 its nothing there or whatever as coordinates its point of a star and a point of the star is usually the most powerful point of the structure because where most of the energy is deposited thank you very much for the knowledge. Thank you indeed<br>凯：是的，我们叫它中心点，主源点，因为它有一个含义，人们说0代表什么也没有或者连接协调什么，那是星星的一点，星星的一点是最强大结构的一部分，因为那是能量的沉淀处，很感谢你的分享，很感谢<br>[somebody]: Thank you<br>某人：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you indeed, anything else we have  or we call it a day<br>凯：很感谢，还有其他的吗？或者我们收工了<br>[Rick]: yes maybe we can just quickly run through a couple thing here Mr. Keshe there is an item here.<br>瑞克：是的，我们可以快速的浏览一下这几件事情，凯史先生，这里是一个目录。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can I ask while you one question Vince are you there please? Vince can you put the Keshe foundation the way immediately on the banner line we should write in big page we have official are on the site today and the government they want to look the banner they also want to attend the meeting of Dubai take it off the revolving let it be on the revolving banner just bring it where you put the interview with the lady that, yeah do it urgent because we know that there we have officials in couple of world leader on the line today because of the activities we are involved it shouldn’t be there, just put something there bring the banner down and then we can carry on. We are working very hard for promotion of the Keshe foundation meeting on 21st in Dubai and we been noted by world leaders we know what’s going on and in so many ways delegates form the governments will attend the meeting and this we need that urgent please thanks very much carry on please<br>凯：我能问一个问题吗？文斯，你在吗？你要把凯史基金会迪拜放在标语一栏，写在大的页码上，我们今天有官员在网站上，政府想要看这个标题，他们很可能想要参加迪拜的会议，让它处在循环中，成为一个循环的标语，就像在与那位女士进行采访中所做的。是的，赶紧做，我们知道，今天有几个世界上的领导者在线上，因为一些要参与的活动，它不应该在那里，放一些东西在那里，将标语拿下来，然后我们继续。我们加重宣传4月21号的迪拜会议，我们被一些世界上领导者所关注，我们知道发生了什么，通过很多方式，来自政府的一些代表会参加这次会议，这就是我们需要快速做好这件事，很感谢。请继续。<br> [Rick]; Okay we have person from china I believe I am not sure who it actually is only the name only its Lions Dang from china and he asks I want to make an energy cup is it right?<br>瑞：好的。有一个来自中国的人，我不确定他是谁，只有一个名字，Lions Dang，他问我想要制作一个能量杯，可以吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Why not he can do it why not<br>凯：为什么不，你可以做，为什么不<br>[Rick]: okay<br>瑞克：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: just do everything else in different layers of it top on it why not, there is no way we can see the knowledge is so vast and application we come up with what we think people in time of the disaster will make anything like this to survive and the find out they have survive he have one of our Keshe foundation follower he listens most probably today he was with us when there was a disaster he lives or live off just a couple of light water this is the way we do it works we know people use it and but remember just because you have the cup of life because you have the water now it has to be energy for the safer life your body consumes energy and you have to keep on continuously drinking from it as you eat and you have that process allows you to recycle the energy inside your body.<br>凯：做其他所有的事情，在它的不同的层，在它的上面，为什么不。我们看见知识是如此巨大，我们想到的都可以做成应用，在灾难的时刻，我们可以做出任何可以存活下来的装置，我们就可以发现能够活下去，我们有一个凯史基金会的追随者，他今天可能在听，他曾经与我们在一起，经历了一个灾难，就是靠几杯水活下来了。这就是我们知道的起作用的方式，我们知道人们在使用，但要记住，你有生命之杯，你还是需要水来为你的生命提供能量，你的身体还是要消耗能量，你要不停的饮用就像你吃东西一样。这样的过程能够让你在你的身体里形成能量的循环。<br>[Rick]: Douglas has an amazing story that he gave and on my teaching about his adventure with cup of life that radically change his life and those around him too because it changed him so it.<br>瑞克：道格拉斯有一个神奇的故事，在第9次教学中告诉了我们他的关于生命之杯的冒险， 剧烈的改变了他的生命，以及围绕在他身边的事情，因为也改变了他。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Does he want to explain to us, Douglas you better come back<br>凯：他想要向我们解释吗，道格拉斯最好回来<br>[Rick]: Sorry to get you involved there<br>瑞克：抱歉，把你牵扯进来了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Pardon?<br>凯：什么？<br>[Rick]: Hi Douglas<br>瑞克：你好，道格拉斯<br>[Douglas]: Yes Mr. Keshe<br>道：是的，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Explain to us what the cup of life has done to you?<br>凯：向我们解释一下，生命之杯对你做了什么？<br>[Douglas]: well a few of you in 2007 I was struggling with a debilitating injury in my lower back my spine was fused at the L5 and S1 vertebrae with 5 titanium rods which rendered me basically useless as a man being able to work and provide for my family which is brought about financial hardships and everything else that is followed along with it, anxiety depression weight gain you name it and I went down that road and have been going down that road ever since 2007 since Mr. Keshe introduced his technology in October I been adamantly researching and experimenting and when the cup of life come out you know I got me a up and made a cup and out of 2 whole cups I took it apart and a nano coated copper plate around the inner wall and chilled with some really good high quality CO2 gans and distilled water and distilled water and sale the cup back up and I, the first 2 days I drank from the cup  I was so energized that I didn’t know what to think I didn’t know what to do with all the energy and that point it’s been a progression that been a fairy tale really I had the doctors visit today I don’t eat but once a month but one a day now I got about 18hours a day full of energy I don’t eat very much at all my wife siting right her she can confirm this at the doctor today after visits since our work since the introduction of Keshe technology I have stayed at a constant 164 today I was 165.3 which is showing there is absolutely no weight loss my hair is becoming darker I lost some of the grey my skin tone around my arms is becoming tighter I joked with the students today to the point where the cup is giving me impression that I am getting younger which I laughed about but really it kinda is in a way it makes me feel younger it makes me feel emotionally better it has brought peace to my family there is nowhere near the animosity that goes on in my family anymore we are not in state fear of worry about this bill or that bill<br>道：好，你们一些人知道，在2007年，在我的后背下面有导致衰弱的伤，我的脊椎被带有5个钛棒的L5和S1椎体溶化，这使我基本成为一个废人，不能出去工作养活家庭，带来很严重的经济困难，以及其他随之而来的事情，<br>焦虑，沮丧，增重，我经历过，自从2007年我就经历过，自从凯史先生在10月介绍了他的科技，我就坚决的展开研究与实验，当生命之杯出来后，我就做了一个杯子，用2个分离的杯子，将纳米涂层铜板环绕里面的一层，然后装入高质量的CO2甘斯，还有蒸馏水，然后密封起来，在头两天，我喝杯子里的水。我感觉到被充满了能量，我不知道想什么，我不知道用这些能量做什么，从那时起，就有一个很大的进展，真的就如童话故事一样，我今天有医生过来探访，我现在一天只吃一次，我一天可以出去18个小时，充满能量，我根本就不用吃很多，我的妻子就坐在那里，她可以证实，在医生探访后，自从使用凯史科技后，我一直保持稳定的体重，今天是在164，以前是165.3，这表明完全没有重量减少，我的头发颜色更深了，我的头发少了一些灰色，我的手臂上的肤色变得更紧凑了，我今天跟学生开玩笑说，它让我感觉更年轻了，我笑了，但它确实在某种程度上让我感觉更年轻，在情感上感觉更好，这给我的家庭带来平静，在我的家庭中没有什么憎恨了，我们不在一种担心焦虑中了，担心这个账单，那个账单<br> you know I am able to get out and do things with my family now and I go to the store and be able to make it through the store for longer than 15 minutes without having to sit down so this part of a more productive part to my life it’s made me more interactive with my children I am able to get out and push my son around the yard on its little 3 wheeler and my girls I am able to do things with and you know I was never to chop wood again and I have been experimenting against the doctor’s recommendation because I trust Mr. Keshe far more than any doctor and I have busting wood for a month now continuously about every other day because I burn wood here as an alternative source of heat and I have not had any issues at all now am I completely pain free? No absolutely  not but is the pain subsided to where I am having a better quality of life absolutely this is the most amazing thing that has ever happened in my life I was overwhelmed with the gans from the beginning I fell in love with the gans there is something special about the gans and it touched me in my heart and I have followed my heart with working everything that I do involving the gans and l love my cup and father has wanting a cup he is 66 years old and I let him experience a little bit if the CO2 gans and he was amazed at the amount of energy that he had he said that you know he walks every morning at the local place and he has to down about 20 minutes and rest and when he had the CO2 he was his friends were asking him how come he was able to have all that energy he didn’t have to sit down and he didn’t want to tell anybody and he was kinda afraid to tell anybody that I had given him something because he didn’t know what it was and he didn’t understand it<br>道：你知道，我能够出去与我的家庭一起做事了，我去商店，能够逛商店超过15分钟而不用坐下来，所以这对于我的生命来说是一个富有成效的具有创造性的一部分，它使我更多的与孩子们互动，我能够出去，在院子里推动我的儿子的三轮摇椅，我可以为我的女儿做一些事情。你知道，我被告知不能再砍木头，我在实验不按医生的要求来做，因为我信任凯史先生远甚于任何医生，我已经打断木头有一个月了，几乎每个一天就做，一直在持续，因为在这里烧木头作为一种热量的替代能源，而且我没有任何问题，现在我是完全没有任何疼痛吗？不是的，当然不是。但是疼痛已经消退，能够使我过一种高质量的生活，这在我的生活中绝对是从没有发生的一种神奇的事情，从最开始我就被甘斯完全征服了，我爱上了甘斯，甘斯身上有一种特别的东西，在心中深深打动我，我遵循我的心做关于甘斯所有的事情，我爱我的生命之杯，我的父亲想要一个杯子，他已经66岁了，我让他体验了一下甘斯，他对所感受的能量很惊奇，他每天早上在当地散步，他要每隔20分钟就停下来休息，当他用了CO2甘斯后，他的朋友就问他，他怎么能够这样一直都有精力而不用停下来休息，他不想要告诉任何人，他是有一点担心一旦告诉任何人，我就要给他们一些东西，他不知道它是什么，不理解，<br>but since my visit,  I’ve gone back home he has reminded me three times on the phone please send him one of these cups that he can’t wait for his cups to get in the mail and I go 12 new cups I am making right now to pass out to different people and in my life whether friends or family they have emotional problem or problems that are not exactly right in their life the way I look at it and the way I can understand it is the cup makes things right as I explained to my students today I was a coffee drinker and I was a cigarette smoker the cup has a I call it a judging effect you know it tell me when thing that I put in my body that are not good for me and it does so by some kind of communication that is hard for me to explain but I knew the cigarettes were causing me problem and the cup was informing me that and after being years of smoking you know regular hard smoker I have not touched a cigarette in 30 days witnesses for that too I was a coffee drinker 3,4 pots a day about a week ago the cup was telling me I can’t drink the coffee and more and it was coffee and more so it was causing an interaction the cup is correct Mr. Keshe likes to use that word I am using his phase the cup is correct so I put something in my body that is not correct os the body informs me of it.<br>道：自从我从他那里回来后，他在电话里就三次提醒我要送给他一个杯子，他迫不及待的想要在邮件里得到它。我现在制作了12个新杯子寄给不同的人，在我的生活中，无论是朋友还是家庭，他们有情感上问题或者生活中遇到的不顺心的事情，我仔细看并能够理解，杯子能够让事情变好，就像我今天对学生说的，我是一个酗咖啡的和吸烟的人，这个杯子起到一个判断的作用，它告诉我当把一些东西放进身体里对我是不好的，这是通过某种形式的交流，我很难解释清楚，但我清楚吸烟引起了我的一些问题，这个杯子提醒我，在几年的吸烟后，在30天内我已经没有碰过一根香烟，也有证人。我是一个嗜好咖啡的人，一天3到4壶，大约一个星期以前，这个杯子告诉我不能再喝这个咖啡，这会造成一种互动，这个杯子是正确的，凯史先生喜欢用那个词，我也在使用他的词，这个杯子是正确的，我将一些东西放进身体里是不好的，所以身体在提醒我。<br>I quit drinking coffee I longer have that reaction so when I put things in my body that I know aren’t good for me and I know it myself the cup also communicates with me that they are not good for you so the cup has some very special to it that are sometimes hard for me to explain because I am a layman you know, in this kind of technology its absolutely amazing and I have said time and time I owe Mr. Keshe my life because he is give my life to me back and my family is also very grateful included and my children and my father he is very grateful to Mr. Keshe because he has seen me go through some really hard time in the last 2 year especially and no the cup does not communicate with me verbally no absolutely not it’s a reaction that I get in my body, I call a hyper sensitivity action my body becomes acutely aware of something almost immediately after ingesting it if it’s not right like I have almost quit eating meat<br>道：我放弃了喝咖啡，我不再有那个反应，我将一些东西放在身体里，我知道对我来说是不好的，我自己知道，这个杯子也在与我联系，提醒我这对我不好，所以这个杯子很特别，有时这对我来说很难解释，因为在这项科技里面我是一个外行，它很神奇，我一遍又一遍对自己说我的生命是凯史先生拯救过来的，因为他让我又能够生活，我的家庭很感激，我的妻子，还有我的孩子和父亲，他很感激凯史先生，因为他看见我经历过痛苦的时期，尤其是过去2年。不，杯子不是与我进行语言沟通，当然不是，它是在我的身体里的一个反应，我称之为“超敏作用”，我的身体在消化东西后立即变得对这些东西异常敏锐，如果这些东西不对头的话。我都几乎放弃吃肉了。<br> I still consume a little it’s just there something about it that it just it’s a feel it’s a hyper sensitivity it makes my body feel different when I eat vegetable I don’t have that effect when I drink water I don’t have that effect its only when I drink a soda I have that effect so it’s the things that I put in my body that we know aren’t good for that is causing that reaction from the curve so I adhere to the cup I drink form the cup all day long I fill it up once the night before I go to bed and I place an apple on top of it cause the taster of the apple ti draws it into the apple the smell is absolutely phenomenal I can’t even explain how a cup could do that and the taster after 4 hours you get a hint after 12 hours you get the whole taste of the apple but no sweetness at 24 hours the letting it set with the apple on top of it, it is an amazing taste like apple cider without any sugar at all and the smell is phenomenal and it becomes intriguing to bring different fruits on there to get the different tastes of the fruit<br>道：我仍然在食用一点肉，那是一种感觉，是超敏感应，让我的身体感觉到不同，当我吃蔬菜的时候我就没有那种效应，当我喝水的时候，也没有那种感觉，而当我喝苏打的时候，我有那种反应。当我把一些东西放入我的身体后，我们知道那对我们不好，从而从杯子那里引起那样的反应，所以我坚持用这个杯子，我一整天从这个杯子里喝水，一天晚上，在睡觉前，我在杯子里装满水，将一个苹果放在上面，水尝起来就像苹果的味道一样，气味是完全自然的味道，我无法解释一个杯子能够做到这一点，这个味道，在经过4小时后，有少量苹果的味道，在12小时后，你就得到完全苹果的味道，但没有甜味，在24小时后，就让苹果一直在上面，就是一个完全神奇的味道，就像完全没有盐分的苹果汁，气味是自然的，这是很吸引人的：将不同的水果放在上面就得到不同水果的味道，<br>No one I am going to get the nutrients from the fruit because the field forces are drawing from the fruit into the cup as Mr. Keshe from the cup so this is proof again these are 2 thing in my life involving Mr. Keshe’s technology that I have experienced for myself and witness it around and I am experiment with people on my cup you know we have experimented a friend of mine has actually no a friend of mine a friend of my wife’s says a problem with medication so let her drink from the cup and she didn’t have to have no medication for a whole day since she went home cleaned here house and she felt better than she felt years and could I make her a cup so I have done 3 independent test on this and they have all confirmed on the same results and that’s why I went ahead and purchased what I could and the local place all the cups that I had so I could put into production these cups and get them out to people that would really benefit from that would be poor the needy and the people that can’t they can’t make these cups or don’t have the access to make them or don’t have the financial means to make the cups<br>道：没人知道我会得到水果上的营养，因为场强从苹果那里被拖拽到杯子里，就像凯史先生之前讲过的，所以这又是一个证明，这2件事情在我的生活中与凯史先生的科技相关，我自己亲身经历，并且目击到，我在用我的杯子在一个朋友上做实验，事实上是我的妻子的一个朋友，有药物上的问题，所以我让她喝杯里的水，她一整天就不用吃药了，自从她回到家，清理房间，她感觉更好了，问我能否为她制作一个杯子，所以我已经在这上面做了3个独立的测试，他们都确认了相同的结果，这就是为什么我买了当地所有的杯子，这样就能投入到生产，一些可怜穷困的人们可以从中受益，人们或者自己不能制作出来，或者找不到方法，或者没有财力制作出来<br>[Mr. Keshe]: People are asking how do you make the cups<br>凯：人们在问你是热河制作这个杯子的<br>[Douglas]: Yeah sure no problem at all. The cup is a double wall cup which you can pick up at and dollar store that you have in the states and I am sure have them around the world and they are a dollar a cup they are a double walled cup I get.<br>道：是的，当然没有问题。这个杯子是一个双壁杯，你可以在便利店买到，我相信世界各地都有，一美元的杯子，一个双壁杯<br>[Rick]: Do you want to show it I could,<br>瑞克：你可以展示一下吗<br>[Douglas]: I sure can if you would like me too<br>道：当然，我能。如果你让我<br>[Rick]: If we have time Mr. Keshe for this<br>瑞克：如果我们有时间，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: WE have whole day to do it<br>凯：我们有一整天的时间<br>[Douglas]: Do you need me to share screen Rick?<br>道：可以让我分享屏幕吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah<br>凯：好<br>[Rick]: Yeah you should be able to there now I think<br>瑞：你那边应该可以了<br>[Douglas]: Okay which screen I share desktop<br>道：好的，我在桌面上分享一下屏幕<br>[Rick]: turn off the<br>瑞克：你要..<br>[Douglas]: I got it<br>道：我知道了<br>[Rick]: He is learning fast he is on the fast path<br>瑞克：他学的很快<br>[Douglas]: wanted to get out of everybody’s way there maybe wont affect too many people now this is my cup right here that I drink from every day and I have a cup here that I cup here that will go through my microwave this is my instruction cup as you can see my apple is on top of it, it’s a fire coated cap with CO2 gans and distilled water and this is wow I can’t say enough about the cup  the process of making the cup have a clear double wall cup you can get and dollar store they are usually a dollar I heat razor blade along the seam what way you won’t crack or bust apart and you make a nice seam you don’t have a jiggered seam you separate the cup then you can take a piece of paper like so and wrap around the cup till you get the, till you get the conical shape of the cup and then you use a pair of scissors to cup it out and then you got a diagram which you can lay on copper of a sheet of paper and they you on the sheep of cooper and the diagram will come out looking like this in this kind of fashion here when you heat the copper it re enhance the coppers it makes it like putty you can bend it real easy you won’t pink it you won’t do this without enabling the copper that means getting hot to rainbow color as you can see its rainbow color then, then you can wrap the copper around the cup like so, alright now once your form and you got the way you want nice and snug then you can continue with the fire process what I did is I fire coated this and then I fire coated mine 5 times so its 16 coating and then I placed it back on the cup I inserted it with my gans and I put a 20ml of concentrated CO2 gans in here and as you push the cup down the gans will rise and have to do this a couple times to get the water level up to where you want it to mix with the gans<br>道：每个人都有自己的方式，希望不会影响太多的人，好了。这就是我的杯子 ，我每天从里面喝水，  左边这个是我快速做出来的，是我的教学杯；你可以看到我的苹果在上面，这是一个用火烧以及烧碱涂层制成的杯子， 用了CO2甘斯以及蒸馏水，这是，哇，我无法用语言来形容，这个杯子的制作过程是，有一个清晰的双层壁 ，你可以从一美元商店里得到，它通常是一美元，我给剃须刀片加热，沿着这个结合口（缝合）处 ，这样就不会让杯子裂开或破裂，这很简单，可以做出很好的接合口，密封口。将杯子分开来， ，然后拿一张纸， ，包裹这个杯子， ，直到你形成这个圆锥体，用一对剪子，将它多余的剪下来， ，你就会得到一个图纸，按照这个纸片的图纸做成相应的铜片，然后再放上铜片， ，这个图纸就会成形，看这个 ，有种时尚，当你给这个铜片加热，这个铜片很易弯曲，也容易戳孔，你不会这样做的，这个铜片加热就会变成彩虹色 ，你看见这是彩虹色，然后将这个铜片包裹这个杯子，   ，一旦你得到这个样式，做到你觉得好的与舒适的为止，然后你继续进行火烧的程序，我用火涂层，做了5次，16个涂层，然后把里面的杯子放进去 ，然后再放入一个装有CO2甘斯的容器里面 ，我放了20ML浓缩的甘斯， ，当我向下挤推这个杯子的时候，甘斯就会上升， ，你需要多做几次使得水达到你想要的高度 ，与甘斯相混合。（05：14：17）<br>so you add water and push down on the cup until it comes up till you get it where you want it and you push down and I see with the rubber seam and allow weight to sit on it upside down with the weight sitting on top of it which I use my big thing the bible sitting on top and I leave it set for 24 hours and then the cup is sealed and its ready to start putting water in now I have done test with meter on the cup I have this cup with the fire coating tone raise the pH up but it takes 4 hours with the caustic and the fire caustic the pH raise up in hour, one hour exactly it jumps up drastically it will take a R.O water which has nothing in it which the guy said a while ago reverse osmosis water has no nutrients at all no dissolved solids and it usually comes out of the R.O at about 7 neutral and it raise the pH up and the R.O water to almost 8 in an hour raise the ppm and the undissolved solid I fire coat first yes and then I, I fire caustic to get my the structure form the way that I want it so the metal is malleable and solid and I can pour it on any fashion that I need and when I am done with the final forming of the cup then I caustic coating like I said I did mine 5 times testing caustic that has worked for me and Mr. Keshe I can’t tell how many times I will say it for the rest of my life thank you because you have given me my life back and you have given me my family back and that something I thought I had lost for good<br>道：所以加水，向下压杯子，直到它上来，达到你想要的位置，我看见有橡胶缝合口的，能够让杯子倒过来， ，你可以用一个重物压在上面，比如用一本圣经， ，让它这样放置24小时，杯子是密封的，然后倒水进去，我用米表在杯子上做了实验， 这个杯子是用火烧制成的，让PH值上升，花了4小时；但这个烧碱涂层 ，PH在一个小时内上升，很剧烈的向上跳动，是用的高纯反渗透水，没有任何东西，就像先前那个人说里面没有任何营养素，低量的溶解固体，高纯水一般是7，这个杯子在1个小时内使得它的PH值上升几乎达到8，提高未溶解固体量，最初我是火烧的，是的，然后是烧碱，火烧就能让我得到这个结构体，金属就会变得具有延展性和柔软，做成我想要的样子，当最后形成杯子的形状时，我用了烧碱处理，我做了5次的烧碱蒸汽处理，这个杯子就能为我工作了。凯史先生，在我剩下的生命中，我不知道要说多少遍，很感谢你，你重新给了我生命，让我的生活回来了，让我的家庭回来了，有时我在想有些失去是值得的，是好的。<br>[somebody]: Douglas I love you thank you thank you so much<br>某人：道格拉斯，我爱你，很感谢你<br>[Douglas]: Thank you very much for sharing your knowledge with me I am poor old country and this is my life, I am at a lost for words from my height they is nothing I wouldn’t do for Mr. Keshe.<br>道：谢谢你们，感谢你们与我分享知识，我只是一个穷的乡村伙计，这是我的生活，我说不出话了，从我的内心里，没有什么我能够做的了，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much<br>凯：谢谢你<br>[Rick]: Thank you so much for offering that Douglas it takes a lot to say that thank you,<br>瑞克：谢谢你，道格拉斯带来了很多，谢谢你<br>[Douglas]; thank you guy thank you<br>道：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I thank you for being there and bring us a lot of joy you said a lot of thing which it was just sitting and going like what we call dejavu we have seen by using the cups losing the appetite for smoking it’s just that it’s not the body it’s just changes because you use it changes the, because you use a CO2 and if you make some zinc gans into it on top it bring a lot interesting emotional comfort so not only add the CO2 add the zinc oxide gans into it we have seen people who have addict to cocaine within the first 3 days they were just go vomiting if they come near cocaine and they are using the same technology we seen people who been paralysed drinking and using the cup after 27 years of walking of the wheelchair the process is very simple and the system when you drink it gives you what is lacking in emotion in what we call understanding of the emotion which connects it to the zinc and to the copper in a way the CO2 is not a pure CO2 when you produce it there is some medical zinc oxide in it so it gives you in a way we look at the energy just we need to eat to have energy our emotion too, so with this cup because of what the way you constructed with the zinc and CO2 you both with the nano coating of the copper you feed the soul the emotion<br>凯：我感谢你在那里为我们带来很多的喜悦，你说了很多的事情，就像似曾相识，我们看见过一些人使用这个杯子失去了吸烟的欲望，它不只是身体，它改变，因为你使用，它改变，因为你使用CO2甘斯，如果你制作一些锌甘斯，放在里面，可以带来更多的情感上舒适，所以你不仅可以使用CO2甘斯还可以加入氧化锌甘斯。我们看见一些人对可卡因上瘾，在头三天，如果他们接近可卡因就会呕吐，他们也使用同样的技术，我们看见瘫痪的人饮用这个杯子的水，27年的轮椅生活，这个处理过程是很简单的，当你饮用的时候，这个系统就会给你情感上所缺乏的，就是我们所说的理解情感与锌和铜相连接，在某种程度上说这个CO2不是纯的CO2，当你生产这个CO2时就会有氧化锌在里面，从某个方面看能量，我们需要通过吃东西补充能量，也满足情感需要。所以建构的这个杯子，有锌与CO2，都是用纳米铜制作出来，你就满足了灵魂与情感<br>you feed the copper the neural system which is the muscle tissue and with the gans you feed with the gans of the zinc you feed your inner emotion which is totally 2 different thing and so you feed what is the missing and now that’s what you feed first we have seen this many year and it nice to see how you have made a layman can do it and when you said your father can do these thing we have seen this many times, we seen people in bed people who could not walk more than 2, 300m they do 10km which is if people who see this things do happen because the material in the cup is made other material in your body so when you transfer the plasmatic energy of it in your body you have already absorbed the minute you touch the man,  a lot of time I have said to a lot of our people is that we drinking these water they actually the minute the energy touches you lips the energy is transferred the water is just a converter if you use even else would do that same but one thing more you can do with what you have make a cup lid for it and make a hole in the lips and put a straw in it breathe it and that feeds your lungs so you need to breathe not the water but you suck the air but you have to make the air flow very very slow  that the conversion take place this is the,<br>凯：你用铜供养了神经系统也就是肌肉组织，你通过锌甘斯供养了里面的情感，这是完全不同的事物，所以你供养了，什么是漏掉的，现在那就是你所供养的，我们看见这些事情很多年了，你能够做出来这是很让人高兴的，一个外行人能做出来。当你说到你的父亲能够做这些事情，我们也看到很多次了，我们看躺在床上的人，不能走超过200到300米的，现在能够走10km了，人们看见这些事情，这些事情确实发生了，因为杯子的材料构成就是你的身体的材料构成，所以当你将等离子体的能量转移到你的身体，当你碰到的瞬间你就立刻吸收了，很多次，我对很多人说过，我们喝这些水，当这些水碰到你的嘴唇的瞬间能量就得到转移了，水只是一个转换者，如果你使用，任何其他的东西都能够做同样的事情，有一件你可以多做的事情，你在杯子上做一个杯嘴，在杯嘴上做一个洞，放一个吸管在里面，吸它，呼吸，就会给你的肺部供能，你能够从里面呼吸，不是水，是空气，但你要让空气流动很慢，这样转换就会发生。<br>I have made it people used to make 3 cups and then 2 cups and more of less it was a combination of what you see in different levels if you add fat that the amino acid on top of you container you find you hardly need to eat so you find out so you receive protein level this is what we were teaching for the time of disaster people who do not have food with these cups, these kind of thing sis the only way to receive protein energy when we say protein and an apple  is a protein cauliflower is a protein based wheat is 80% protein and all sorts of things you don’t need meat only anything you eat is amino acid based so in the time of disaster or in the time of even hunger if you add the CO2 the copper you put in there and then you put the zinc oxide CH3 and the amino acid you never need ot eat this is the beauty with it and that why the cups are there we are testing these gases that I said here and with another person which I brought here with me and made and you can do the same if you made the pain pen if you add the CH3 if you add some of the fat which you collected and seal the pen put the pen in water it gives you the same energy you don’t need to make a cup.<br>凯：我们看见过，我做过，以前常常是先做3个，再做2个，差不多这就是一个在不同层次上的组合了，如果你加上脂肪，也就是你的容器的顶部的氨基酸，你会发现你不会想吃什么了，你接收到了蛋白质层面的能量，这是我们为灾难发生时的人们进行的教学，那时人们没有食物，用这些杯子，这种方法会是唯一接受氨基酸能量的方式，当我们说到氨基酸，苹果是以蛋白质为基础的，油菜花是以蛋白质为基础的，小麦是80%的蛋白质，还有各种各样的东西，你不需要肉，任何你吃的东西都是以氨基酸为基础的，所以在灾难的时刻，在你饥饿的时候，如果你加上CO2甘斯，装置里面也有铜，你放上氧化锌，CH3，还有氨基酸，你就不需要吃什么了，这就是美妙之处，这就是杯子的作用，我们在测试这些杯子，我说过在这里我与一个我带来的一个人一起制作，你们能够做同样的事情，如果你制作止痛笔，如果你加上CH3，如果你加上一些你所收集的脂肪，放在笔里，密封，把笔放在水里，就会给你同样的能量，你就不需要制作杯子。<br> You can feed yourself and do the same thing just leave it like a what I call a spoon in the water and you receive all the energy from it. But you have to understand what you do and how you do it and the, we launch the pain pens from tomorrow these pain pens you can use them for anything even feeding yourself not even just putting it aside when you have a pen you can drink it it gives you the same kind of energy  as a pain relief you don’t need to buy an aspirin because in some pains you cannot put a pen on, just put a pen in the water the pain pen which is made in the water and drink the water you get the same reaction. Yes you can mix the ganses this is the opportunity you can do a lot of things one of the thing if you can find a clean reservoir natural waters same like north of England you can do in that district area you, if you make a gans from these kind of things there is not much pollution these are one of the best ganses to use because it naturally balanced if you have any deficiency in short of an element in your body if you use the caustic of sulphur<br>凯：如果你供给自己，做同样的事情，就像把羹匙放在水里，你就会从它那里接受到所有的能量。但是你必须理解你在做什么，以及如何做。我们明天会释放止痛笔，这些止痛笔你可以用来做所有的事情，即使是供养你自己，不只是你身上哪里有痛就放在哪里，你可以饮用，它给你同样的缓解你疼痛的能量，你不需要买阿司匹林，因为有些疼痛，你不能只是将笔放在上面，将笔放在水里，笔的构成就会影响到水，饮用这个水，你就会得到一样的治愈。是的，你可以混合甘斯，这是一个机会，你可以对它做很多的事情，有一件事，如果你能找到一处有天然水的蓄水池，比如你可以在在英格兰北部的一些地区做，如果你从这些没有多少污染的水里面制作甘斯，就会是最好的甘斯之一，因为它具有自然的平衡性。如果你的身体里有缺陷的，不足的元素，如果你使用硫磺的碱性。<br> if you can make some very very slight amount of it just add one drop in the whole pack this will allowed the energy to be balanced in your body even, especially people who have a problem with the third gland it received the energy that you find out it balance the third gland very small amount of sulphur you find even you nail changes your habit changes your posture changed because sulphur I was teaching this to I think to the people when you are in hospital phosphor you need it because sulphur you need it because in our body is the regenerator of the balancing of the change if you can make a gans of if you can do it very very little amount of it not much maybe one drop in the whoa cup is more than enough and you will find out the body will start transferring its own mineral to the right way and you will achieve what you need, yes sulphur in the gans state and on the other hand if you got the problem with haemoglobin or you have a problem with red blood cells counts if you have diseases like the blood cancer add the small amount very small amount put the, when you make the CO2 I was teaching yesterday in a private teaching put the CO2 put a small nail metal nail into or barely just touching th gans the protein gans on top of the container that it becomes red drop trickles red drops of this is the blood haemoglobin<br>凯：如果你能制作很少很少量的，将一滴滴入这个包裹里面，这就会让你身体里的能量达到平衡，尤其是那些第三腺有问题的人，它会接收到能量，你会发现它平衡你的第三腺，很少量的硫磺，你会发现你的指甲改变了，你的习惯改变了，你的姿态改变了。因为关于硫磺，我对在菲律宾医院进行试验的人讲过，你需要磷，你需要硫磺，因为在我们的身体里它是对改变进行平衡的再生器，如果你能把它做成甘斯，如果你能制作很少量很少量的硫磺甘斯，或许只是一滴滴入杯中就足够了，然后你会发现你的身体会将自己的矿物质转换到正确的方向上，你会实现你所需，是的，硫磺的甘斯状态；在另一方面，如果你有血红蛋白方面的问题，有红血细胞数量方面的问题，如果你有血癌，加上少量的，当你制作CO2甘斯，我昨天在一个私人教学中讲过，将CO2甘斯，将小金属钉只是接触到容器顶部的蛋白质甘斯，就会变成红降，将红将取出，这就是血的血红蛋白<br> and we can out it in a cup the same way as you shown it and then you find out you overcome blood cancer very rapidly because the body picks up the energy which is need for blood these are pure bloods doesn’t matter you are type A, B whatever you are, these are the things that we start opening up and people are trying and we can return back to us. They are different way I have used this for nearly 15 years all the system built and we see result for it is built in that way but using magnets and hiding nano materials in it and the gans materials in it now because when you do it the way you do it I used to do it with the magnet you create a dictate a lot of position here you don’t have any condition for position all the elements of the body receives if they don’t need but when you have a problem a cup the way you have it if you can put it like a circle and sticking in certain positions you can dictate where you want energy you want it in the liver you want it in the lymph. Turn your cup upside down the cup you have in your hand turn it upside down please, Douglas, can you hear me.<br>凯：然后你可以放在杯子里，就像你先前展示的，你就会发现你能很快克服血癌，因为这个身体吸取能量，这个能量是血所需要的，这是纯净的血，不管你是A型血，B型血或者其他什么，这些是我们会开始教学的，人们会实验，然后向我们反馈报告。这是不同的方式，我已经使用了15年了，做了所有的系统，看见了结果，像那样建造，但用的是磁铁与隐藏在里面的纳米材料与甘斯材料，现在因为当你做，你做的方式，我常使用的是磁铁，你创造了，控制了大量的位置与状态，在这里，你没有创造为所有元素所接收的环境，如果它们不需要的话就没有。但如果你有问题，你有杯子，如果你能把它排成一个圆圈，或者固定在特殊的位置，你就能决定你的哪里需要能量，你想要在肝脏中，你想要在在淋巴中。将你的杯子倒立，道格拉斯，听见了吗<br>[Rick]: can you please turn the cup upside down Douglas<br>瑞克：你能把杯子倒立，道格拉斯<br> [Mr. Keshe]: turn you cup upside down the one you just showed us.<br>凯：把杯子倒立，展示给我们看<br>[Douglas]: I can turn the other one that I got made upside down,<br>道：我可以倒立这个<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay the top end because all the energy goes and the combination of at the bottom the top end is your head if you put  a line I have shown this in some of the private teaching in the knowledge seekers in the first or second term when they were in Rome. If you divide it into 3 pieces divide it, don’t shake it doesn’t matter if you go from the top where it is now to the where you drink the top end the one third top is the position of your brain and your head the middle part is, no no turn it upside down yeah, divide this it’s not just about equal and from the top to bottom you take the top and let me go on my screen you come off and I show you in my teaching, go back on, can you stop sharing please Douglas.<br>凯：好。这个顶部末端，因为所有的能量运行以及组合都在底部，这个顶部末端就是你的头部，如果你放置成一条线，我在罗马的第一和第二学期的私人教学里对知识寻求者讲过，如果你将它分成3块，不要摇晃，没关系，如果你从顶部，也就是你现在饮用的位置，这个顶部末端，三分之一的顶部就是你的头部与大脑的位置，这个中间的部分，不，不，倒立过来，倒立过来，将它平均的分块，从顶部到底部，你拿着这个顶部末端，让我回到我的屏幕，你退出，我展示给你看，你能停止分享吗，道格拉斯<br>[Douglas]: yes<br>道：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay then I show you in teachings then you know when you make these cups how you can overcome a lot of problems am I? Can you see my<br>凯：好，我在教学中向你们展示，然后你们就知道当你们制作这些杯子的时候，你们怎样克服很多的问题。你能看见我的<br>[Rick]: no we see the desktop, now we see it<br>瑞：不。我们看见桌面，现在看见了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay this is your cup what you do you divide you cup in 3 levels and this is where you drink from this is the open end this side hear this is your head this side is your lung and heart and this side is your stomach and leg here in certain part is your arms and here in the end is your legs so your head is up here you can create patches you know they you use patches you put on your body the gans patches you can make small gans patches and then dictate which part of the head brain you want and then you decide where you want to affect if it’s the liver or a kidney or is it just a bulb a liver you want to do or you want to do a lung or left or right lung do you want operate within , within what you call it within the heart here in this inside just above important for liver and kidney even though the liver and kidney just sit on this arm because then what you have to do you put your livers and kidneys and everything else if it is the womb or prostate problem here. And then you turn the cop upside down in a way people can do it, if can do it I don’t know if I can turn my picture when it turns upside down when you drink from it most of the energy is this part you don’t need that much energy here and them as you drink the cup you put your straw where your illness us if you have problem with you lungs you always drink form here you start and the water as it comes down it changes the information, if you doesn’t matter I can turn my page I don’t know I don’t see turning<br>凯：好，这个是你的杯子 ，做什么呢？将杯子分成3部分，3层 ，最下面是你饮用的杯子的开口，这一边，这里是你的头 （最上层），中间一层是你的肺部以及心脏 （中间一层），这一边是你的胃部以及腿部 ，这里某些部分是你的手臂 （中间层两边各两撇），这里末端是你的腿部 （最下层两边各两撇），所以你的头部在上面，你能创造你的医疗包，你知道使用医疗包的方式，你将包放在你的身体上，甘斯包，你可以制作更多的甘斯包，然后你可以决定你想要大脑的哪一部分 （最上层两边各两个小圈），然后你决定你想要影响哪里，如这里是你的肝脏或者肾 （中间的小圈），或者你只要处理肝脏上的一个肿块，或者你想要治疗左肺部或者右肺部，或者你想要在对心脏动手术 ，这里，在里面，重要的是肝脏与肾 ，即使肝脏与肾只是处在边上，你需要做的是，你把肝脏与肾，还有其他所有东西，如果这是子宫或者前列腺 （中间的大圆圈），然后你将杯子倒立过来，在某种程度上，我能够做的话，我要换一张图，当它倒立过来，当你从中喝水时 （从下到上的一条线），大多数能量是这一部分 （最上层的大圆圈），你不需要那里那么多的能量，当你从杯子饮用的时候，用一个吸管放入杯子中与你身体生病的部位所对应的位置上，如果你的肺部有毛病，你就一直＆这里 （05:30:15）（上面的一个大圈），然后水流下来改变这里的信息 （左边的竖线），如果你，没关系，我们可以转动页面，我不知道，我看不到转动的按钮<br>[Rick]: I think you can Mr. Keshe with the tools you have to select your home image and then there is a rotate function there it looks like<br>瑞克：我认为你可以，凯史先生，在工具栏，你要选择你的主页面，有一个旋转的功能，看起来就像<br>[somebody]: It say rotate there on the top left, next to the select there is a<br>某人：它上面标明旋转，在顶部的左边，在选择按钮的旁边，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah, okay but I am rotated too far out now okay so now we are right so what you do you put your cup you stay here you want to do with your heart depends with if it’s your left lung of right lung if it’s your dealing with right hemisphere of your body and then you treat you cup like your own body and can drink from where you have the pain but you go on drinking and going down because the nerve information goes to the brain a lot of times we have emotional problem I asked people to drink from the bottom directly and then you close the top you breath from same and depend where your problems is your breathe from that so the cup which was always  said  when you I showed you I opened the cup in one of the tried teaching in the foundation and I always said that if you can control the head which is this part you don’t need you need the body you can carry a man in space just using his brain because wherever you go through the structure of emotion and physicality you can create the body according to the environment you arrive in and I had a very funny thing that somebody told the people in the red circle he wants to behead people like they do in Syria he is a terrorist, this show how terrorist these people this brought this memory that these they are not this with the red circle has to 3 of these cups that why he can right so much he was paralyzed in the left hand just using these cups I fed my own enemy with my own technology and every time he drank it every time he pressed he said thank you Keshe for giving me life back and now this is how it works.<br>凯：是，我找到了，但我旋转的太远了，现在好了 ，所以你把吸管放在这里 ，你想要对你的心脏进行治愈，取决于这是你的右肺还是你的左肺 ，如果你处理的是身体的右边，然后你将杯子作为你的身体，然后你就从你身上有疼痛的位置饮水，一直饮用，并向下移，因为神经信息传导到大脑 （右边的竖线），当人们有情感问题，我就要求人们直接饮用杯底的水 ，你关闭杯口，呼吸，也是一样的， （上面红线），取决于你的呼吸哪里有问题，我总在说这个杯子，我在基金会的教学里给你们展示过打开杯子，我总说，如果你能够控制这个头部，也就是这一部分 （下面的红色方框），你就不需要身体，你携带一个人在太空旅行，只需要用他的大脑，无论你去哪里，通过这个情感的结构 （中间的红圈），以及身体部分 （上面部分），你就可以根据你在太空中所达到的星际点或星球上的环境创造出一个与环境相符合的身体出来。有一个有趣的事情，有人告诉红圈的人说他想要进行斩首就像恐怖分子在叙利亚做的一样，这显示出恐怖分子如何把人们的回忆勾引出来，这些在红圈的人有3个杯子，这就是他们这么右进，他们的左臂瘫痪了。使用这些杯子，我用我的科技供养我的敌人，每一次他饮用，握着这个瓶子，都要说：谢谢你，凯史先生，你让我的生命重新回来。这就是它的运作方式。<br>[somebody]: Mr. Keshe you showed initial with magnets is there any way to patch this<br>某人：凯史先生，你展示了用磁铁，有什么方法让它成为包的一部分吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes you can do it with magnets but if you do magnets are usually used circular magnet you have the way I have always done nobody sees I imbed the gans inside it when you glue it you put a patch on and then you use a hot glue and this is what I use and then it’s the same thing but the patches are not this way you can control of direction why I use magnets is because I can control direction because you got to understand magnets has both north and south if I have a body a cup and I want to increase energy let’s say you have a cancer you have a cancer in your right lung okay.<br>凯：是的，你可以用磁铁做，但如果你用磁铁，磁铁通常是使用环形磁铁 ，我总这样做，但没人看家，我将甘斯嵌入里面 （中心黑点），你用上胶，将包放上面，然后你用上热胶 ，但这个包裹不是，这个方法你能够控制方向，我使用磁铁的原因是，我能够控制方向，你要明白磁铁有北极与南极 ，如果我有一个身体，一个杯子 （左边），我想要增加能量，比如你有癌症，你在你的右肺有癌症 （圆圈），<br>Cancer means extra energy what do I need to do I need to take the energy not give the energy to increase it so what you do taking energy means you to has to face 2 south poles because the energy comes and it goes into south pole so you put your magnet and you put your gans at the centre and you place it here but I need to take energy from this so here is my south pole this is my north and then you do the same here you put the south pole and to the north pole so if you can correctly diagnose it in the right place this too will drain energy from this so you see the reduction in cancer. If you suffer from, save on this, I said don’t save its gone doesn’t matter. If I can go backward no I can’t so let’s say if you have the biology you need energy what is the energy means transfer all you have in your psychological and then you have pains everywhere so adding 2 it mean to feed it this is the brain in 2 halves of it and then you put your north on this side because north is where the energy goes and south when it is there and you put the gans of zinc and CO2 only and then you want to do the same thing with here and then you want to for example it’s the arms which is paralysed<br>凯：癌症就意味着有多余的能量，我需要做什么，我需要将这些多余的能量拿走，而不是给予或者它的能量，怎么做，拿走能量就意味着你要面对2个南极，因为这个能量出来进入到南极，所以你放上磁铁 （右边方块），你把甘斯放在中心，在这里 （中心黑点），但我需要拿走这个能量，所以这里是我的南极，这里是我的北极 （S=南极，N=北极），然后你在这里做一样的事情，放上南极与北极 （左边），如果你能正确诊断癌症的正确位置，磁铁就会汲取这个癌症的能量使它耗竭 ，你就会看见癌症的消减 。如果你遭受，我保存这个页面，没有保存成功，算了没关系。如果我能够返回，也不能。如果你感受生理上耗竭的症状，你就需要能量，什么是能量，能量意味着传输你的心理上所有的能量，能量没有了，你就到处感受到疼痛 ，所以加上2个就意味着供养它，这是大脑 ，这是大脑的两边 ，然后你将北极放在这边 ，因为北极是能量出来的地方，南极在这里 ，然后你在这里放上锌甘斯以及CO2甘斯，只是这两种 （黑点），然后你在这边做同样的事情 ，然后你想要，比如这一边手臂是瘫痪的 （对应大脑）</p>
<p>so you want to feed the are you don’t wat to go anywhere you feed this here and then you put a unit here on the same way you can explicitly target each area of the body that why you see when I cups they are in different sizes and shapes I decide with the strength of the magnet with the gans I put in if I want to target very direct I use a very small magnet when I want to cover a big area u use a big magnet and when I want literally hammer something I use the solid disc magnet if there is a genetic defect you use rectangular hang magnets very very rarely because you have to know what you are using it for because now you transfer copy to copy this, this is very spicksit takes long time to understand then you can direct and transfer your energy of here and you build it to come to the brain so you follow use rectangular magnets and decide and then it takes shape you go from one side of the brain to the side you want to go so you make direction in your, what you call it in your cup and you will find if tis an emotion because you got there with the gans inside it this is a technique I used for years and that why we see and now you can do it you know about the ganses and how you uses but magnets directions it you focus it like bullet it, very big magnet you use with the big whole if you use a very big solid magnet you want to cover your whole stomach you can put so many you use very big magnets and you your gans underneath and you pressurize it.<br>凯：所以你想要供给手臂，你想要到处走，你要供养这里 (右下角方块），你也可以在这里放一个单元装置，可以准确的定位身体的每个部分 （最下面方块表示单元装置，定位大脑，大脑连接身体），这就是为什么我做的杯子有不同形状与大小，我用嵌入有甘斯的磁铁的强度来决定 （右上方方块），如果我想要直接的定位，我就用一个很小的磁铁 （上面小方块），如果我想要覆盖一个很大的区域，我就用一个比较大的磁铁 （上面大方块），如果我想要把事情一下搞定，我就用坚固的圆盘磁铁。如果有遗传缺陷，使用矩形磁铁 （左上方），很少见很少见的，因为你要知道你用来做什么，因为你是在转移复制到一个复制 ，这是很特殊的，需要很长时间，你可以直接把能量转移到这里 （右上角的小圈），然后你建造了这个场体传输到大脑 （中间的竖长方形），所以你接下来在一边使用矩形磁铁，也会成形 （左边长形块，传递到左脑），你将大脑的一边到你想要的另一边，在你的杯子里，你来决定方向 （左脑连线到右上方长块上的小圈），这是情感上的，因为甘斯在里面 ，这是我使用多年的技术，我们看见了，你可以做，你知道甘斯是什么，怎样使用甘斯，但磁铁的方向你集中起来就像子弹，很大的磁铁，如果你使用很大的一块固体磁铁，你想要覆盖你的胃部 （左边长形方块），可以放上这样的磁铁，2个这样的磁铁，一边一个，将甘斯放在下面，并施加压力 。</p>
<p>Those of you who are in Germany who write keep on writing to the others in Belgium to do this and to that he is doing that send this to them and say the cups you got in what you SEK nuclear centre finding nuclear material this now the knowledge is open I hope when you get the cancer you remember where you can yes we will help you. So you understand this, this is why they try to kill us in finding how to reverse cancer so easily and they pay a lot millions to the people who plan killing in the towers of the Antwerp and they still we gave them a hand as they used the hand to write all these rubbish on the internet they are the spies they paid they must have the wrong children. Okay you brought a lot of memories back now you understand what these cups are this is the cup you have understand what you are doing now when you put your copper like this around it with the bottom open this is what you have created it’s here. Let me put a pen on it. Here at the bottom you don’t have, I made the mistake here sorry let me show you what it is. Here at the bottom you haven’t of a copper coating your copper you showed us is here anthem at the bottom her you have created gans here you gans sits here, need a thicker one and your gans sits here so when you push it down it not so much that the gans goes you already have introduced the energy of the gans, and from bottom but the gans going up on the sides you bring it more balanced field but in fact here it more powerful that the bottom when you mix the other things in it if you can sectionise it you can feed the arm the leg and whatever you need or use patches on it and it can do the same. Any other thing?<br>凯：你们中在德国的人一直在给比利时的其他家伙写信，做这些杯子，送给他们，就说这些杯子就如原子能中心发现原子核材料一样，现在知识是开放的，我希望当你得了癌症，你还记得这些能够帮助你。所以你要理解，这就是他们为什么想要杀死我们，就因为我们发现了能够如此简单的逆转癌症，在安特卫普的有权势的那些人支付了大量的钱雇佣人来进行暗杀，我们3和平之手，他们却利用来在网上写这些无聊的废话，他们是间谍，是被支付报酬的，他们甚至利用孩子。好了，你带来了很多的回忆，现在你们知道了这些杯子是什么，这是你的杯子 ，理解你正在做的事情，当你放入一个铜片环绕你的杯底 ，这是你所创造的，我用一个画笔，在这个底部，你没有，我犯了一个错误，抱歉，让我展示这是什么， ，这是你的纳米铜片，在底部你创造出甘斯，这里是你的甘斯 （黄色波浪），当你推压下去，没有更多的甘斯上去 ，你已经将甘斯的能量从底部引上去了 （讲的道格拉斯那一段），但甘斯在这一边向上运动中会带来更多平衡的场 （左边黄色竖线），事实上这个底部是更为强大的 ，当你混入其他的东西，如果你可以分区 （鼠标），你就可以给手臂，腿部或者其他你需要的供能，或者将包放在上面，你也可以做同样的事情，还有其他事情吗？<br>[Rick]: Mr. Keshe I just wanted to briefly show you the one of the question on using the logos on the I think I that will be appropriate now so will do a screen share.<br>瑞克：我想要简单的向你展示一下这个在杯子上使用LOGO的问题，现在或许合适，我来分享屏幕<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I have withdrawn you can go ahead<br>凯：我退出，你可以继续<br>[Rick]; This is from Lion Zhang he is making these health cups and giving them out for free and he want to know if he can use the 2 logos on the cup that would be the KFSSI<br>瑞：这个是来自Lion Zhang的 ，他做了这些健康杯，然后免费分发出去，他想要知道是否可以使用这杯子上2个LOGO，是KFSSI的LOGO<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We have seen only Chinese are doing this and I have seen in Philippine unless you don’t receive a permission from us do not do it because there are a lot things happening in the coming  time that we will explain to you why not and you send the thing to us we give a certification as a right which you can use it if you giving it free we give it  to you feel too because it your it’s not our it’s just protecting we seen other people who set up selling thing on the internet especially in china and people are saying if you donate we give you this and all the donation goes we seen them act in Switzerland people selling power units as a very high price through their bank accounts they are agents their distributing these good but soon we give you all the distribution anybody who gives unit free the what you call it the permission to do it that we protect those that are fake and be mutual and will it break because you will catting a barcode a specific number that is shows it you that you can track where it comes from there are reasons for it because we see especially going out to deliver damage and we have to stop it to safe guard the, the Keshe foundation supporters worldwide. In a short time coming we will be in china and we stay there like once we establish the Dubai here and we stay in china till we raise the Keshe foundation china to where it should be but then we will see where we going to go and how we carry on with the things but we thank the Chinese community of the huge support especially people in the centre who are doing the teachings freely to the public.<br>凯：我们看见只有中国人这样做，我更乐意看见菲律宾这样使用，如果没有得到我们的允许，就不要这样做，因为在未来会发生很多的事情，我会告诉你为什么不能，你给我们发一个这样的东西，我们给你资格认证作为权利，这样你可以使用，如果你是免费发，我们也是免费，因为这是你的，不是我们的，我们只是在保护，我们看见其他人制作东西发到网上卖尤其是中国，人们在说如果你捐款我们给你这个，然后所有捐款不见了，我们看见瑞士人以很高的价格卖能量单元，通过他们自己的银行账户，你们是代理，你可以做分销，但很快我们会给你所有能够免费分发单元的分布网，是在允许的情况下。我们可以保护那些拿到那些假的或者有问题的产生破坏的消费者，你们会被分配一个条形码，一个特殊的表明你的身份的号码，这样我们就能追踪这些产品的出处，这样做是有原因的，因为我们看见尤其一些人发送一些损坏的产品，我要阻止这些事情为全世界的凯史基金会的支持者加强安全防护。在不久的将来，我会在中国，希望如此，一旦迪拜这里的会议筹备好，我会去中国，我会呆在中国直到中国凯史基金筹备好，然后我们会看见我们将去哪里，以及如何准备进行这些事情，我感谢中国社区的巨大支持，尤其是在中心的人们免费的给公众进行教学。<br>[Rick]: They are not the only one with things Mr. Keshe there was the video about eh winding of coils but maybe we could put that that’s about 5 minutes from JF but you probably wanted to describe that in more detail should we put that forward to Tuesday or something?<br>瑞克：还有一件事，凯史先生，关于线圈的缠绕，或许我们可以看看来自JF5分钟的视屏，可能你想要更详细的描述一下，或者我们把它放在星期二？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I don’t know, oh yes we need that today<br>凯：我不知道，哦，我需要在今天<br>[Rick]: Okay so we want to see the video there is also a couple of pdfs about the details of it but we can show the video.<br>瑞克：好的，我们看看这个视屏，里面还有一些更为细节化的PDF，我们可以展示这个视屏<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You can do it let us know because we have international, from today more or less I think Vince can put it in the shop you can but a winding machine which does the nano coating at the same time computerized built by the Keshe foundation part of financing by Jeff Depont which we agreed at 50% holding by the Keshe foundation and this machine will be it’s in the market I think it can only make about a couple of them a week and all the weight and size and measurements is in hand of Vince I think by now it should be and the video where you produce any sides any shape you can program your own winding machine and nano coating so you don’t have to worry how to wind or whatever the machines is fully automised you can make as many coating as you like you can make how to coat it more or less should be perfect for this some teaching problem but overall it’s there to support you this is the machine. The first winding nano coating Magrav machine.<br>凯：你可以做，让我们知道，因为我们具有国际化，从今天开始，差不多，我认为文斯可以放在商店里，你可以买绕线机，同时可以电脑化纳米涂层，这是由杰夫-狄庞部分出资，我们同意凯史基金会拥有50%的份额，这个机器在售卖中，我认为一个星期只能做几个这样的机器，重量，尺寸以及测量是由文斯负责，应该在视屏里，你可以通过机器生产任何一边以及任何形状，你可以给你的绕线机以及纳米涂层编程，所以你不需要如何缠绕，机器是全自动的，你可以根据自己的喜好做多少涂层，你可以决定如何涂层，差不多这应该是完美的，但总的来说，它只是支持你，只是机器。第一个绕线-纳米涂层磁引力场机器。<br>The one on the left is the winding and the one the side with 2 nozzles these are the nano coating systems. Everything is made in the space you don’t need to reopen it to rewind it the system is design to meet what we need and what can be done and adjusted. Makes about 1 coil of in an area of 40 seconds so you make you decide what you want to make the gap you want to make, You can make about 120 coil in a 8 hour shift this mainly for mass production so on a 3 shift you     make about 360 units per machine and if you want to make 3000 you need 10 of them and the price is 7500Euro its literally very cheap this is the computer side it’s all been built its handmade and you can see who ti does everything and when you coil it you can see the nano coating with precision and.  It would have been nice if he would have spoken, so you see the 2 sets is complete and if you are a manufacturer you can use Mach 3 pc or laptop programming as we said from the beginning we support everything even if you want to buy mass copper we can still be provide from the Iranian copper industry and the rest which you cannot buy in the market.<br>凯：左边的是缠绕机器，另一边是2个喷嘴，是纳米涂层系统，  （每秒4转，线圈长度最大800mm) (能够运行在一个汽车电池上，使用逆变器）， （也能生产笔的线圈），每件事情都在这个机器上做好，你不需要重新打开缠绕， （或者生产其他的线圈，通过更换轴，改变运行程序），这个系统设计成满足我们的需要，根据需要调整， (线的直径最大16mm，最小0.8mm)， ， （11秒完成一个笔线圈，18转），制作一个线圈最多也是40多秒，所以你来决定你想要的间距， （每小时完成327个笔线圈，18转）， （每45秒一个144转的线圈）， （每小时79个144转的线圈），你可以在一个8小时的轮换中制作好120个线圈，这是为大规模生产做的准备，所以在3个这个的转换中，你可以每个机器制作360单元，如果你想要生产3000个，你需要10个这样的机器，花费7500欧元，这实际上是很便宜的， （使用Mach3 CNC 软件，用一个计算机或笔记本作为控制器），这是电脑，所有都建造好了， ，这是手工的，你能看见它是如何做好的， ， （双喷嘴纳米涂层系统）， （最大速度：每秒150mm)，这个纳米涂层系统是精密设计的， （燃烧器的作用区域：900MMx400MM), (燃烧器之间的最大距离：100MM）， ， （通过使用持续的速度与温度，可以实现高质量与可重复性的纳米涂层）， （作为缠绕机，通过逆变器同样可以运行在一个汽车电池上），如果他能够讲一下会更好， ，所以这2件套已经完成了，如果你是生产商，你可以使用Mac3PC或者笔记本进行程序控制， （或许适用于不同的燃烧器喷嘴），我们说过从最开始我们就可以支持你所有的事情，如果你想要买大量的铜，我们可以从意大利铜工业那里为你提供，其他的你可以在市场上购买。 (用丙烷测试）。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So we are setting things up for manufacturing as much as everything else. This is for making the capacitors or the coils for he pens. The beauty of it is you can use a car battery to run it in the places there is electricity the machine can use a car battery. Thank you very much Jeff this is a beautiful job what you done. If it goes on the gans when you make gans from gans coating and everything else which is need to dry it.<br>凯：所以我们为生产商尽可能设置好了所有的事情， ，这个是为线圈或者笔制作电容，这里的美妙之处是你可以使用一个汽车电池运行， （这些系统正在持续的改善，所以你所购买的产品可能是升级过的），这是使用电力，这个系统可以用汽车电池， （更多的配件与系统可以选择：为缠绕机配备的自动切割器，为末端线连接用的迷你线圈缠绕机，甘斯应用系统，为水系统中管子准备的线圈缠绕机）， （用作末端线圈连接的迷你线圈）， ， 。 （用冷碱对铝进行纳米涂层）， 很感谢，杰夫，你做的很漂亮， （涂在线圈上的甘斯应用系统）， ，这是对线圈进行甘斯涂层，所有东西都要干燥。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So you can places you order and as we said there is a production in about 2 a week and we so we tell according to where the delivery will be as you order. Is Jeff in the background?<br>凯：所以你可以订购，就像我们说的，在1到2个星期内会开始生产，所以我们根据你的订单要派送的地方来进行相应的工作。杰夫在线吗？<br>[Rick]: yeah I think he is I there.<br>瑞克：是，我认为他在那里<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think he is asleep or he is working late you can go, have you put cell point on the website for the coil? Eugene, Vince? Yes it’s going to be box export port point its Canada you have to pay for the shipping and the rice and what it for import taxes is your duty and it gets shared by we organise by Ela from Italy and this is how it’s going to be the next for us is that the technical, stop it’s the box of it no no go down please the other way the please it says system dimension 1000 by 400 by 300 length maximum 800 coils and with 2mm and everything else is in there electrical control supply 120 to 400 can run on car battery inside invertor can run on a PC using Mach3 or CNC control machine  Program so see everything is there and we slowly covering all aspect of the technology within the Keshe foundation and provide people who these kinds of things we made a path I asked for this to start he is done a beautiful job when you see this it’s taken nearly 4 months to make it and this what we said in time this technology will create more jobs than man could never imagine.<br>凯：我认为他睡了，他工作比较晚，你能把这个单元放在网站上，这个线圈机器，文斯？是的，通过港口海运，进口税是你们的责任，由艾拉组织的，从意大利， ，这是为我们准备的，这是技术上的，停下，停下 ，这个盒子，不，下面，那一边，机器的尺寸是1100MMx400MMx300MM，线圈长度最大800MM，内线圈直径最小2MM，最大15MM，所有的东西都在上面 ，电力供应是120/240,输出电压是400W，使用逆变器可以运行在汽车电池上，使用Mac3软件作为CNC控制器运行在PC上，所以你看见所有的东西都在那里，我们慢慢涵盖这个技术的所有方面 ，在凯史基金会的范围内我们让人们可以做这些事情，我们开辟了一条道路，他做的很漂亮，你可以看到这是花了4个月才做好的，这就是我们所说的，迟早这个技术会创造出更多的工作，超出我们的想象。<br>And we see it now by the way I have to congratulate the Keshe foundation manufacturing Italy what you have achieved yesterday Keshe foundation manufacturing as of yesterday agreement had been reached we move in 6000 square meter factory in nor to Italy changing location we were expecting now its final as of yesterday and I am sure the factory will put out employment list that we will like to employ people with the Keshe foundation knowledge in nano coating that when we are going to work  you have a job the job is specifically for Italians I mention again the job the factory work is specifically at the moment for Italians if you are an Italian looking for a job and you are avoid nano coating get in touch with the Giovani in the Keshe foundation Italy , Italy.it and we will be organises for you to be interview by the factory its own, this is the Italian direction owned 51% by us and the rest is the but the Italian investors who stat the factory with us we have our manager have taken over early this month so we are going into a full production employing large number of people in Italy and think Germans will follow us very soon and I am financing the same for Japan Keshe foundation Japan as a manufacturing will come into production very soon. What is important and we cannot forget is to thank people who are in the background doing so much work.<br>凯：同时我要恭喜意大利凯史基金会在昨天所取得的成果，昨天达成协议，会在意大利北部形成一个达到6000平米的工厂，我们期望改变位置点，昨天最后达成，我很肯定，会实施就业的目标，我们会雇佣具有凯史基金会的人们，在纳米涂层方面，当你去找工作，你就有工作，这个工作是为意大利人准备的，我再提一遍，这个目前的工作，工厂的工作是为意大利人准备的，如果你是意大利人，知道怎么纳米涂层，请联系意大利凯史基金会的朱万尼，会为你安排在工厂的面试，这是意大利方向的，我们拥有51%的份额，剩下的是意大利开办工厂的与我们进行合作的投资者，这个月初我们有经理人负责接管，所以它会进行全面的生产，在意大利雇佣大量的人，德国人会很快赶上，我也对日本进行了投资，日本凯史基金会作为一个生产商会很快投入生产中，重要的是，我们不能忘记在幕后上付出了这么工作的人们。<br>I thank the Italian community especially  Giovani and the Italian community in the south of Italy and north of Italy the right support of us and support of Keshe foundation please remember from first of march we open a plug on all the channels KFSSI the spaceship institute and the keshe foundation.org on the section of the teaching you can sign in and register yourself to become a student in Italian and English at minimum donation of 100Euro we give you up option you think how much this knowledge is worth and you want to be part of it to learn and you will be allowed to join the Keshe foundation teaching direction not any 500 Euro anymore 100Eurp minimum those who cannot afford can pay that those of you who want to have on the cheapest you receive on the cheapest but as promise we bring the technology and teaching and the reach of every man on this planet we say in out teaching yesterday we had gentleman whose who loved to do the technology from African nation whose used the free access to teaching and now he sits with the students like everybody else and he can teach you some nation and national in the community so as we promised we hopefully by the first of March or sometimes in march we will have 100 donation for the Chinese language teaching too.<br>凯：我感谢意大利社区，尤其是朱万尼，意大利南部社区以及北部的支持者,请记住，从三月开始，我们开通了所有的通道，KFSSI，太空飞船机构，the keshe foundation.org，在教学的部分，你可以注册成为一名意大利的学生，以及英语教学，最低10欧元，我们给你选择，你来认为这个知识有多值，你来决定你想要成为其中一部分，你被允许加入凯史基金会教学部分，不再是500欧元，最低100欧元，那些付不起的人也能够支付，那些想要最便宜的，就给你最便宜的，但就如我们说的，我们为星球上每个人带来技术与教学，我们愿意将知识传达给每个人，在我们昨天的教学中我们有一位绅士，他喜爱做这个科技，他来自非洲国家，他通过免费的途径进入到教学中，现在他像其他人一阿姨那个与学生坐在一起，你能够为你的国家和民族进行教学，所以就如我们承诺的，我们希望在三月初或者在三月某个时候我们能够设置100欧元的费用开始中文的教学。<br>China.keshefoundation.org will come into operation that if you are Chinese anywhere in the world you can make a contribution or 100 Euro or whatever you like you see appropriate about that and you start being a student at Keshefoundation institute as a student and if you go the way we see after the opening on the 21st of and 22nd of April if we see the situation perfect we will make and start the move in respect to the teaching the teaching still stay open and free to the African nation and with it we add in certain places like south America and part of India that access and teaching should be free to these nations because we are in those positions. We leave it on the donation free unless you click I need to be free I can’t afford it then you if on you own trust we give you option do you want to donate or do you want to it free because I can’t afford then you have to be honest with yourself. Who will be with you to make a donation so you are keep on to what we said and we are keeping to out work what we kept that we will bring the teaching access to everyone and we all have seen today we are a truly international organisation we hear from Africa from Benjamin we heard from our friend in the united stated we heard from Philippine we heard from Chile and we heard from Germany and other part of the world Keshe foundation has become truly one family one nation.<br>凯：China.keshefoundation.org将会进入运行中，如果你是世界上无论哪里的中国人，你可以捐款100欧元或者其他你喜欢的觉得合适的数目，你就可以开始成为凯史基金会学院的一名学生。在4月21号与22号后，如果情况良好，在教学方面，对非洲国家仍然是公开与免费的，我们会增加一些地区如南美以及印度，这些地区将是免费的教学，因为这些国家处在这样的位置上。我们让捐款自愿，除非你表明我需要免费，我支付不起，你按照自己的良心做，我们给出选择，你想要捐款或者想要免费，你自己决定，你对你自己诚实，对自己负责。任何人都可以捐款，所以你保持我们所说的，我们保持我们所要保持的工作，我们让每个人接触到教学，今天我们看到这样的趋势，我们是一个国际性的组织，我们有来自非洲的本杰明，来自美国的朋友，还有来自菲律宾，来自智利，来自德国，以及世界其他地方，凯史基金会已经成为真正的一个家庭，一个国家<br>[Rick]: and Mr. Keshe maybe we can also hear from Keshe foundation Australia who they called you how they have a video here showing the people involved in the new ware house factory in Melbourne I thought maybe we could end with that or we could carry on if there is, if you want to<br>瑞克：凯史先生，我们可以听一下来自澳大利亚凯史基金会的声音，他们有一个视屏，展示人们在墨尔本新仓库的工厂里的情况，我想或许我们可以以这个结束，或者你想要继续，如果你想要<br>[Mr. Keshe]: There is nothing else, show us and then we say good bye we say goodbye to you we will see you over Dubai event 21st 22nd of April we have made arrangements for you to be able to cheap tickets and visa doesn’t belong to it’s the agency which will support you to get your visa and your ticket and as we said the first 500 stays at 500 Euro and after that goes to 750 Euro plus the food which is 150 or you want to join the dinner gala. Make sure from every nation we have somebody on the flow because the nation that we say is the last language every language has to represent because now it’s a combination of language not a nation of borders.

<p>[Rick]: Vince did you have that other video to play? Okay we will do the intro<br>瑞克：文斯，你有其他的视屏要放吗？好，我们开始播放介绍视屏<br>{Intro video} There are people listening from every corner of this planet no knowledge has been spread so beautifully or balanced across the planet ever maybe in the universe you have the full potential of achieving everything in the universe there is no need and there no for man not to achieve so wherever you are the way I taught you make the coils that we design we have continue equal gravitational magnetic field and if you put CO2 and you put zinc on it you have connected the emotion of the man on the stable condition find out you have a very peaceful man. Here we stop having galaxies and the universe goes and creation in magnetical we have used the matter state gravitational magnetic field strength to dominate and dictate the shape of the plasma. The nano technology the nano material which you have collectively developed in different ways by caustic by electric current by whatever fire or whatever has that advantage that the matter the nano is all the same so connection solid it’s very strong. The power of the plasma technology the way we have taught is beyond imagination of the man. Now we create and control the plasma which is the mother of the creation of the universe we are given the seed of the essence of creation. The foundation does not belong to no one and is not made of one anymore. You are developing it you are a structure in it and from today it will be still the same we will still develop the technology in different lanes in different colours in different nationalities in which they do not exist. It is beautiful when we see a Christian a Muslim the Jew and every other belief are working together to build up systems we have already become on faith, we have already have become one nation and we already have become one planet.  We got to remember one thing dates is irrelevant today is the last day of the Christian calendar or tomorrow is the beginning of another, one dates connect to another we don’t stop. We are working around the clock Keshe foundation team is working a respectable time position religion country, and now we keep up the setup. {End of intro video}<br>凯：这个星球的每个角落都有人在听我们授课，知识从来没有像现在这样以如此美妙与平衡的方式在这个星球上传播。在宇宙中你有实现任何事情的全部的潜能，人类完全可以自由实现自己所需，所以无论你在哪里，我教你们制作线圈的方式，我们设计的双线圈的方式，你就能制造平衡的磁引力场，如果你CO2放在上面，把锌片放在上面，你就能与人类的情感相连接，你会发现成为一个很和平的人。现在我们知晓星系与宇宙的运行，在磁力中创造与连接，我们可以使用物质状态下的磁引力场强度来支配与控制等离子体的状态。你们一起以不同的方式在发展这个纳米技术，这个纳米材料，通过烧碱，通过电流，通过火或者其他。这样的优势就是纳米、物质、等离子体之间成为一体，相互的连接是如此坚固，如此强大。我们所教授的等离子体技术展现的力量超出人们的想象。现在我们能创造和控制作为创造宇宙的等离子体，我们被给予了创造元素的种子。基金会不隶属于任何人，不再是由一人组成。你们发展它，你成为结构中的一部分，从今天开始我们能成为一样的，我们仍会在不同的名字、不同的颜色、不同的国度的条件下发展这个技术，但这些都不会存在。这是很美妙的，当我们看见一个穆斯林，一个基督徒，一个犹太人在一起工作，一起建造这个系统，我们已经变得有了同一个信仰，我们已经成为一个国家，我们已经成为一个星球。我们要记住，日期是不相关的，今天是基督教历的最后一天，明天又是另一个开始，一天连着一天，我们不会停止。我们在一起工作，凯史基金会团队是在各自合适的时间，地点，宗教与国家中工作。现在我们实现了我们所设置的目标。<br>[Rick]: Okay that’s such a lovely video, I think we are for Mr. Keshe now Mr. Keshe now are you ready to speak I think we are going to show promotional video as well after that.<br>瑞克：好了，这是一个很让人愉快的视屏。我认为现在可以有请凯史先生讲话了，你准备好了吗，凯史先生，过后，我认为还要再放一个宣传视屏。</p>
