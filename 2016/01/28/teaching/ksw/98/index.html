We don’t …<br>凯：看一下，有一些有趣的东西，看一下，我们将会….<br>[Rick]: We are already broadcasting so let me make the announcement now and go with it after I will try to look at it in the background here. Okay welcome everyone to the 98th knowledge seekers workshop the Keshe foundation Spaceship institute is Thursday, January 28, 2016 and once again we are together here and ready to share from Mr. Keshe at the Keshe foundation spaceship institute, we will have the usual small discussion we will see how that goes but first we will hear from Mr. Keshe. Okay take it away Mr. Keshe.<br>瑞克：我们已经准备好播放了，所以让我宣布一下开始，随后我会在后台看一下的。好的，欢迎来到98次凯史知识探索者教学，今天是2016年1月28日，星期四。我们聚集在此，准备和凯史先生在凯史太空学院分享知识，像往常一样，会有一段小的谈话，我们来看看怎样进行的，但还是先有请凯史先生。好的，凯史先生，请接过去。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Yes good morning good day to you whenever wherever you listen to these workshops as usual, today is no more of a workshop but nothing usually is normal with the teaching at this level. We will come across surprises and at the same time we try to do some teaching adding to the knowledge and learning from the others who teach us new things. In the past 2 days, 3 days with the opening of the blueprint of the health we have seen the radical changes in so many ways in respect to Keshe foundation work, they have realized people who are around that we just don’t go with the energy, energy is irrelevant as I said always is energy but represent of the work of  the foundation the other part is to do with the health and in so many ways now we have seen the health is merging with the what we call energy and with the space and with other aspects of technology.<br>凯：好的，早上好，无论你何时何地像往常一样聆听这些教学，今天不再是研讨会，但在这个层次上的教学没有什么是普通的了。我们发现了很多惊喜，同时我们试着将这些知识变为教学，并且从其他人那些学习更多新的事物与知识。在过去2刀天内，随着医疗蓝图的公开传播，在凯史基金会的工作的各个方面，我们看到一些根本性的改变，周围的一些人意识到我们并不仅仅专注于能量，正如我说，能量是不相干的，但能量单元代表着基金会的工作，另一大的部分是在医疗部分；通过如此多的方式，我们看见医疗正与能量融合在一起，与太空融合在一起，与这项科技的其他方面融合在一起。<br> We try to bring up the next week or two weeks a 3rd public workshop a 3rd blueprint public workshop at this level we go directly into growth and agriculture and decontamination so we complete  the circle for how forward we need to do and in that time we join the section of the spaceship program and from then on it would be virtually hand on I will come back into full operation testing which I have stayed away for a couple of years and when I get involved in space technology development and delivery I always perform so we wait till this part of the work complete that it completes as part of the teachings the energy the health the food the agriculture and in so many ways the decontamination and from then on some beginning of March physically hopefully in the early March of sometime around March April the other person to get involved in developing I will take in the labs showing you, we will show you flight system we delivered the Iranian national governments flight system which we have always have back we bring in direct lifts take offs shielding full shielding system more or less decontamination and the rest. We will show flights on flight board we will come in and we will show everything which is needed to start the development of the spaceship program.<br>凯：我们将会在下个星期或者下两个星期内进行第三次蓝图教学，我们会走向生长、农业和净化领域。于是我们就完成了循环：接下来怎么前进，同时我们加入到太空项目，这样太空项目就可以传递下去了，我们回到我几年都没有参与的整个运作测试中，当我参与到太空技术的发展与我一直在操作的传送当中，我们一直等到这项工作的完成，并作为教学课程中一部分的结束，如能量、医疗、食物、农业以及各种净化。在三月初，三月一些时候或四月，另一个人会参与到发展中来，我们会在实验室展示给你们，我们会展示飞行系统，我们会交付我们一直在背后支持的伊朗国家政府部门的飞行系统，我们会直接展示飞行，起飞，屏蔽，全屏蔽系统，去污以及其他。我们会在飞船上展示飞行，我们会进来，我们会展示所有所需的启动飞船项目的步骤。<br>As noticed in past here I have stayed of the board I have stayed off the lab in showing thing but now we have reached the point that I personally come in. We bring the team together we point the location and in that location which will be the city of Dubai hopefully we will start showing spaceship program in its full operation, this means setup will test will fly we protect and we show the power of the technology. We will perform in one way we will bring from all nationalities during the test so when we achieve when we deliver everything will be the same when we hand on in the Sosana 2 years ago we showed the 129 Tesla power system now we go back in a couple of months to the same position when all the battery units made  on the controls seems to be completed the agriculture is completed the health completed that we are ready show the final that when we in the space we are fully equipped to survive the space.<br>凯：正如你们所注意到的，我一直远离飞船系统与实验室，没有直接参与展示什么，但现在我们达到这样一个程度：我个人参与进来了。我们带着一个团队，我们指向一个地点，就在迪拜，我们会展示飞船项目的全部操作。这意味着将会设置出来，进行测试，进行飞行，我们保护和展示这个技术的力量。我们将会这样运作，将所有民族都带入进这个测试中，于是当我们实现了，当我们交付了，所有都会成为一样。当我们在2年前圣安娜转交装置的时候，我们展示了124、129特斯拉电力系统，现在我们在几个月中又回到原来的位置，当所有制作的处于可控状态的电池单元接近完成，农业就完成了，医疗就完成了，我们准备展示最后阶段，也就是我们在太空中，我们能够完全准备好在太空中生存。<br>A lot of people I have seen have made a lot of comments about the Tuesday presentations especially the later part which was shown in the control of the system by thoughts some people have some restoration on it and we have seen that some people in the background from Entrap Red circle and the Germans have made threatening again against the person who shown they made the life threat against him and he went on the internet and he has put the video, please refrain from these kind of presentation we are here to show integrity we are here to show unification, these people are there to provoke to show that we can be split it’s the same people, they are paid heavily we just been informed this morning of how heavily Belgian government is involved in this kind of work.<br>凯：我看见大量的人对星期二所展示的作了大量的评论，尤其是教学后面部分的与人的意念相连的智能系统，一些人从装置上得到了恢复，我们也看到在安特普红圈和德国的一些人在对这位展示自己装置的人发出威胁，对他做出生命的威胁，他们来到网络上，展示视屏，请不要对受这些视屏的影响。我们在这里展示整体性，我们在这里展示联合与团结，这些人在那里进行挑衅性的展示，我们与他们区分开。就是这些同样一些人，他们被付以很高的报酬，我们尽早得知比利时政府是如何深深的卷入这些事情中。<br>I ask directly do not get intimidated do not take these people who make you threats, these people who make threats against your life that they have any capabilities, these are bunch of coward people who enjoy and they see bank account growing paid by government to stop the process of development of the man’s entirety in science and technology in time we will respond we put this before any court let us do our work. WE have people who are watching and control I ask you again on Tuesday and I repeat again on these chats you on the YouTube, you are on the live stream you are on the zoom. These are fake names used that they control you or they come back to you after the teachings and they mess up your computer do not respond to anybody you do not know. Please do not answer do not open any email which comes to you from anybody you do not know especially they are using proxy servers to damage your computer they are using all sorts of things it’s a huge vast amount of finances has been made available to red circle and Germany group to do these kind of things to interrupt there is no more interruption and weare going very rapidly deliver.<br>凯：我告诉你们不要害怕，不要被这些人的恐吓所影响，这些人对你的生命发出恐吓，没有什么能力，这只是一群儒弱的享受他们由政府支付的账户资金上涨的人，用来阻止人们在科学技术的进程中取得完整与统一，迟早我们会回应，我们把这些放在法庭上，让我们继续做我们的工作。我们知道这些人在观看，在控制，我在星期二再一次要求你们，我继续重复，你们在聊天室里，在YouTube上，在直播间，在视屏空间里。这些是虚假的名字，是他们用来控制你们的，或者在教学结束后联系你并破坏你的电脑，不要向你所不知道的人回复任何信息。不要回答不要打开从你不知道的任何人那里来的邮件，尤其是使用代理服务器用来破坏你的电脑的，他们在使用各种事情，这是一个巨大的金融支持，用来支付给红圈和德国一些团体从而从事这些破坏的活动，不会再有打断和干扰，我们会进行的越来越快。<br>Do not open anyone who gives their email do not open any link they give you to have a look at these are fully paid fledged officers paid by the governments to do these things to bring computers down to threaten people. Be with us stay with the foundation and show whatever you develop this is absolutely important these people just make threats they go in your computer find your loved ones or your friends and they use those to threaten you, they have nothing to deliver. On the other hand I thank those who some come out  and show new technologies. On the other had we have to stay together to change the course these people have had a wild life of running and they think it’s their right. There are paid to this without this they have no breakfast to eat so they do anything they can, respond to them with blessing we see and we know how they operate they have tried to everything possible to sabotage for 10 years they did not let us to go and to show and to deliver and to teach openly till we came out of Belgium. They sat next to us ate with us and poisoned us, they sat with us came to our home and poisoned our children.<br>凯：不要打开任何人寄给你的邮件，不要打开他们发给你的衔接，上面写着：看一下。这是一些被政府雇佣的经验老道的专做这些事情的人，将你的电脑破坏掉，从而威胁人们。与我们在一起，围绕在基金会周围，展示你发展出的技术，这是十分重要的，这些人只是在发出威胁，他们进入你的电脑，找到你的爱人，孩子，朋友的信息，用来威胁你们，他们没有什么来传递与分享的。此外，我感谢那些站出来并分享自己新技术的人，在另一方面，我们必须站在一起来改变这个过程，这些人过一些狂野放荡的生活，并自以为是。他们被付酬劳来做这些事情，没有这些薪水，他们将没有早餐可吃，所以为此他们愿意做一切事情，回应他们最好的办法是为他们祝福。我们知道他们是如何运作的，近10年来他们尽一切可能去破坏，他们就不让我们走，不让我们展示，不让我们传达，不让我们公开教学直到我们离开比利时。他们坐在我们旁边，与我们一起吃，并对我们下毒；他们与我们坐在一起，来到我们房子里，并且毒害我的孩子。<br>These people what we call Red Circle sit in Antwerp they are the highly paid professional people that they only can get paid and now they move into Germany by threatening, they have no teeth and we will show you we know who they are we have whole dimension of their operation. I received calls and emails that people have been threatened and they put videos I watched the videos this is not our job our job is to teach. Do not get frightened, they frightened Alex he went down for a couple of months he came back up and now he has taken over the whole African teaching. The fear they have is that they lost control they lost control that is how they threaten people that’s how they manage to operate for years and now they have lost connection. It is important for the Keshe foundation supporters and those of you who deliver work to make sure at any cost we stay open we show and we change the course it’s the first time ever human race has the power to do so, a number of organization peace organization have approached Keshe foundation to unite with them to establish the world governments in the way.<br>凯：这就是一些位于比利时安特卫普的红圈中的人，他们是被高额支付报酬的专业的人，他们只能靠这样得到报酬，他们靠威胁进入到德国，他们没有牙齿，我们知道他们是谁，我们知道他们运作的整个结构。我收到电话与邮件说人们受到威胁，他们把视屏拿出来，我看着这些视屏，这不是我们的工作，我们的工作是教学。不要受惊吓，他们威胁阿历克斯,他停止了几个月，然后又重新开始，现在他从事整个非洲的教学。他们害怕的是失去控制，然后就威胁他人，这就是他们这几年如何运作的，现在他们已经失去连接了。对于凯世纪会的支持者以及传递自己工作进展的人来说，很重要的是不惜任何代价保持着公开，我们分享展示，我们改变进程，这是第一次人类有能力这样做，很多和平组织找到凯史基金会，表示愿意与我们团结在一起组建世界政府。<br>We choose we will not work with organization like who have governmental support infiltrate and do jobs but with the other organisation will collaborate we will collaborates with the scientific groups we will collaborate with any organization health groups to develop the technology and deliver the technology to humanity the way we done. This is our job its our duty the first time ever in the life of man that the human race themselves without governments have taken course of their own action. We have become and we are one of the most powerful scientific organisations which belongs to humanity is not done in the back doors it hasn’t done in the tables we keep our bank account open that they cannot say we are paid by a government or we are slaves of the others. You support us you do it openly and we share knowledge often with each other. Its you who goes out and teaches, its you who are organising the meetings and teachings and its you who connects the system to your system to your electricity and see the reduction and its you who see your loved ones and the ones you care for are start living free of pain now we show you how to create food how to be able to clean up water and live a clean life.<br>凯：我们会选择，我们不会与那些有政府支持的实际从事渗透工作的组织合作，我们会与那些科学性的组织，会与任何致力于发展这项科技并传播这项技术给人类的健康医疗类的组织合作。这是我们的工作，我们的责任，是第一次在人类生活中不需要政府而通过自己的行动来改变进程。我们已经成为并且是最具力量的科学性组织之一，我们这个组织属于人类，而不是在暗箱操作，也不是通过各方利益协商组建的，我们让账户保持公开，他们就不能说我们是得到政府报酬的，或者说我们是其他什么人的代理人。你支持我们，你公开的做，我们就与每一个人分享知识。是你走出去教学，是你组织教学会议，是你将系统连接到你的系统，你的电网上，看见能源的节省，是你看见你的爱人和你关心的人开始在没有疼痛的环境中生活，我们展示给你们如何创造食物，如何净化水，并且生活在一个洁净的生活中。<br> Keshe foundation has taken the course and world government structure is taking shape. I have asked Almin to head the establishing of the world organisation government in the way. It is our job each one of you as Keshe foundation to support the change. The change that we are free and the money is time is spend goes for development and goes for peace of mankind. You should or you may learn from what we have been through because we are correct we succeed we will explore the space as it says on the screen we will bring peace to space organisation but I warn and I explain to you one thing directly we shall and we have started the universal community the first contacts are getting established and in time collectively human race will be open to the space. We are not dreamers we are delivers but we deliver peace knowledge and unification all we need to do is to stay correct on our path. We approach no government but we change the course of government by correct conduct.<br>凯：凯史基金会正在介入到进程中，世界政府的结构正在成形。（00:15:14）我要求阿曼去领导世界政府组织的筹建，这是我们的工作，你们每一个作为凯史基金会一份子去支持这种改变。这改变是我们是自由的，时间与金钱都被运用在这项科技的发展中以及人类的和平事业中。你应该或者从我们的经历中学到很多，因为我们是正确的，我们成功了，我们会探索太空就像屏幕上写的，我们会把和平带到空间组织，但我直接警示过和解释过一件事，我们将会，我们已经开始筹建宇宙社区，与太空生命的接触和联系正得到完善，迟早人类将会完全面对太空生活。我们不是梦想家，我们是传递者，我们传递和平知识与团结合一，我们所需要做的就是在我们的道路上保持正确的方向与方式。我们没有通过政府，但我们却能通过正确的行动改变政府的进程。<br> Those of you who would like to see the change take the step and teach and work within the frame of the foundation, its not our weakness that we sharing is our strength that we know by sharing we have nothing to lose but to gain. The human race has one choice to become one or in the coming time they will be no human race. In our teaching on Tuesday we have seen new evolution in health, we have seen how simply we can produce systems which can change the plasma of the body of the man and in turn change the structure of the man walking away from cancer walking away from all certain kinds of diseases. We need to explain I was asked to explain why I have chosen the city of Dubai as the headquarters and the centre for the Keshe foundation as a spaceship city as a peace city and as the head centre for the world government. The explanation is very simple in Dubai there are over 180 nationalities working together as work as one nation so we already have a city of one nation.<br>凯：你们如果愿意看到改变，采取行动，按照步骤，在凯史基金会的框架下去教学与工作。我们分享不是我们的弱点，而是我们的力量所在。我们知道通过分享我们没有什么在失去而是在不断得到。人类可以选择成为一个种族或者不再成为人类。在我们星期二的教学中，我们看见医疗方面的新的变革，我们能看见我们能够多么简单的生产能够改变人体等离子体的系统，进而能够改变人体的结构使之远离癌症，远离其他所有的疾病。我们需要去解释，我也被要求去解释，为什么我会选择迪拜这个城市作为总部以及凯史基金会的中心，使其成为一个太空城，一个和平城，同时是世界政府的首都。原因很简单，在迪拜有超过180个民族就像一个整体一个国家在一起工作与运行，我们就有了一个像一个国家一样的城市。<br> The governs of Sidichech Mahammed his Excellency is a fair and just man, he has spent a lot of the nation on his national but collectively has managed to bring all the nations to work together. The city is literally brand new is built on more or less 21st century structure and is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Wealth of the nation is in the hand of the nation and is not stolen from the nation. The city is very active and works on the edge of science it has every international connection to be the centre of the government for the world. I have explained and some of you who do not know might know by now or is you been told before. We choose the world government through the organisation of the Keshe foundation in every country without spending money on elections but those who can serve to bring the change.<br>凯：默罕默德-希第奇阁下是统治长官，是一个公正的正直的人，他将国家的力量大部分用在他自己的酋长国内，但是他能设法将所有酋长国联合在一起运行。这个城市其实是崭新的，差不多在21世界修建好，是世界上最漂亮的城市之一。国家的财富在国家人民身上而不是某些人窃取了国家财富，这个城市很有活力，而且处于科学的前沿，它自身具有各种有利的国际的连接使其具备成为世界政府的资格。我已经解释过，你们中一些不知道的人现在就该知道了，或者你以前已经被告诉过。我们通过各国的凯史基金会选择世界政府的坐落地，我们青睐于那些没有花费金钱在选举上却能自我奉献将自身导入正规并带来改变的国家。<br> We will inforce our work to the technology as soon and as fast as you can setup the Keshe foundation which have received a large number of application for each country then your Keshe foundation in your country becomes the present of the world government in the world city. We do not establish a parallel government with the internal government establishes one government for the whole world. Districts parts will stay the way we are we will not work on national borders we work to the languages we will choose not people from United State but we choose people of the English speaking we will not choose Chinese Keshe foundation as a presentative but the Chinese throughout the world who speak Chinese. This way we get away with the borders. Chinese are in every part of the world so collectively Chinese community will respond represent in the world city.<br>凯：我们会加强在技术上的工作，你们可以尽快的成立凯史基金会，在每个国家我们都收到了大量申请，然后你们的凯史基金会就成为世界政府的代表。我们不建立一个与国际政府相平行的政府，我们只在世界上建立一个政府。各部门以及各部分还是我们原来的样子，我们不是在国家的藩篱里内工作，我们根据语言来工作；我们不是选择来自美国的人而是选择说英语的人；我们不是选择中国凯史基金会的人作为代表而是选择在全世界说汉语的人。通过这种方式我们可以远离隔离与屏障，汉语在世界的各个地方，所以中国社区将会在世界城市中具有代表性。<br>The same will be the Spanish and the French. This way we become citizens of one world. This way we get rid of borders man made lines for those of use and name. Keshe foundation manufacturing will operate on the same manner the outcome the profit or the residue will be spent across the nation not in one nation, if you are a Spanish speaking you live in South America you still considered as part of the Spanish world  or whole of South America becomes part of one part as part of the Keshe foundation world community. This way we get away with borders from now on borders don’t exist we speak through one language we speak through one nation we speak through as one family who have different beauties and attributes in being a family this way when we go to space I’m English speaking but I am from the human race Chinese speaking but I am from the human race we don’t belong to somewhere else. This is how we make one nation one government. Keshe foundation world government be seated in Dubai will behave and act as one race.<br>凯：西班牙语和法语也一样。通过这个方式我们成为世界的公民。通过这种方式我们去除了界限与藩篱，人们通过语言与名字制造各种界限与分离。凯史基金会工厂也将以同样的方式运作，工厂的产出，利润，以及剩余将会用在世界范围内而不是某一个国家内，如果你是一位西班牙语者，住在南美，你仍在认为自己是西班牙世界的一部分，而整个南美成为了凯史基金会的一部分中的一部分的部分。通过这样的方式我们远离界限，从现在开始界限不再存在，我们讲同一语言，我们在同一个国家中说话，我们在同一个家庭中说话，这个家庭有不同的美妙与贡献，因这些不同而使其成为一个家庭。通过这样方式，我们来到太空后，我是讲英语的，但我来自人类；我是讲汉语的，但我来自人类。我们不属于其他地方。这就是我们怎样成为一个国家一个政府的。位于迪拜的凯史基金会也会像一个种族一样运作。<br>When you elect a person to be your representative you choose from any nation which you come from but on the language of that where you came from your mother language. If there is a few thousand people speaking a language but still we represent it on the world government as will do the others. We do not have the size of the sea that there is some where seats allocated to one nation or language but is one person, one person only per language spoken. This way there are no borders if you leave any part of the world you speak the mother language in another part of the world you still part of the same family. We done with borders and you cause we announcehow many howwe cover the taxation to cover for the expenses of the people in different nationalities. Dubai is where we find correct conduct and correct leadership it has nothing to do with the religion is not the loss to the Europeans that move to the Emirates or to the Arab speaking nation of the Islamic world to us there is no religion. We spent 15 years spreading the knowledge among the Christians world but the Chinese learned so did the Arabs so did the Africans and the rest now we moved into Middle East to complete the promise of the past to complete the process of the peace.<br>凯：当你选举一个人作为你的代表，你是选举与你同一个国的任何人，但却都是说同一个母语，如果只有几千人讲一个语言，我们仍会在世界政府中给他们代表权就像与其他社区人群一样。我们没有海一样的大小将一些作为分配给同一个国家或说同一种语言的人，但是可以一个人对应一个语言。通过这样方式就没有界限与藩篱，如果你离开世界的其他地方，但你仍在说世界其他地方的母语，你仍然是这个相同家庭的一部分。我们结束了界限与分别，我们会宣布我们为多少个种族而取消了赋税，取消了不同民族的各种负担。迪拜是我们找到的有着正确导向与行动，有着正确领导结构的地方，它无关于宗教，而这正是一些移居到酋长国或者阿拉伯语国家或者伊斯兰国家的欧洲人所缺失的，而对我们来说没有宗教。我们花了15年在基督教世界传播知识，但中国人学会了，阿拉伯人学会了，非洲人学会了，以及世界其他地区人学会了。现在我们搬到中东以完成我们过去所做的承诺，即实现和平的进程。<br>To me is irrelevant if you believe in any part of God through whatever name that is profitable for different offices and different names. There are no religions in space except the path of belief in being correct in the correct conduct. There are no churches no mosques no synagogues no temples. The temple of God has to be in your heart and in your soul, emotion and then you find out you are part of the old religions of the world what you like and then you find out you like to believe in one creator and this is the way universal community works to serve to be there and not to interfere. We will not and will not take part in being and repeating what is being done in the past to make same mistakes those who become the representative to Keshe foundation are not allowed to announce themselves to be what they stand for they have to be elected by the people through the love of the people.<br>凯：对我来说是不相关的，如果你相信任何地方的神，无论是什么名字，而这些不同的名字能为不同的官员和不同的名称获取利益，在太空中没有宗教除了相信正确的行为与导向。没有清真寺，没有寺庙，没有犹太教堂。神的庙宇在你的心中，在你的灵魂中，在你的情感中，然后你会发现你是世界上旧有宗教的一部分，无论你喜欢什么，你就会发现你相信一个神，这就是宇宙社区的工作方式：去服务，而不是去干扰。我们不会成为和重复过去已经做的会造成错误的方式，那些成为凯史基金会的代表不被允许宣布自己成为他们自己所代表的，而是通过人们爱的选择。<br>In so many ways we do not order to be a member but we are given the love of the society of serve. Dubai city as a space ship centre will fill the first spaceship flights directly from Dubai. Be make sure Dubai becomes June in the ground of humanity. In respect to sharing of the knowledge we share equally the way we have done. Please understand one thing share the knowledge and teach as much as you can and when there is a need and there is a shortage and you need something to teach the technology the Keshe foundation will support you. We done that with Africa and now we see people like Mike Nasser and Tom Salus moving into Hawaii to teach the Hawaiians how to use the technology for themselves in a coming time we organise as we have the discussed the rescue teams where we stand by to deliver not whatever is done but deliver the systems technologies that people can afford or whatever at the point of disaster. This was discussed in yesterday teachings this is what we will deliver we are looking for people to start developing making the pain pads the pain pens everything else to be understand by to be the Keshe foundation will finance it.<br>凯：我们不应只是社会的一个零件或成员，我们有爱的能力，并能通过这个能力服务他人。迪拜将会成为第一个完成太空飞船项目的城市，我们在6月会确保迪拜成为人类的基地。这些知识我们都会一如既往的平等的分享。请理解一件事情，尽你们可能分享知识与教学，如果你们有需求或者不足，比如你们需要什么来进行传播这项科技，凯史基金会会支持你们。我们在非洲就是这样做的，现在我们看见像迈克-纳赛尔与托马斯-塞勒斯进驻到夏威夷，教导那里的人使用这项科技，在接下来，就像我们讨论的我们会组织建立在传送系统的基础上的救援队，通过传送给人们支付得起的系统或者在灾难的时刻传送系统给他们。这是在昨天教学中谈到的，这就是我们将会传送的，以及我们所寻求的—让人们开始制作减痛笔与减痛包，并理解其他一些事情，凯史基金会会给予金融支持。<br>If you cannot do we will finance. Building and stocking for the disasters that we are there as one nation we deliver. We have to start getting and prepare for what is to come in United State most probably in central of Asia. Governments will abandon because the disaster is so big that they cannot afford to stay but the Keshe foundation will stay on will support and we will see the humanity through. We respond directly we have to respond directly. Those of you who are aware of disaster ask Keshe foundation worldwide with open disaster line that we are there before anybody else that we are there  deliver only very simple things but effective in time of disaster is too much burn and too much damages in too much other thing where we can just give and elevate the pains the needs the water is clean and people through water receive the nourishment and the pain pads and pain pens and the new systems we introduce are the there to change the course and direction.<br>凯：如果你没能力做我们可以在金融上支持你。为灾难来临做好准备，无论是建造什么，还是储蓄什么，我们作为一个国家在那里准备帮助你们，传送东西给你们。我们必须为即将在美国发生的，最有可能在中亚发生的事件做准备。政府将会弃之不顾，因为灾难是如此巨大，政府承担不起继续待下去，但是凯史基金会会保持支持，我们将和人类一起渡过。我们会做出反应，将直接作出反应。如果你们中有人意识到灾难的到来，请通过凯史基金会灾难专线联系我们，我们在那里一直支持你们，我们会传送很简单的但却很有效的东西，灾难带来巨大的烧毁，巨大的损坏，以及其他的。我们会传送笔与包，给人们所需要的，人们也会喝到有营养的干净的水；我们通过介绍笔，包以及系统来改变这个过程与方向。<br>We don’t becomes Samaritans but become Keshe foundation one family which cares for each other. We are not what I call people who talk we are people who deliver we are the first organisation which can deliver peace not the way agreeing peace did financed by different governments and changing as we change wind. We deliver peace through technology we deliver peace through understanding that the technology can bring peace. We will start working with the space agencies openly on the condition of equal share of knowledge. We will take part in health trials directly in a massive way in the coming time. When I say we means the Keshe foundation worldwide please understand the course of the change has already started you have started it the way you do things the way you share knowledge so openly and in your supporting the others to do what you done and with it they develop further information and knowledge that is shipped. The Keshe foundation is not us anymore its becomes the whole of human race as one.<br>凯：我们不是撒玛利亚人，而是凯史基金会的家庭，这个家庭关心每一个人。我们不只是靠说，我们是传送者，我们是第一个传递和平的机构，这个和平不是靠不同的政府的经济支持来达成的口头同意。我们通过技术来传递和平，我们通过理解这项科技能够带来和平从而传递和平。我们会开始与太空机构公开的合作，这种合作建立在平等分享知识的基础上。在接下来日子里，我们将会大规模的参与到医疗实验中来。当我说到“我们”是指世界范围内的凯史基金会，请理解这个改变的过程已经开始，你们以这种公开的做事情和分享知识的方式也开始改变的进程，在你们的支持下，其他人也开始做与你们一样的，他们通过所分享的知识发展出更进一步的信息与知识。凯史基金会不再是我们，而是变成作为整体的整个人类。<br>In the coming time we open as I havesaid  the channels of communication with universal community. They have already made the first contact with those who are of the same school of thought of Keshe foundation amongst the Keshe foundations supporters. Those are contacts which is made in past 7 days 10 days and the response is positive they stay on course and in due time we will show you the rest, you will start seeing a large number of space ships around the planet to be manifesting themselves to show themselves. This is pre-arranged and will be done we do not go for picture we deliver directly we show the first contact last summer I release the pictures myself the videos myself and now we have to start accepting as total of the human race that we are ready to join the universal community.<br>凯：在接下来的时间里，我们会像我们说的公开与宇宙社区的联系渠道。他们已经与持有凯史基金会的同样理念的凯史基金会的支持者取得联系，这些联系在过去7天，10天已经完成，回应是积极的，他们不会盲目行动，保持着既有的进程，我们会在适当的时刻给你们公布其他的内容，你们会看见大量的宇宙飞船出现在地球的周围以此显示自己的存在。这是早已安排好的，并且注定要实现。我们不会用图片，我们直接传送，在去年夏天我们展示过这种接触，我释放了图片和视屏，现在我们要开始接受人类作为一个整体，我们要准备好加入到宇宙社区中。<br>Presentation visualisation communication will be increased in coming weeks in an escalating way. Please understand we are not in the time of playing but we are in a time of delivery, the reason for contacts and opening of the doors is that we have shown collectively we can deliver we can share we have to keep on that course to fully deliver that in that in that way in a way that we are sitting on a the exam table to show that we are not using the technology but we are sharing it correctly amongst all of us. The systems you make the star formations you make the coils of the star formation you make they all create a given signal in time you will understand and these are the signals of peace, collective man change of course of animal less than war into collecting share to elevate peace and destroy any possibility if themisgovernment.<br>凯：直接目击的与地外生命的联系会在接下来几个星期以一种升级的方式快速增加，请理解我们不是在玩游戏，我们是在传送与传达，与地外生命接触和打开地球之门的原因是我们已经在整体性的展示与分享，我们能够传送，我们能够分享，我们必须保持这个进程继续完全的传送所有，通过这种方式我们公众的平台上展示，我们不是在使用这项科技，而是在正确的在所有人之间分享它。你们制作的系统，制作的星型组合，制作的星型组合线圈都会发送一个既定的信号，迟早你们会明白，这些是和平的信号，代表人类一体的信号，代表人类进程改变的信号，代表更少兽性与战争的信号，从而带领你们进入集体的分享中，提高和平的频率，摧毁各种恶政的可能。<br>In the coming days and weeks you will see a number of direct contacts and do not think that it’s just coincidence the more systems you make the more systems you share the faster when the man will be able to get out of this mess which is made for himself for millions of years. When you see with your own eyes when you hear with your own ears then you understand the change has come. We are not here to threaten we are here to develop peace we are here to allow everyone to speak that the knowledge collectively grows. We will not hide we will not stop(dock) we will not take anything out of the equation to share knowledge. It has to be understood every single unit you make you add to the mass of peace we need to work in one direction and the faster we understand how we work in one direction the better we will be in developing the technologies to come.<br>凯：在接下来几天和几个星期，你会看见大量的直接的接触，不要以为那只是巧合。你制作越多的系统，你分享越多的系统，人类就会更快的走出为自己制造的存在百万年的泥淖。当你用你自己的眼睛看见，用你自己的耳朵听见，你就会明白改变已经来临。我们在这里不是在威胁与恐吓，我们在这里是为了发展和平，我们在这里是为了让人们在整体上更多的分享知识，更快的掌握知识。我们不会隐藏，我们不会停止，我们不会从平等的分享知识这个框架中拿掉任何东西，你要明白你所做的每一个单元都是在添加和平，我们需要在同一个方向上工作与努力，而且我们越快理解这个同一性就能更好的发展即将来临的科技。<br>Today this afternoon we start the first and second part of eradicating cancer through the method which we showed 2 days ago. We will send units to most famous people around the world who want to test don’t forget the most powerful people in the world are still human and they suffer from the same diseases as all of us do and we seen now they have put the hands of help to the Keshe foundation to the supporters of the Keshe foundation some of the richest people in Europe have asked the foundation for help for themselves and for their family and we respond correctly and we see the poorest people do and we respond correctly too. The only thing I ask is one thing do not stop sharing knowledge share knowledge and as we said on the 13th and 14th of February give as many units as you can pens, pads to everyone as far as you can go teach them and give them a paper to sign the world peace treaty.<br>凯：今天下午我们开始了第一和第二阶段通过这种我们2天前所展示的技术来消除癌症的实验。我们会把装置送到世界上最有权势的想要测试的人的手中，别忘记这些最有权势的人也是人类，他们也和我们一样遭受着同样的疾病的折磨，我们看到了他们向我们以及凯史基金会的支持者寻求帮助，这些欧洲最有钱的一些人已经向凯史基金会寻求帮助，为了自己和自己的家庭，我们正确的回应了；我们对最穷的人的请求也表示了同样的回应。唯一我所要求的事情是不要停止分享知识，2月13,14号尽可能把更多的笔与包交给人们，尽可能教导他们，并让他们在和平协议上签字。<br> On 21st, 22nd 23rd take pictures and put it on the internet and give the units to soldiers pen for peace it costs nothing but once they have the pain once they go they go barracks and they have the family and they test it they stand the soul. When you give it to the soldiers on 21st, 22nd and 23rd still give it for them to sign the peace they to hold the gun in one hand and the pen which release the pen on the others and the let the conscience decide. We see all  sorts and kinds of pens people are producing, produce more as much as you can that one thing when you do it make sure you put a gift from Keshe foundation. When you give a gift let them know where it comes it has a condition of peace on it. Go to the office of the presidents and the Kings and give a pen to them they need it more for what is about to happen to them. When you give these pens tell them what it means it has to change the soul the emotion and they physicality and let them understand what it is.<br>凯：在21，22，23号拍摄图片，放到网上，将单元装置发送给士兵，笔换取和平，这不花费多少，而一旦他们有了疼痛，一旦他们去兵营，他们有家庭，他们可以测试，他们就能在灵魂层面确认。当你在21,22,23号发给士兵，也要让他们签署和平协议，他们把枪放在一只手，笔在另一只手里，让他们的意识来做决定。我们看见人们在制作各种各样的笔，尽你可能制作更多的，记住，当你制作的时候确保你是将它作为一个来自凯史基金会的礼物，当你送这个礼物时，让他们知道这个礼物来自哪里，而且这个礼物携带着和平的信息。去总统和国王办公室，把笔交给他们，他们需要知道即将发生在他们身上的事情，当你发送这些笔的时候，告诉他们这意味着什么，它能改变情感与灵魂以及肉体物理上的联系，让他们明白这是什么。<br>A lot of people are asking what are we going to do with the systems we shown in the past blueprint we will go into manufacturing and manufacturing companies will produce as many as possible to be able to do and then we show it how it can be done and how it can use it and how we need to control it. The most important part is that we can deliver the peace the rest is irrelevant. All the pieces which we will deliver carry one condition, use it for the peace of man for the peace of your life and in time we will achieve one thing we will still suffer from pain we still break bones and we still saw the sign on cancer but now we have a way to suffer less that’s all it is, none of us will live a life time of thousands of years unless you are in space and even in there we have other conditions all my message for you is very simple be ready that we have opened the door of contact, be ready that we have responded to the need of those who wanted peace and from now on we will see a large and the best month numbers of communication between the universal community and human race.<br>凯：很多人在问我们怎么做上次蓝图中释放的系统，我们会去工厂，而且制造公司会制作出尽可能多的完整的系统，然后我会展示怎样去做，怎样使用，以及我们需要怎样控制它。最重要的是我们能够传递和平，其余不重要。我们传送的所有部分都携带着一个信息，一个条件，用它来换取和平，人类的和平，你的生活的和平，迟早我们会实现一件事情，我们仍在承受各种疼痛的折磨，或者我们的骨头断裂，或者我们看见癌症的迹象，但现在我们有一种方法能够让我们减少这些折磨；没有人能够活到上千年，除非你在太空的特殊环境里，我给你们的所有信息是很简单的，准备好，我们已经打开了接触的大门，从现在开始，我们将会看见大量的在宇宙社区与人类之间的接触。<br> Those of you who worked and responded now you see the benefit of your work. Make as many units as possible to carry the message of peace which is using the CO2 and in turn you will see. You still not or you do not have the power to see how bought your system radiates in the plasma in the centre. This is something which is been in a way hidden from you the plasma you create in the centre of your course carries a message of peace that it can be seen beyond the surface of the planet in your little backrooms. In a way what I have taught you and you have seen with these rings and the coils you been making and especially with the rings which is become more rapid you are turning on the beacons of peace across the universe you do not see the colours of it those who understand see it they see the emotion of it and understand it’s pure. It’s time earth means we want to deliver peace and this is why you are receiving contacts and presentations and visualisations.<br>凯：你们中正在工作与反馈信息的人，你们会看见你的工作带来的益处，尽可能的制作更多的携带和平信息的单元，屏幕上是使用CO2的医疗包，进而你会看见。你们还不能够看见你的系统中间的等离子体的辐射态。这是一种隐藏自己的方式，你在系统中间创造的等离子体携带着和平的信息，这种和平的磁场能够在地球的表面之上被看到，可以就在你的密室中。我教给你们，你们已经看到你们制作的这些圆环与线圈，尤其是变得更快速的圆环，你们就像打开和平的灯塔，这些灯光或信息穿越宇宙，你看不见它的颜色，那些已经理解的人会看见它的情感并理解它是纯净的，现在是时候了，地球意味着我们想要传达和平，这就是为什么你会被地外生命接触，展示给你看到。<br>Every single coil you built up carries a beacon of peace and this is what you not seen you do not have the system to see but in a way I have walked into it to do it because I know what it was it means and what it delivers. Every time you put a coil in operation which creates that free plasma in it that you don’t even see you trust it creates a specific field strength which carries the peace message first of all across the universe build as many as you can not only you start creating peace on this planet but you invite the universal community for peace talks we are ready we are delivering. You could not see 129 but the longer you let your reactors run your coils run the stronger and the stronger it gets as we saw it and those who are running will see beams and light s gradually in the structure and it will be visible these are beacons of peace. Every time you run a Magrav power the way is structures you create a central beacon of peace produce a blue box which is seen across the universe. In time those who have start measuring things some organisations are reporting the same that seeing different effects from these boxes.<br>凯：你所制作的每一个线圈都携带着和平的光之信息，这就是你所看不见的；你们没有系统看不到，但是我能够进入里面并且看到，因为我知道这是什么，意味着什么，传达着什么。你们每一次运行线圈就能在里面创造自由等离子体，是你们看不见的，如果你们相信，就会创造一个特殊的场强度，这种场强度携带着和平的信息，穿越整个宇宙。尽你可能建造的越多越好，这样你就不仅能在地球上创造和平，你也能够与宇宙社区进行和平对话—我们准备好了，我们在传送（自己或信息）。你可能看不到129特斯拉的强度，但是你的反应器运行线圈时间越长，它就会越来越强，就像我们所看见的。那些正在运行系统的人会看见一些光束，每一次你运行你的结构已经设置好的磁引力场装置，你就会在中心创造一个和平的灯塔发出和平的光之信息，它能穿越整个宇宙。最终，那些进行测试的人，那些机构会报道同样的事情，即看见来自盒子的不同效应。（00:45:30）<br>Understand fully what we are getting involved in produce as many as these boxes as these units as you can an let itbe  used, we are not sending a signal of S.O.S to help us what we sending the signal we are ready for peace. That’s why the citation increases you talk you behave we respond. Those of you who have one system for long time and run power systems you will come to understand first and you will come in contact and you will see the visualisation much faster than the others because you are sitting with it amongst it and with it. Today’s teaching is not teaching anymore today’s teaching is sharing the beauty of and thanking you for what you done and what you have brought you shared knowledge and a lot of people are making these what I call beacons of peace do not be afraid that you shared your knowledge that you see or you been or you been contacted if you made your system with purity of heart to achieve peace with peace and in a way elevate pain for the the others you will be enlightened and you will see.<br>凯：充分理解我们正在卷入到什么当中，尽你可能制作更多的这些装置与单元，并让其投入运行。我们不是在发出求救的信号，请他们来帮助我们，我们发出的信号是：我们为和平准备好了。这就是为什么报道增多了。你谈话，你做事，我们来回应。你们中运行一个系统足够长时间，运行能量系统，你会第一次明白，你会取得联系，你会看见视图比其他任何人快，因为你一直与它在一起。今天的教学不再是教你们，今天的教学是分享种种美妙，并且为你们所做的感谢你们，感谢你们带来的分享的知识。许多人正在做这个我成为和平之灯塔的东西，不要害怕，你分享你的知识，分享你所看见和联系上的，只要你是带着纯净的实现和平的心制作这个装置，你就能升华他人，从而你将开悟，你会看见。<br> Today’s teaching is not about making coils now you have made the coils now you have achieved it and a lot of you are doing it today is from now on is how to strengthen the beacon of peace that it opens the door to man not only on this planet but beyond it and with it we will find out we have finished with this inequality on this planet and the people who come with us or come to us will teach us more how to overcome the prejudices that we built for ourselves for those who benefited by to be able to abuse us. Do not be afraid in reporting showing any kind of communication and visualisation you will see the hoax no problem we see those who build things for themselves no problem but you see people who deliver the truth and with it, it will come what it is and what it is supposed to be. Learn how to control your system through your emotion and then if you understood that you understand how if you can control your system through your emotion then why don’t you control your system which is your body through your emotion that you do not suffer, learn the use of the coils and the pens will become irrelevant. The control system which you control you built is to show if you can control something else through your thoughts you can control your own body through the same thoughts.<br>凯：今天的教学不是在谈论制作线圈，你们已经制作了线圈。现在你已经实现了它。今天你们很多人在做，从现在开始，考虑怎么加强这和平的“灯塔”，这给人类打开一扇门，不仅在地球上，而且在地球之外，随着这种改变，我们会发现我们在这个星球上结束了不平等，人们会走过来与我们在一起，教给我们更多知识，克服你为自己设置的偏见，这些偏见是为那些从中得利，并以此奴役你们的人设置的。不要担心害怕展示任何你取得的联系或看到的事物。你会看到这种骗局，没问题；我们看见那些为自己建造这些装置的人，也没有问题；但是你们看见人们在传递真知，随着这种传递，这些知识会实现它自己，成为它自己应该成为的样子。学着怎样通过情感控制你的系统，然后你会明白，如果你能通过情感控制系统，为什么你不能通过情感控制你身体中的系统呢，让你不再遭受痛苦。那么学习使用笔与线圈将会变得毫不相干。你所控制的系统就是能展示出如果你能通过你的意识控制一些事情，你也能通过同样的意识控制你自己的身体。<br>Don’t look at wrong way look at the right way, these systems being the emotional systems being  the control systems through thoughts is to show you that through your thoughts if you can control another system you can control your own system which is your body which is your interaction with the others. These are guide line systems and in time you will all achieve it if the intention is pure. I see people building and making and showing all sorts of different type of systems if it works it’s the intention and then you will deliver it. We have to make this point very clear because of what was shown on last Tuesday on the blueprint for the health we saw the pens which elevate which literally helps with diabetic and addiction and we see the system which can use the total body control for any disease or any condition and we had an insight how systems can be used to control.<br>凯：不要以错误的方式看，要以正确的方式看。这些系统是情感的系统，是通过你的意念进行控制的系统，这些都展示出通过你的意识与意念，如果你能控制系统，你也能控制你身体中的能与其他事物进行互动的系统。这些是指导性系统，你们最终都会实现，如果你们的意愿是纯净的。我看见人们在制作，在建造和展示各种的系统，如果你的意愿是好的，就会起到作用，然后你们再分享与传递。我们必须将这一点讲清楚，因为上个星期二蓝图所展示的医疗笔能够实际的帮助糖尿病和上瘾问题，这个系统能够控制整个身体从而治愈任何疾病以及其他情况，而且我们预见会怎么使用这个系统进行控制。<br>In so many ways we saw the weakness of the man too in so many ways a lot of you looked at the physicality of a system where you  could help yourself with diseases where you could help with control but in fact our teaching was to look beyond the physical condition. The teaching is to look in what you want from the system you will receive, please develop and share, please develop and allow people to share with you. Those of you who are in the countries that cannot support financially to share physically to give. In Keshe foundation we find a way to support you. Those of you who do not see a way out of the problems for yourself to build the system we will send people to teach you. Chinese have started teaching centre, china has started teaching same as the Keshe foundation in Chinese channels the way they see it on teaching on daily basis. We need to understand that we have no borders if you need you put teachings up and you need support contact the Keshe foundation support team and we find a way to be present in your teachings I will find a way to help you to demonstrate and teach. We work collectively as one we now see Mike Nasser as I said Tom Silus going to Hawaii to teach you have been introduced to these people show and teach. Keshe foundation Ghana through Benjamin is gathering massive strength within the structure of correct conduct with officials where now they are testing waters contaminated waters of the rivers within the country.<br>凯：我们也通过很多方式看到了人们的弱点，你们很多人看到这个系统的物理性的一面，将之运用在治疗疾病上；但实际上我们的教学不止于物质层面，教学着眼于你从你的系统中想要得到什么，请发展和分享，请发展并让人和你一起分享。你们中如果没有经济实力去分享去给予，联系凯史基金会，我们会支持你。你们中如果谁没有走出困境找到办法建造系统线圈，我们会派人来教你。中国已经设立了教学中心，中国通过自己的渠道像凯史基金会一样进行教学，他们会实现在每天进行教学。我们需要去理解我们没有分别与界限，<br>如果你需要进行教学，你需要支持，请联系凯史基金会支持团队。我们会找到办法让你的教学实现，使你展示与教导。我们作为一个整体在工作，我们看见麦克-纳赛尔，还有我说的汤姆-塞勒斯去夏威夷进行教学，对那里人进行展示与教学。戛纳凯史基金会通过本杰明正在一个与官员联合的正确导向的结构中积蓄强大的力量，他们正在测试让这个国家内的河流净化。<br>In Middle East we start delivering the technology to the disarster, in the coming weeks we will deliver the technology that soldiers will not remember why they are carrying the gun. As is said from March 1 I will be personally teaching will now be done in the lab floor type if you can do that you can see how we do things. Please inform everybody from every level of your government your local authorities and the rest that you are there and you will deliver. Do you we have anything to share today?<br>凯：在中东我们开始将技术传送到会发生灾难的地方，在接下来几个星期我们将传送技术，士兵们将不记得他们为什么会携带枪支。就像我说的，从3月份我个人会退出教学，加入到实验室的层面上，你们会看到我们是如何做的。请通知每个人，你们政府的各个层面，以及你当地的长官与其余的人，表明你们在那里，要进行传递和分享。你们今天有什么要分享的吗？<br>[Rick]: Well I believe Ali is go something to share.<br>瑞克：恩，我认为阿里有什么事情要说。<br>[Ali]: Yes Hi everyone, Hi Mr. Keshe, Hi Rick thank you for being here last, I mean a few days ago we had a health teaching that one of the gentleman showed that he has established the zero time communication device so he could actually telepathically communicate with the device and receive information from it and on my star formation as Mr. Keshe advise I added three more coils on the bottom and so there is three more stacks on the bottom and after doing I did the next thing with the plasma itself like to go above the unit, putting your head above that and trying to merge with the unified field of consciousness which created the whole universe and after doing that my conscious is expanding quite a bit and I kind of lost a lot of fears that I had before and by one of the things that I realized was the amount of detachment like you got to be really detached from a lot of things to be able to take that step but it actually it’s will connect you back to your own god self or soul self as we speak about it.<br>阿里：是的，各位好。凯史先生，你好。瑞克，谢谢你。前几天，我们一起听了医疗教学，其中一位先生展示了他制作的零延迟通讯系统，他实际上能与设备进行心电感应，并且从它那里接受到信息，按照凯史先生所建议的，我在我的星型组合上加了三个线圈，所以在顶部就有三层的能量层，做了那之后，接下来发生的是等离子体好像向上移动到装置上面，我将头搁置在上面，试图与创造这整个宇宙的整体的意识场相融合，之后，我感觉我的意识在迅速扩展，我有点像是没有了我以前所有的恐惧，从而这让我意识到和感觉到一种超脱，就像是你从很多尘世事情中解脱出来，然后觉得可以进行下一步，但这实际上我认为是将你连接到我们所讲的你的神性自我或者灵魂自我。<br>After doing that I went to a good sleep for about few hours and I realize that there is some kind of image or telepathic transfer of knowledge between the source energy which is coming from plasma to my consciousness and there is a guidance and information coming in, one of the things that came into my baroness was that the star formation that we have can be expanded into a new formation and that formation is called star of David formation so instead of having  tree outer triangle we can double that and make it similar to a Jewish flag which is which has a star of David in the middle and I think there is a reason that, that star is in the there it’s  called the seal of Solomon and it’s something that the ancient races know that has a great significance and that would be next step in developing the system and this star basically the star formation they call it Mekaba as well is around every human being and is around every animal every being in the universe and is a force field that can protect your body and can also be used as a vehicle for going out in two different locations in the physical universe and going into different dimensions of reality so we have about 144 dimensions you can travel within any of these dimensions.<br>阿里：在做了那之后，我去睡了一个几个小时的好觉，我意识到在来自等离子体的能量源头与我的意识之间有某些影像或一些知识的心灵传输发生，有一些指导和信息进来了，其中一个进入到我的意识中的事情是目前的星型组合可以扩展为一种新式的星型组合，这种组合叫做大卫组合之星，代替目前树状的三角形，我们可以进行叠加，使之成为以色列国旗中大卫之星的形状，我认为这有个原因，那里面的星被称作所罗门之印，它表明古代民族知道那里面有着重大的意义，所以这将是发展系统的下一步，这个星，这个基本上的星型组合，他们也叫作梅尔卡巴，梅尔卡巴存在于每个人体中，以及宇宙中每个生命或生物钟，它是一种强场，能够保护你的身体，它也能被用作在物理宇宙中两个点之间进行移动交通工具，以及去真实世界中不同的维度，我们有大约144个维度，你们能在这些维度中任意进行旅行。<br>Having said that I know that there are as Mr. Keshe was saying there are people in Belgium that are against the foundation and so forth as I said god is like a sun gives us light to everybody in the universe and we love given to people who hate us we love everybody and we are here to help alleviate the sufferings that has been bringing the human race and evolve to understand that we are one race and we are all together have to help each other to evolve to a new consciousness and to understand that we’re connected at all levels so if a child is suffering in Africa or in some other countries and if there is a war its going to affectme  it’s going to affect my consciousness because we are all connected up at the very deep in the heart level and if you realize that in our hearts that we are all one we can bring all the three major religions which is a Christianity Islam and Jews together to bring world peace and I do extend a hand of peace from myself and from my ancestors that go back to the prophets and so for Jewish brothers and sisters and to Christians extend my love and brotherhood to them and ask them to be the one with us again and help us to experience the universal peace we don’t have to go to a third world war for the messiah to come back and the messiah is in your heart that Christ is in your heart that resonates with the heart of creation and it can be done in a very beautiful way instead of what some of the scriptures has told us otherwise to do.<br>阿里：我知道，正如凯史先生所说的，比利时的一些人正在针对基金会，就像我所说，上帝就像太阳给我们宇宙中每一个人阳光，我们也对那些恨我们的人给予爱和分享，我们爱每一个人，我们在这里是来帮助人们减少灾难与痛苦，带领人类不断进化，使之理解到我们是一个种族，我们能够在一起互帮互助，从而进化到一种新的意识中，从而明白我们是在各个层面连接在一起的。所以如果一个在非洲或者其他国家的小孩正在遭受苦难，或者有一场战争在发生，这都会影响到我，影响到我的意识，因为我们在很深的心灵层面连接在一起，如果你意识到你在我们的心里，我们能把主要的三个宗教—基督教，伊斯兰教，犹太教结合在一起带来世界和平，我做了和平的扩展工作，从我自己这里，从我祖先那里，我回到先知那里（回到过去？），以及犹太兄弟姐妹，还有基督徒那里，把我的爱与情谊传递给他们，要求他们与我们再次连接在一起，帮助我们经验宇宙和平，我们没必要去经历第三次世界大战从而让弥赛亚回归，弥赛亚在你的心中，耶稣基督在你的心中，我们能够在造物主心中产生共鸣，这都能以一种很美好的方式来实现，而不是经书上所教导的另外的方式。<br>So it can be done in a beautiful way and we are here to help. Having said that after the experience that we had last week we had Derek who was one of the people that just came in touch for few hours with the star formation he had a pain of 25 years in his back and the next day he reported that the pain was gone just being abiding in the field he didn’t even intend to heal it but his body and absorbed the plasma and it got healed and there’s numerous other reports from people that they heal their family relationships just by being in the field so it is something very real and tangible and we are here to learn more of what it is. I do have a guest online his name is Waktang he came up with a really interesting configuration is actually a star tetrahedron it looks like the star of David formation but is in a different form it’s kind of like it is looks like a battery so I am going to bring Waktang online to show his video Waktang are you there?<br>阿里：所以它能以一种很美妙的方式实现，我们在这里可以提供帮助。在这次经验后，上个星期我这里的一个人，名叫德瑞克。他和星型组合接触了几个小时，他在后背的疼痛已经有25的病史，然后第二天他就报告说疼痛消失了，他只是在磁场里带着，并没有想要治愈自己疾病的意愿，但是他的身体吸收了等离子体，病就得到了治愈。有很多来自其他人的报告说他们治愈了他们的家庭关系，只是呆在磁场里，所以这是非常真实可信的。我们可以学到更多关于等离子体的知识。我有一个客人，他的名字是瓦克唐，他带来一个很有趣的组合，事实上是一个四面体，看起来像大卫组合之星，但是有点不同，看起来像是电池，所以我要将瓦克唐请上来，瓦克唐你在吗？<br>[Waktang]: Yes thank Ali<br>瓦：在，阿里。<br>[Ali]: Yes if Rick would you be able to show, start the video for Waktang<br>阿里：好的，你能为他打开视屏吗？<br>[Rick]: I believe so let me see here I think he can start it now, is that correct? He is going to start his video is that what you mean?<br>瑞克：可以。让我看看，我认为他可以开始了，他将要开始了。<br>[Ali]: yeah<br>阿里：好。<br>[Rick]: He should be able to start there now I believe, okay just a second here lets setup view on my second screen<br>瑞克：他应该能够在那里开始了。好的，等一下，让我在我的第二屏幕上设置一下图像。<br>[Ali]; This is Waktang and his brother and they have been working on the project and he did a very interesting formation for which I would like him to show it to us<br>阿里：这是瓦克唐兄弟，他们一直在这个项目上工作，他做了一个很有趣的组合，我想让他为我们展示一下。<br>[Vaktang]:  If you guys remember last we were on a Knowledge seekers workshop we showed the star formation that we wanted to create but me and my brother we was somehow come with me  looking like this so we hadn’t finished the other one because we created a new formation, so everybody is trying figure out how to have the frames and how to be holding the coils without too much matter in the waters. First I put off, I put this on facebook and then I printed and it was like this and it was in the capacitors where it’s a frame but then the total thing at the end this. Can you see it? Can you see it properly?<br>瓦：你们好，还记得上次我们在知识寻求者教学中展示过星型组合，我们想要创造，但可能还没有完善，所以没有完成，因为我们做了一个新的组合，每个人都试着寻找如何拥有一个结构能够固定住线圈，并且不需要太多的物质在里面。我把这个放在脸书上，并打印了下来，它像这样 ，它是在电容器结构里面，但整个结构是这样的 。你们能看清楚吗？<br>[Rick]: Just keep the camera still so it focuses a bit there we are beautiful, very nice.<br>瑞克：固定好相机，对准了一些，好，很好。<br>[Watang]: He has 3 coils inside not 2 so let me explain a little bit more about this. So we decide to have 3 coils in the middle instead of 2 because we only sorted by 3 layers and I just thought even the coils that we make has 3 layers inside just the wire not the coil, so we decided to make each coil with a 3 coils not so they will not be a wire it will be a coil inside and we will have 3 of them in each other like this and each one of them is connecting to 3 capacitors from the star formation and each one of them will have a certain strength by determining by strength of ganses one if them will be CU one of them will be CO2 one of them the smallest one will be CH3 and because I am not joined with each other that there will be joined only on the capacitors and batteries.<br>瓦：里面是3个线圈而不是2个，让我再解释一下。我们决定在里面安置3个线圈而不是2个，因为我们只按三层排列，我想我们的线圈一般都有三层，在里面只是线而不是线圈，所以我们决定给每个线圈制作3个线圈，他们不再是线，而是线圈在里面 （01:04:56），我们有3个这样的 ，他们每一个都连接到来自星型组合的3个电容器 ，它们每一个都会有一个特定的强度，这种强度是由我们设置在线圈上面的不同的甘斯的强度决定的 ，一个是CUO，一个是CO2，这个最小的线圈上面是CH3（从上到下），我并没有将它们之间连结起来，只是将它们与电池和电容器相连。<br>[Rick]: Do the coils have coils inside the coils or wire at all. No wire inside the coil…<br>瑞克：一个线圈包括一个线圈然后在一个线圈里面，完全没有线？在线圈里面没有线？<br>[Vatang]: No just 3 coils instead of the wire it’s a coil in the middle.<br>瓦：没有，只是3个线圈，代替线，在中间是线圈。<br>[Rick]; Okay got it.<br>瑞：我懂了。<br>[Vatang]: so how the our capacitors are setting with each other and they are connected so with the discovered that Ali mentioned like everybody has it around them them these 2 triangles  the twisting the spinning opposite ways so what we did here is the, the top one they go this way so they are connecting with the magnetic to gravitation then magnetical to gravitational which directs the flow this way or the lower one going opposite way and the flow is going upwards and these 3 here are join only by magnetical not gravitational which means that it’s going to be flowing up and in here up and going into themselves so gravitation. So the flow where damage goes up again it might be here or go here. Or got that is goes this way. Everything comes up those  here goes through the gravitation coil. So this you started to spin one towards this way while the other goes the opposite. This is how the cover works after its starts spinning it creates a sphere and when it starts spinning fast enough we should have this like a, like a disc which makes a this sphere look like a space ship so it will look like this a disc around it.<br>瓦：讲一讲电容器彼此之间的连接，就像阿里所提到的那种结构，每个人都以相反的方向扭转这两个三角形，我们所做的是，这上面的是像这样 ，它们连接磁力到引力，就决定了这个流向（逆时针），而这下面的是相反的流向（顺时针） ，这里的流向是向上的 ，这里3个电容器是通过磁力接合在一起，不是引力，这就决定了流向是向上的，但这里的是通过引力向下流，然后磁流相碰撞后又会向上流动 （01:07:04），你们清楚了吗？（瑞克：我想是的）我展示一下这个方式，所有都向上运动 ，从底部到引力中心到顶部，这就是你们旋转延长的方式，在周边形成一个逆时针的场流与一个顺时针的场流，这就是它的工作原理，当它旋转形成一个球面，当它旋转的足够快就会得到一个像圆盘的东西，就会创造这个球面形成宇宙飞船的结构，就像一个圆盘在它的周围。<br>[Ali]: Vatang the purpose of this was to power is it a self-generating power I that this was?<br>阿里：瓦克唐，这样做的目的是为了提供能量使之成为一个自供给的能量源吗，是这样吗？<br>[Vatang]: So this things are self-generating they all connect with the… so if 3 of them connected with one which each whole so every capacitor, there is 9 capacitors that make this star tetrahedron there is 3 coils and 3 of capacitors is connected to each one of them. Middle coil is like a neutral it can be gravitational or magnetically but yeah it is self-generating we connect it to capacitors so the whole structure itself is not prone to nothing that doesn’t belong to it so we connect it to one system.<br>瓦：这些东西时自供给的，他们都连接到，它们3个连接到每个，每个电容器，一共有9个电容器形成这个星型四面体，有3个线圈，3个电容器连接一个线圈，中间的线圈就像一个中子，它可以是磁力，也可以是引力。是的，它是自我供给的，我们将它连接到电容器，这整个结构，我们连接成一个系统 。<br>[Ali]: Mr. Keshe what do you think about this configuration? Hello?<br>阿里：凯史先生，你认为这个组合怎么样？在吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Beautiful<br>凯：很好。<br>[Vatang]: Thank you Mr. Keshe<br>瓦：谢谢，凯史先生。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: If you look at the stuff they did the 2 triangles to see one was meant to be upright but it cannot be shown that way. I am going to share a picture with you maybe its exactly the same with the way you got it. I am going to share a screen with you.<br>凯：如果你看这个结构， 一起看两个的话就有一个是直立的，但这种方式显示不出来。我想分享一个图片，可能和你所做的一样，我要和你分享一个图片。<br>[Ali]: Maybe you have to stop his video<br>阿里：或许得关闭他的视频。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: maybe you can go back on it<br>凯：可以回去。<br>[Rick]: No it should be okay<br>瑞：应该没问题。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It should be okay, I am going on the white board if I get it. I am not getting into sharing the screen because there is another image which is going in the background. Okay. When you look can you see the screen yes.<br>凯：应该是。如果可以，我像在白板上显示出来。我没有分享屏幕，有另一个图像在后台，好了，当你看，你们能看见屏幕吗，好。<br>[Rick]: We are, I think we are seeing your desktop instead of the white board or maybe<br>瑞克：我想我们看见你的桌面，而不是你的白板。或许<br>[Mr. Keshe]: how do I share the white board normally on it<br>凯：我怎么分享白板，我在弄<br>[Rick]: We see white board one on screen right now<br>瑞：我们看见白板在屏幕上<br>[Ali]: Right now it’s a browser and the video.<br>阿里：现在是浏览器<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I go on the share I go on this one, you should see usually it works that way<br>凯：我将分享，我在弄这一个，你们应该看见。它应该这样操作<br>[Rick]:no  we see …<br>瑞克：不，我们看见了，仍然是<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You see the …I do that maybe I have. Do you see the white board now?<br>凯：看见白板？我那样做，或许我可以。你们看见白板了吗？<br>[Rick]: Now you have the paint program now I think that’s what you wanted.<br>瑞克：现在我们看见画板了，我认为这是你想要的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah okay, different program different teachings. The star the way you have is like this but if you look at ti this is the base and the other side of the star of David stands up which is coming up to you which is the other one we usually put it this way. The base, this is your 4 bases and this is the top turning 90 degrees up and when it crosses is where your system is sitting in plasma condition. The free plasmas the star of David is exactly the same as the star formation but one is turned to show the other way round, you look at the one you made which is this and the 2nd one is this, this is your 3 bases and this is your top. This is very much like this and this is your 4th one. The other 2 represent the motion and the soul so when the structure you have created you have more or less achieved to build what we call the human race. In your system you have a complete structure with one centre I think you should be able to achieve quite a bit with it but you have to see how you power it. You have chosen the right combination of 3 different ganses it perfect but go back on the whole structure with your batteries and try to create the same condition in your batteries once you done now you have exactly as you said you have created a flow. With the 3 coils you have chosen you have the 3 flaws you should be able to achieve if you created like the strength the shielding or the representation of the totality this is the same as what we do with the 3 stackers the way it’s done. So if you connect the right way your system as you explained you have 2 systems in different angles make sure your batteries are of the same structures as others  but you have to put the strongest battery in the centre the connection is slight adjustment. CH3 has to be outside they are the one use the copper oxide should be in the in the centre core, don’t forget the plasma strength in the middle. If you put the stronger one outside, see your copper oxide and you have a problem. The 3 coils in a way your magnetical is stronger than your gravitational you understand?<br>凯：好的，不同的程序对应不同的教学。你们制作的星型是这样的 ，这是基座 ，大卫之星的另一边是直立的 ，是朝向你们的，也是我们平时这样设置的 ，这是你的4个基点 ，这个是顶部（最下面的点），旋转90度，当它交叉经过时候 ，就会使你的系统处于等离子体环境中，自由等离子体，大卫之星就是星型组合，但是其中一个三角形是朝向另一方向，你做了一个这样的 ，然后另一个是这样的 （右边），这是你的三个基底，这个是你的顶部 （右边三角形的顶点），很像这样 ，这是第4个 （顶点），另外两个  （画了中间三角形底边的两个端点，又画了中间一点和最上面一点）代表情感与灵魂，你所创造的这个结构或多或少实现了创造我们所说的人类。在你的系统中你有一个完整的拥有核心的结构，我相信你们能够实现很多这些核心，但你必须明白怎样给它提供能量。你们选择了正确的三种甘斯的组合，很好，但是回到你们电池的整个结构中，试着在你们电池中创造同样的条件与环境 ，一旦你们做完，你们就有了你们所说的创造了磁流 ，你们选择的三个线圈就创造这三种磁流，你们应该能够实现，如果你们创造了正确的场强，就会出现磁盾，或者代表这个整体性的圆顶 ，这也是我们对3个能量层所做的方式 ，如果你们把系统连接正确就像你们所解释的，你们就有2个在不同角度的系统，确保你的电池都是一样的结构，但是你得把最强的电池放在中间 （最里面的箭头线），连接有轻微的调整。CH3应该用在最外面的线圈上，氧化铜用在核心，别忘记在中心的是等离子体的强度 。如果你把强一些的氧化铜甘斯放在外面，你就会出现问题，这样的三个线圈，你的磁力是强于你的引力的，明白吗？<br>[Vatang]: yes but we did this because we thought<br>瓦：是的，但是为什么我们，因为我在想….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You are not wrong take me this way you are nowhere wrong you are perfectly right but when you setup these kind of things always remember the behaviour of what we talked about the plasma all the time the centre is the strongest,<br>凯：你没有错，这样想，你哪里也没有错，你做的很对，但是当你设置这些东西时，要记住我们一直所谈论的等离子体的习性，在中间是最强的 。<br>[Vatang]: I saw when we did when we get the plasma we should work the other way rounddoes it, the better way has  showed this one then we it go weaker and weaker and weaker and it has more for outside, the field go outside because the  fields go to this weaker fluids right and what we made in the centre was the you wanted to coat with gans but we don’t coat in the middle coils because this way the fields are going inside because its weaker in the middle.<br>瓦：我看见，当我们得到等离子体我们应该以另一种方式来工作，比较的好的方式，从最强的集合变得越来越弱，有多的磁场能够覆盖到外面，磁场会到外面，因为磁场会变成弱的流动，我们记得，在中心所要做甘斯涂层，但我们对中心的线圈不进行涂层，因为通过这种方式磁场会向内流到中心。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No,The fields have a habit to take what they need if you produce the what you call the your heavier ganses in the centre you always will create the interaction which opens up and you don’t want to do too much too fast when you put the heavier outside this is what I think, try it and you try what you done. Has this system shown any reaction?<br>凯：不，这个磁场有一个习性就是只获取自己所需的，如果你生产了你所说的在中间的甘斯，你就会创造一种互动，一种能打开周围空间的互动，你就不需要做太多太快，当你把更重的甘斯放在外面，这是我想的，你可以试试，试着做你想做的。这个系统显示出一些反应吗？<br>[Vatang]; No it’s a prototype I didn’t have time Mr. Keshe working on the stuff takes a lot of time.<br>瓦：不，这只是雏形，我没有时间，凯史先生，在这些事情上工作得花费大量时间<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I have seen it, it takes a long long time, the problem with you lot is you are too fast you lot, what you do in one week or in a few days it takes it used to takes weeks to do it cause I take time I look at where it is what I have to do and you are young and you are just on the edge to do what you see I used do that. Nowadays I sit and think a long time before I make a system so you done nothing wrong but it’s another formation is another way to do it.<br>凯：我看见了，它花很长很长的时间，你的问题是你太快了，你所做的是在一周内或者几天做好，但它一般得花几个星期去做，因为我花时间，我看它在那里，我必须做什么，你还年轻，你正在接近你看见的这个领域中，我以前就也是这样。今天我坐在这里想起很久以前，在做这个系统之前，所以你没有做错什么，但这是另一个组合，要用另一种方式去做。<br>[Vatang]; so the 3 coils is ok to  them yeah?<br>瓦：所以像这样中间的三个线圈没有问题吧？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Pardon?<br>凯：再说一遍？<br>[Vatang]; The 3 coils in the middle is it good to have to or should we…<br>瓦：在中间的3个线圈可以吗，还是我们应该……<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Of course there is nothing, nothing is wrong you are showing us another innovation from the, what do you call it angle of science there is nothing wrong you have shown us a beautiful system it’s nothing wrong with it we with the way you did, that’s why we are all knowledge seekers we learn and we add we seen how every one of us drinks from the end how we enjoy sharing so it’s just that if to me if you want to create a system which creates a 3 layer to create the a the visible structure you have to follow the field forces if you lose too much you put the stronger outside you shield the field from inside to show its interaction, but as you put the heavy ones CO2 CuO in the centre you are allow controlled radiation because the other 2 field will peel it off and in that peeling off you create the interaction and the visibility.<br>凯：当然，没有什么是错的，你们在给我们展示另一种创新，这就是你们经常说的高端科学，没有什么错的，你们展示了一个很美好的系统，你们所做的没有什么错的，这就是为什么我们都是知识寻求者，我们在学习，我们在增进新的知识，我们看见每个人进来学习，享受这种知识的分享，所以只是，如果你想要创造一个有三层的能制造可视化结构的系统，你们要遵循这个磁场力的流动规律，如果你失去很多，你将强的甘斯放在外面，你就罩住了来自里面的磁场，阻碍它与外界的互动；但是当你把比较重的甘斯如CO2，CUO放在中心，你就能允许一种可控的磁场的散射，因为另外两个磁场会剥落，在剥落中你就创造了互动与可视化。<br> You not even, it’s another way this is what I was teaching. One of the thing which you will see this is part of what I was teaching yesterday to the students and we go back because we spoke before about it is when you start creating this system you should be able to see when you created your sphere with your pyramid or whatever whichever systerm you do . You see with the Ali these systems you should be able to see a lighting system to s\give you a guide line how centralize you are, if you create a balance plasma and always put a light in the background somewhere put a very bright light or a light barrier testing and see if you continuously you see one light on the position or this is that start seen 2 or 3 lights.<br>凯：这是另外一种方式，这就是我们要教学的。你们会看到的一件事情是我昨天向学生所传授的知识的一部分，我们回到我们谈论它之前，当你创造了这个系统，你应该能够看到，你借助你的金字塔或无论你做的什么系统 创造了你的球面，如你们看见的阿里的系统，这些系统你们应该能够看见一个灯光系统，给你一个指导线集中你的视线，如果你创造了一个平衡的等离子体 ，把一个灯光放在背景后面某处 （上面一点），放一个很明亮的灯光，为了测试。看你是否能够持续的在这个位置看见灯光，或者在这圆顶上面左右两边都看见一个灯光 。<br>When you start seeing 2,3  lights or flashes of light in respect to the lighting of the back it means that you have start creating the atmosphere of the system, you get measure and you got to see where the lights sits, you get the measure of the atmosphere which you are making, how what is your strength of your system how deep is your system I explain this in the teaching yesterday to the student of the knowledge seekers we have spoken about this before and it’s a good time to bring it back for those of you who were not in the teachings. If you look and go back and I always said in the other teachings that go and look into the Japanese the television program they made the program in those Pakistan Kazakhstan the north parts of Russia where we see 3 suns at the same time they call it the rise of 3 suns. There is a condition of the atmosphere of the earth that is creates in conjunction with the magnetosphere of the earth that we see the light but we see 2 reflections of it.<br>凯：当你开始看见相对于背后灯光的在前面的2个或3个灯光或闪光，这就意味着你开始创造了这个系统的大气场 ，你可以测量，看灯光在哪里，你可以测量你所制造的大气场 ，你的系统的强度是怎样的，你的系统有多深，我昨天向知识寻求者学生讲授过这个知识，我们以前谈过，是时候将这个知识重新给你们不知道的人说一遍。如果你回过头看，我总会在一些教学里讲，看日本的电视节目，他们在巴基斯坦，哈萨克斯坦以及俄罗斯北部录制节目，在那里可以同时看见3个太阳，他们称之为3个太阳的升起 。这是地球大气层的环境与地球磁层圈相结合而创造的，我们看见亮光 ，然后是它的2个反射。<br>So it show literally the boundary of the earth the magnetosphere that you create the Magrav that you create. So when you put if you don’t have any system you want to see if you are creating a plasma field this is one of that way to stand in front of it and look in the light and put in the background it gives you good indication. So you have this and this shows you a boundary as I explain in the teaching yesterday go outside at night and look where you find 3 the stars in line, you see 2 at this moment in the northern hemisphere, it’s the same position. The 3 stars in line are in fact one is the real star the other 2 are mirages, you see the centre line the centre star much brighter than the other 2 at that point when we look and we see this this show the boundary of the galaxy our galaxy is looking into the sun another galaxy which is coming most probably is here and the light behind comes that in conjunction with the atmosphere of our galaxy creates the illusion of 3 suns so wherever you see in the sky 3 stars in line look the centre one is brighter then the other 2 you know these 2 are fake.<br>凯：所以这就展示了地球的边界，展示了你的磁引力场装置的磁层圈。当你放置的时候，如果你没有系统，你想要看见，如果你创造了一个等离子体的场域，这就是通过灯光来看清楚的方式，把灯光放在背景后面，它能给你很好的参照和指示。如果你有这些灯光，它们就给你展示了边界 ，就像我昨天在教学中所讲的，在晚上走出去，如果你在天空中看见3颗星在一条线上 ，你在北半球同时看见2个，在同样的位置。这三颗在一条线上的星 事实上其中一个是真的，另外两个是幻象，你看见在这个时刻中间的星比另外两个更明亮，这条曲线就展示了星系的边界 ，我们的星系对向太阳，另外一个星系从那边过来，亮光在后面，光线过来与我们星系的大气层相交合产生3个太阳的幻象 ，所以无论什么时候你看见有3颗星在一条线上，并且其中一颗星比另外两颗更明亮，就知道这两颗是假的 。<br>You wouldlike to go to this star but in fact it’s not there. This happens quite often you see sometimes 3 stars like this and you find a star like this. These 2 are fake this one is fake too. You see about 7 or 8 of them at the moment the real one is here, what you see is a horizon of the field and it’s a reflection of this angle which creates a second like. Because at this moment the star near is halfway enough to create the fourth image. So in space you have 4 images but in fact one is real. We think we are looking at the star anytime we look at the star formation like this and I take this out in this in the skies you know only one is real the other 3 are all fake they are reflections you can try to go to this star for billions of years you never arrive because it’s not there. When you make your systems this allows you the say put the thing on and you can see the boundaries you can see if your system is reflecting light out itself that you can see elevation of your own system.<br>凯：如果你想到那颗星上去，但事实上它并不在那里。这种现象很频繁，你们有时看见3颗像这样的星 ，你也会发现一个在这里的星 （上面的一颗），这两个是假的，这一个也是假的 ，你看见7个或8个，但真正的一个是在这里 ，你看见的是场的视觉化 ，是从这个角度反射所创造的第二个 （01:24:28)，这时附近的一颗星足够在发出自己光线的半途创造第四个幻象 （即圆顶外的第四颗星），所以在太空中你有4个景象，但只有一个是真的。我们是在看星星，如果我们看星型组合 ，我们把这颗星从天空中拿走，你就知道只有一个是真的 ，另外3个是假的，是反射的，你能去这颗几十亿光年的星那里，但你永远到达不了，因为它不在那里。当你制作你的系统，这就允许你，你把这个东西放在这里 （圆顶后面的灯光），你就能看到边界，你能看见，如果你的系统反射它自己的光 ，你就知道你的系统得到了提升。<br>You understand so you don’t  need equipment and expensive equipment these are little tools of testing when now that the lot of you start creating these Magrav systems. Oh we are in Philippine, hi Renon. So in your star if David what you have created do not forget that your capacitors behave as reflectors of the energy too. So what I think you will get the way you setup your system your capacitors you should be getting a system a system very, if your reactor is here you should be getting a system long sided like this. You will not I don’t think , if you look at normal systems when you put the light there and you create the magnet sphere. If you use the normal room because you have a moisture in the room all the time you will see these reflection so you see the 3 staffs. In fact you see this one here but the way you setup your system I think you get the, your system is here and you get the plasma like this. You will not get the plasma fully like this.<br>凯：明白吗？你不需要装备和昂贵的装备，这些是小的测试工具，当你们开始制作磁引力场系统时需要的。哦，我们在菲律宾，嗨，雷农。所以你所制作的大卫之星，不要忘了，你的电容器也表现为能量的反射。所以我认为你得到你设置你的系统的方式，你的电容器，你应该得到一个系统，如果你的反应器在这里 ，你应该得到一个系统的像这样的长边 ，你将不会，我不认为，如果你看正常的系统 ，如果你一个灯光放在那里 （上面一点），你就创造了一个磁层球面 ，如果你在正常的房间里进行，房间里一般有潮湿，你会看见反射，看见3个闪光点 ，事实上第三个在这里 （中间一点），当你设置你的系统，你的系统在这里，你会得到一个这样的等离子体 （中间一点是系统），你会得到一个完全像这样的等离子体[Rick]: Mr. Keshe Armin just sent me a picture it’s got 3 suns that he wanted to show, is that what you wanted to see?<br>瑞克：凯史先生，阿曼刚给我发来一个图片，是关于3个太阳的，他想要分享，你想要看一下吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes because it was taught in the teachings, if you have it then you can show us then we see the real condition. Yes you see this is taken in Russia. This is known as a condition of 3 stars. It happens this is earth atmosphere it took the Japanese team nearly 3 months to get it, it happens 2, 3 times a year in that area. When the motion is right when the magnetic field structure is right, this is what you get it’s a reflection. In fact when I say you know you put 2 mirrors opposite each other and you see thousands of yourself on either side of it earth atmosphere happens like this and the same thing happens when the stars come in to angle so you see the centre one is much brighter so uniformity than the other 2, so when you make you make your system you put a light in the back and you see if you see reflections on the either side. The positions of your reflections will show you the strength and the direction of your plasma. Thank you very much.<br>凯：是的，这是在教学中讲过的。如果你有，你可以展示给我们，我们就可以看到真实的情形。是的， 你们看见的是在俄国拍摄的。发生在北半球，日本团队花了三个月得到的，在那个区域一年中只会发生两到三次，当移动是正确的，当磁力场结构是正确的，你就会得到，这是一种反射。事实上，当你把2面镜子相对放着，你会在另外一边看见上千个自己，地球大气层发生的情形也是如此。当星星以一定的角度进来时同样的事情也会发生。你可以看到中间的更亮，而且更均匀比其他两个。所以当你制作你的系统，把一个灯光放在后面，你会在另一边看见一些反射，这些反射的位置就展示了你的等离子体的强度以及方向。很感谢。<br>[Vatang]: there is more I would like to say Mr. Keshe<br>瓦：凯史先生，我们还有一些事情要说。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: wait you see the people sitting there? And you see the top rainbow in the back the reflection, that reflection on the back is the light which comes from the earth up to the interaction it’s exactly the way you see it, depends on the strength then you see 4 lights and then the centre one is the real one. If you look the light don’t look at that rainbow colour on the top look on top just above the sphere itself there. So when you see your system when you put your system in the centre even the Star of David and you put a light a in the back of it you see this too. When you make your flight system this is one of the indications of it, there is a lot of this available. There is American and this is on the moon they left the flag behind. Do you see Armstrong’s footsteps there? So when you set your system it’s a very simple too small light in the back to see the boundary of your plasma. Thank you very much Rick<br>凯：等一下，你们看见人们坐在那里了吗？  看见在背后反射出的彩虹吗？这种在后面的反射是来自于地球向上进行反应的灯光，就像你看到的。这取决于相关的强度，然后你就会看见4个灯光，中间的一个是真的，你看光，不要看上面的彩虹的颜色，看顶部，球面的上方 。所以当你看见你的系统，当你看见你的系统，当你把你的系统放在中间，即使是大卫之星，你把灯光放在背后，你就能看到这样的效果。当你做你的飞行系统，这个灯光就是一个指示。有很多这样的例子。这是美国，是在月球上，他们把国旗留在那里 。你看见阿姆斯特朗的脚印了吗？当你设置你的系统，可以很简单的把一小的灯光放在背后以此观察等离子体的边界。瑞克，很感谢。<br>[Vatang]: We also made a first knowledge seekers workshop when we are Astrulia  on Monday we would like your opinion on that and should we continue to …<br>瓦：星期一，我们在澳大利亚也做了一个知识寻求者教学,我们想要征求您的意见，我们是否应该继续….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes please do<br>凯：是的，请继续<br>[Vatang]: And we have for people that came for this workshop they are from Melbourne Australia so each one of them pretty much who is from different state which makes it very good so we can.<br>瓦：一些人也来到我们这个教学课堂，他们来自澳大利亚墨尔本，他们来自不同的州，这样做很好，所以我们能<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you repeat what you said please?<br>凯：你能重复一下你说的吗？<br>[Vatang]: There was around 30 people, 40 people that attended the first one and it seems that all of them are from different states which means we got a whole grasp on the whole country and everybody is waiting for somebody to take a step and organise all of them together and work together and me and my brother decide to step ahead and start to start making those things which was on Monday first one and on every 7pm every Monday we want to continue this and yeah.<br>瓦：<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Keshe foundation Australia is very big, its huge it’s just need somebody to bring them together, you have a very large Iranian Keshe foundation supporters community in Australia we have had the people a couple of years now.<br>凯：澳大利亚凯史基金会是很大的，巨大的，它需要某个人把他们联合起来，在澳大利亚，你们有一个很大的伊朗凯史基金会支持者社区，我们的一些人在那里已经有几年了。<br>[Vatang]: We didn’t know this<br>瓦：我们不知道这些情况。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes we know that there is a lot of people who are there to do the work we have a doctor in Melbourne which we work with for some research.<br>凯：是的，我们知道有很多人在那里做这项工作，我们有一个医生在墨尔本，这个医生是与我们一道的，在做一些研究工作<br>[Vatang]: We are from Melbourne too.<br>瓦：我们也来自墨尔本<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah is we have run couple of cases in your area in Melbourne and we know there is a very big support base in Australia.<br>凯：是的，我们已经运行了好几个组织在你所在的区域，在墨尔本。我们知道在澳大利亚已经有一个很大的支持基地。<br>[Vatang]; I talked to one Iranian journalist from Melbourne she got a cup from you she says, a health cup.<br>瓦：我与一个来自墨尔本的伊朗记者谈过话，她有一个杯子，她说，一个健康杯。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: She is still there<br>凯：她还在那里。<br>[Vatang]: Yeah the contact of these people …<br>瓦：是的，与这些人联系……<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Pardon?<br>凯：重复一遍<br>[Vatang]: Is it possible to contact all these people there are Keshe foundation in Australia because we did know like 30 people.<br>瓦：联系这些人可能吗？在澳大利亚的凯史基金会的这些人，因为我们已经知道有这样的30个人了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah there is a huge number of support in Melbourne in Perth in Sydney there are all, nobody has ever bought them together but it’s a huge number.<br>凯：是的，我们知道在墨尔本，在珀斯，在悉尼，没有人想过要把他们联合在一起，但那是一个巨大的数量。<br>[Vatang]: But we would like to go that very much Mr. Keshe<br>瓦：但我们很想那样做，凯史先生。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Yes organise get in touch with Brad setup the Keshe foundation Australia and then we give you the website and access the everything else the platforms all be ready  just built up and it yours to go ahead with, Almand do you have any, Brad do you have anybody requesting for the Keshe foundation Australia if it is online. He is asleep he was working late I was taking to him till 2, 3 hours ago.<br>凯：好的。组织吧，与布莱德联系，建立起澳大利亚凯史基金会，我们给你网址和权限，平台上其他东西都准备好了，只要筹建即可，你接着做就可以了。阿曼，你有，布莱德，你知道有谁在申请建立澳大利亚凯史基金会，如果你在线的话？他睡着了，昨天工作很晚，2,3个小时前我刚和他说话。<br>[Shandar]: Its Shandar here this yes there are request from Australia and there is another thing that somebody registeredthe Keshe foundation Australia without our knowledge.<br>珊达：我是珊达，有来自澳大利亚的申请，还有一个事情，有人已经注册了澳大利亚凯史基金会，在我们不知道的情况下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What’s the name who…<br>凯：名字是，谁？<br>[Shandar]: it’s not, we could not get that data from the company thatregisteredit from Australia we hear from an agent locally who can go on ask for the, so what we could obtain from the internet it shows that it was registeredbut without the name of the person who registeredit.<br>珊达：我们不能从这个来自澳大利亚的注册的公司身上得到数据信息，我们是从当地的一个代理人得知的，他向我们询问了相关的事情，我们能从网上得知它被注册了，但不知道这个人的名字，不知道是谁注册的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah a lot of people around the world have registered Keshe foundation to protect it that nobody else should abuse it we know that, in a large number of countries Keshe foundation is been registered as a company that it is by the follower and protectors of the foundation.

Keep in touch with Vince and he will show you the way to do it.<br>凯：这是我们会带来的一部分，我们会将你们置于同样的位置，因为我们对所有的凯史基金会网站在一个服务器上进行统一的管理，这是你说的澳大利亚太空网站spaceshipinstitute或者澳大利亚凯史基金会keshefoundation，联系 keshefoundation.org，文斯，那样可以完成吗？好的，联系文斯，为网站做好分类，平台已经做好了，你只需要填写相关的信息，提交澳大利亚的相关信息，可以分配给你一个网站管理员。与文斯保持联系，他会告诉你怎么做。<br>[Vatang]: Thank you<br>瓦：谢谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What we are doing is that by why you put Australian on a French or Italian.keshefoundation.org or .spaceshipinstitute so you come on the one you don’t need to pay for severs we pay for all the cost in the background but you all go through the same common servers we go we can put mirrors on them reflect whatever you want to do with other Keshe foundation invited what you call it Keshe foundations from other groups to participate in certain activities now we see the inter connections of different groups you see in the Austria’s going to India to support Abina and we see as I said Mike Nasser going to Hawaii to teach in Hawaii to support the Keshe foundation supporter of Hawaii.<br>凯：我们所做的就是你们建立了澳大利亚，法国，或意大利的凯史基金会或者太空飞船协会，我们能在同一个平台上，你们不需要为服务器付费，我们在后台承担了费用，但你们可以通过同一个服务器，我们能够及时的处理你们出现的错误，无论你们想做什么，与其他受邀的凯史基金会一起参与到某些活动中，这就是我们看到的内在的连结，你看到澳大利亚的志愿者去印度帮助阿比那，还有我说的麦克-纳赛尔去夏威夷教学，去支持夏威夷的凯史基金会支持者。<br>[Vatang]; Yes we are also training to go back to Georgia because we are from Georgia and Georgia is pretty much missing out from this information we would like to get the wheel spinning here and …<br>瓦：是的，我们也准备回到格鲁吉亚，因为我们来自格鲁吉亚，格鲁吉亚十分缺乏这类相关的信息，我们想要把这些技术<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Your president office already has a unit<br>凯：你们的总统办公室已经有一个单元了<br>[Vatang]; Yeah but there are nothing …<br>瓦：是的，但那没什么<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It was given by Almin its Almin who flew, Almin drove actually to Georgia well<br>凯：是由阿曼送的，事实是阿曼开车去格鲁吉亚<br>[Vatang]: I know there was but nothing is really happening over there they just have it they showed I think one time on T.V and that’s it. Nobody really I mean you know Australia people still understand a little bit about this technology but in Georgia we going to need a little bit more time to get …<br>瓦：我知道，但那里其实什么也没有发生，他们只是有了，他们可能在一次电视上展示了，就那样。没有人真正，我的意思是澳大利亚的人至今也只是知道一点点这个技术，何况格鲁吉亚需要更多的时间才能知道一点<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we have worse to share in midlands the British are worse they have a lot of little groups that haven’t gathered together yet Georgia is not far behind don’t worry but there is a lot of people we try to bring you community and the Keshe foundation banner and we will see it going in that way just ask get in touch with webmaster ask for the Keshe foundation Australia as keshefoundation.org so I think Carlos has already made a the platform we are just given to fill it up and you bring it up am I correct Vince?<br>凯：我们在英国的米德兰进行的更糟，他们说了一大堆至今也不能联合起来，格鲁吉亚没有落后，别担心，有很多人，我们会把你们带进一个社区中以及凯史基金会的旗帜下，就像澳大利亚凯史基金会keshefoundation.org，我认为卡洛琳已经建造了这个平台，我们只需要在上面填写信息，你再建立起来，我说的对吗？文斯<br>[Vatang]; Thank you very much<br>瓦：十分感谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You are welcome thank you very much this is the Thursday is more or less becoming international teaching and we try to teach or learn from each other as the things comes out we add to the knowledge the star of David you made is structured that you need to have at least 4 of do you understand?<br>凯：不客气。很感谢你们。这个星期四的教学差不多成为了国际教学，我们之间相互学习与探讨，有新东西出现，我们会扩展相应的知识，就像你们所做的大卫之星，你需要有至少4个，你明白吗？<br>[Vatang]: Yes the plan was to have it instead of a stacker unit so yeah…<br>瓦：是的，原本的计划就是用来取代原来的能量盒单元，是的</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]; you need to have at least 4 of to be able to do it and you will create a single system 3 layers but the totality will lead to the physical observation. In the next few weeks we announce we bring all the people like you and the others who come up to the line of understanding the control and development into one centre. We bring all the people who work on the agriculture on the health into one point we give you 3 months to complete the project. We finance all the expenses then all of you who work on these projects we see whose there and whose coming up we bring you up and who is spoken to Ali about this that we are going to bring people in. So now that we announce the way as spaceship city we try to organise it that we all come together for period of 2, 3 months and in that time instead of all of you maybe 2, 300 to build the ship the ones who do the side will complete the health side the ones who do the structure they do the structure the ones who do the what I call the agriculture and the rest will come all together, it’s just a plan we hope we can execute on June, May, June let’s just hopefully we can do it so we are watching whose doing what and how much you can bring in to the knowledge and then we come together as one unit and they will you the time of 3 months to deliver.<br>凯：你们需要至少4个以完成这个系统，你会创造一个单一的系统，有三层结构，但是整体上会形成一个物理性的观测结构。在接下来的几个星期，我们宣布，我们带领你们像你们这样的所有人和其他人来到一个理解控制与发展的界线以进入到同一个中心，我们会带领所有在农业方面，在医疗方面工作的人进入到一个临界点，我们给你们三个月时间去完成这个项目工程。我们负担所有的开销，你们所有工作在这个项目上的人，我们看谁在那里，谁来了，我们带领你们过来，那些与阿里对话的人，我们会带领人们进来。所以就像我们宣布太空城一样，我们试着组织起来，我们联合在一起，2到3个月，在这个时间内，可能2300个人建造飞船，做飞船外面的人做外面，做飞船结构的人做结构，还有在农业和其他方面工作的人都一起过来，这是一个计划，我们希望在6月执行，希望我们能够完成。我们正在观察谁在做什么，以及你能够带来什么东西，然后我们在一起做一个单元，3个月时间来传达这个信息。<br> I brought the guy from turkey from Cyprus Ali was nothing to be delivered it was only what we thought but as we seen we make mistakes and that was one of the biggest one and we will look the people journal were not shot and so if you carry on with what you are doing and the others that’s the job of Ali in the background in Canada we will bring you all together we are looking and making mark in the books for us that we don’t spend billions over 20, 30 years we are doing the work in the background we bring everybody together we will come as one big family and that’s what I told you in next 2,3 months are become hands on. We work all together the way we did in the Soncino as one team 2,300 what I call plasma scientist to build what we are we change the course. So thank you very much for your work.<br>凯：我把土耳其塞浦路斯的阿里带过来，但什么知识也没有传递，这是我们所犯的错误，是最大错误中的一个，我们将会看人们自己做的实在的东西而不是人们刻意拍摄的，所以如果你或其他人带来像加拿大阿里在实验室所做的事情，我们会将你们联合起来，我们在寻找，在标记这些人，我们不会花费数十亿和20，30年时间来做这项工作，我们把每个人集合在一起形成一个大家庭，这就是我要说的，在接下来2到3个月开始联合起来。我们联合在一起就像在松奇诺作为一个团队时所做的，2300个等离子体科学家来建造这个飞船，来改变人类的进程。所以，感谢你们所做的工作。<br>[Vaktang]: Mr. Keshe thank you everybody<br>瓦：谢谢，凯史先生。<br>[Ali]: Thank you Vaktang. Mr. Keshe this is Ali I was thinking about the free plasma as a source of the battery we should be able to share can I share my video?<br>阿里：谢谢瓦唐，凯史先生，这里是阿里，我在想让自由等离子体成为一种电池的能源，我们是否可以分享我的视屏？<br>[Rick]: yes go ahead<br>瑞克：好，可以<br>[Ali]: okay hi everyone Mr. Keshe I was thinking about this coil and I was thinking can I  use something like this is a source of energy like in the middle we have the coil and we have  free plasma generated in there so this can…<br>阿里：各位好。凯史先生，我在想这个线圈，我在想我能用这样的在中间的东西 作为一种能量源，我们有线圈，我们有在中间产生的自由等离子体，所以这样能<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Ali I think you better move out of Canada. I tell you why. This is what I thought if our people  ready for us this close it can use as a power this morning I had to go to a meeting the guy most probably is listening a French very nice scientist and  on the way there and back I had this in my head can we go to the next step? Are the people there to see it and then as usual you come up with this and now as I said lets teach. I hope those of you who understand will be enlightened in different way. What you showed us now is this. What you are asking is that I have to get my painting or I have to go home okay. What you are asking if you can put this coil in this system to extract the energy if the plasma which you have created in the centre. Am I correct?<br>凯：阿里，我想你最好离开加拿大，我来告诉你为什么。 ，这是我所想的，我们的人是否准备好这个，关掉它。它能作为一种能源，今天早上我去参加一个会议，有一个人很可能在听，一个法国的很友好的科学家，在回来的路上我在想我们是否应该进行下一步？人们是在那里看吗？像往常一样，你提出来了，就像我说的，那就教吧。我希望你们中理解的人能够以各种方式受到启发。你给我们看的是这个 。你所询问的是，我得找到我的彩色笔，我回到主页，好的，你所询问的是是否能将这个线圈放在这个系统中 ，以此来提取中间的你所创造的等离子体的能量，对吗？<br>[Ali]: yes<br>阿里：是的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay you have created the plasma here and you want to tap into this energy the answer is yes. It will be extremely powerful and if you can make a double coil of it can somebody tell me why I can’t hold on to the bar?<br>凯：好，你在这里创造了等离子体 ，然后你想从中提取能量，回答是可以。这将会是十分强大的，如果你能制作一个双线圈，谁能告诉我我怎么控制不了我的面板？<br>[Shandar]: Click next to the question mark and it will remain there, on the right side next to the question mark on the blue, yeah put this…<br>珊达：点击紧邻问题符号的傍边，它还在那里，在问题符号的右边，蓝色的，是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much<br>凯：好，知道了，感谢<br>[Shandar]: Okay<br>珊达：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much so now what you got to remember make it 2 you have to have the 2. So double coil it then you take both magnetical gravitational field from it but that isn’t very important at all, you open the door I teach you more. Take your double coil that you made and put inside it your rotating coil do you remember those gans coils you made. A lot of you made a lot of coils gans coils. Place it in the centre Those gans coils you made now receiving the power from your coils becomes a very powerful system this is what I what you to do in March or April when you come here around after April May or whatever. This is the way then we do a coils you can control the direction of the flow of the field. You don’t keep your coils steady in one place as they are, by moving the coils in either direction you automatically control the direction of the plasma from the centre you dictate direction of motion. Do you understand? So instead of putting the coils yes you can get huge amounts of energy out of the coils. If you get the right structure in the coil you can produce most of the spectrum of the energy of the plasma.<br>凯：十分感谢，我们得明白要使之成为双线圈，要有2个 。叠加的双线圈，你就会从中得到磁引力场（引力场与磁力场），但这根本不重要。你打开了门，我就教你更多。拿着你所制作的双线圈，放在这里面 ，你的旋转线圈 （中间的蓝色圈），你们还记得你们所做的甘斯线圈吗？你们很多人做了很多的甘斯线圈，把它放在中间 ，你所做的甘斯线圈从你的线圈中吸收能量从而变成一个强大的系统 （01:51:22），这就是我想要你们在三月或四月所做的，通过这个线圈你可以控制磁场的流动方向 ，你不需要将线圈固定在某个位置，通过在另一个方向上移动线圈，你可以自动的控制中心的等离子体的运动方向 ，你决定运动的方向。明白吗？通过放置线圈，是的，你能得到大量的来自线圈的能量。如果你将中间的线圈设置正确的结构 ，你能产生来自等离子体的大部分频谱的能量 。<br> If you connect and put your coil the rotating coil in the middle and put your coils around your core and around the 2 you will find the creation of the fields another way, very powerful. So you enhance the energy in multiple fold but you have to find the way to energy your motors to a plasmatic condition or just create a coil that it has a gans that you can create rotation in it. Then this way you achieve what we saw with our friends in Australia. You create the coil and you run a core inside the coil. You compress the gravitational field so heavy that the building of the what do you call the 3 structures that is the same. Very powerful You can use the coil or at the same time you can use your cores to create. This single core coil the way you see it here was the very first to go into the history of man we used to see a space ship like this. The space ship like this are new interests. And these coils, these cores used to use a very simple system like this to it.<br>凯：如果你连接好，把你的旋转线圈放在中间，然后把你的线圈围绕你的核心线圈 ，围绕这个双线圈，你会发现所创造的磁场流向另一个方向 ，十分强大。所以你是在通过褶皱重合加强能量，但是你得一个方法给你的马达供能 ，使之成为等离子体环境。或者只是创造一个线圈，线圈上有甘斯，就创造出里面的旋转。这种方式就实现了我们澳大利亚朋友所做的。你创造了线圈，然后你在这个线圈里面运行一个核心线圈。你在如此的挤压引力场，这三个结构的建造也是一样受到挤压。很强大。你能使用这个线圈，同时你能使用中间的核心线圈去创造，在这里的这种单核心线圈 是非常初始的，如果你回看人类的历史上，宇宙飞船像这样 ，而这样的是新式的建立在星型组合基础上的 ，而这些线圈，这个核心被用作一个很简单的像这样的系统 。<br>They used to move the gravitational field, magnetical field by rotating  controlling very similar processes as the coils you have. So you have the core in the centre that’s why we need the cores we remember if you remember with the core the copper core we made and then the control was done through this kind of operation because you can turn this way you change the direction that way and then you can turn this up and you could elevate that way or you could bring it in line you go in that direction and in this way. This is old version very original spaceship which visit the earth used this kind of near technology and it’s very powerful its structure is very solid and it’s very very protected. When you land on the given space position you are not aware of this is one of the best things to use, you are like an egg it’s too solid. But the time in development the space technology in space you have learned the star formation at this moment with the knowledge of universe it’s one of the best.<br>凯：他们用作驱动引力场和磁力场，通过旋转与控制，其处理过程很像你们现在手里有的线圈。所以你在中心有一个核心，这就是为什么我们需要核心 ，我们记得，如果你记得，我们做的铜核心。然后通过这种操作 控制就完成了，你能转向这边你就能将方向改变为那边 （箭头01:54:54），如果你向上转动，方向就会朝那边 ，向上提升；或者让它成为一条线 （中间一条线），你就可以朝向这个方向 ，这是很古老的版本，很原始的最初访问地球的宇宙飞船，用的就是这种类似的技术，而且很强大，结构很是坚固 ，防御性能很好。当你降落在太空中某个你不清楚的地点时，这个结构就很能派上用场。就像一个鸡蛋，很坚固。但是现在随着太空技术的发展星型组合这个宇宙知识目前是最好的飞船结构之一 。<br>So you can even use the same combination here. Single core, double core , double coil single core has been used extensively in the past and you still see it the primitive space use it and it’s one of the best thing to use but you can put the coil cause then now you extract the energy you want from it. You can use it as a battery it’s very powerful so you can create the what do you call it, The gans battery capacitor connected to the coil and the core and you find out that we achieve a new dimension because now the plasma of the gans is free here in the centre and the field forces of this creates rotation in the gans and you control the speed by the plasma flow so if you look at it its very much you have a core which is got a gans in it and then you have the coils which are, I put it this way on the outside the field forces from your double coil, everything has to be double you don’t use a single and then when you put your gans inside you seen this one like a ping pong ball with Rick has now this you don’t rotate it anymore in the motor system you rotate it. In this by control of the field and this you create rotation and you start creating the magnetic field and then the plasma of the 2 will become very powerful and it creates a spherical more or less egg shape but it’s a opposite, with this you have seen the up to now its very hard to make a shape like this. You make a shape like this, your spaceship will have this kind of shapes.<br>凯：你甚至可以在这里运用同样的组合结构 （星型组合的线圈里）。单个核心，双核心，双线圈单核心在人类过去被广泛的运用。你仍然会看到原始的宇宙飞船在用它，但它是最好的使用方式之一，你能放入线圈，因为你可以从中提取想要的能量，你能将它作为电池来使用，很强大，你能创建甘斯电池电容器与线圈和核心相连，你会发现我们实现了一个新的维度，因为现在中间的甘斯等离子体是自由的 ，这个场强力创造甘斯的旋转，你就能控制等离子体流动的速度，所以你如果仔细的看它，你有一个核心 ，里面有甘斯，然后你有线圈围绕周围 ，场强力来自双线圈 ，每件东西都必须是双的，不使用单线圈，然后你把甘斯放在里面，就像一个乒乓球 ，你不需要旋转它，在马达系统中，你进行旋转；而在这里，通过控制场强，你能创造旋转 ，然后你开始创造这个磁力场，以及这两个线圈形成的等离子体 ，变得十分强大，形成一个球面，像鸡蛋的形状，但是相反的，通过这个系统你目前很难做成这样的形状 ，你做成这样的形状 ，你的宇宙飞船将拥有这样的形态 。<br>[Ali]: And the core there is no core is just like a ping pong ball and the core is that right.<br>阿里：这个核心，没有核心，只是像一个乒乓球，这个核心<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes and the gans<br>凯：是的，还有甘斯<br>[Ali]; gans yeah<br>阿里：甘斯，好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Is the master of it orange he like balls<br>凯：你就能掌控它，橘子都是球形<br>[Ali]: yes of course<br>阿里：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So he made orange balls very very famous so this is the when you see it or you can see the same thing you can connect the double core to the polarity of your system and you can find a more powerful end power supply, it’s putting the thing, you can use the gans core and then the right connection you will find the different then you will find the control then you will find the power supply, I never… pardon?<br>凯：所以他制作橘色球很有名，当你看见它，或者你能看见同样的事情，你能将双线圈连接到你的系统的极性上 ，你会发现一个更强的能量输出，你能使用甘斯核心和正确的连接 ，你会发现有所不同，你会找到控制并发现能量供给。你说什么？<br>[Rick]: There is a another idea as well it just came to mind with that the rotating ping pong ball idea if you vacuum out ping pong ball like under relatively high vacuum butnot complete vacuum so there is still a little bit of air left in it and then rotate it at high spend when you put your hand on it it actually does create a plasma inside that ping pong ball and in dark you can see the purple plasma it’s an old old technique that comes from the Hackberry device back in the 1600 when they rotated a glass globe that was evacuated had a partial vacuum in it and the people would put the hands on this rotating globle  and it would create a glowing plasma that you could actually read<br>瑞克：我的脑袋里突然有了另外一个想法，就是关于这个旋转的乒乓球，如果你将乒乓球真空化，是相对高的真空，不是完全的真空，也就是留些空气在里面，然后以高速度旋转它，当你把手放在上面，就会事实上在乒乓球里面创造一个等离子体，在黑暗中你就会看见紫色的等离子体，这是一种很古老的额技术，可以追溯到1600年哈克伯里装备，当他们旋转一个玻璃球，里面被抽空，有一部分空气，人们把手放在旋转的玻璃球上，就会创造一个扩散增长中的等离子体，你可以相关文献中读到<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yeah but now you have those 2 coils which do that for you<br>凯：是的，但现在你有2个线圈来为你做这样的事<br>[Rick]; Right yeah we might be able to …<br>瑞：是的 我们或许可以<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we can track comes in … pardon?<br>凯：那更容易进来，你在说一遍<br>[Rick]: We built might be able to enter back with it as well as control systems I was thinking using the hand we can, we wouldn’t have to touch the ball just be close to it.<br>瑞克：我们可以建造同样的控制系统，我在想使用手，我们不必触碰这个球，但只需接近它。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:no  but give you you will see the spherical ball this way anyway if you do it.<br>凯：不，这给你，如果你这样做，无论哪边你都会看到这个球形结构<br>[Ali]: The idea was to use this as power force, power source for star formation so these would be the new batteries for the star formation that would give us a really powerful shield in the star formation.<br>阿里：将这个作为星型组合的能量动力，能量源，这样就会成为供给星型组合的新的电池，就会在星型组合中给我们真实而强大的磁场防护盾。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes they will do but you can do it with the core and the coil the way I showed but you will see in this condition you will see a full structure but these are very primitive, very very used millions of years ago there are extremely primitive systems you have no control there is a lot of problem with the maintaining  field strength inside its very jittery because the field within the structure is not totally covered all the time so external field, high field forces from external which is above your field inside can interfere with the system, the space ship star formation is stable because it covers in way the totality you have always treats the system covering one, if one fails but you still have your base to hold on to. Here it’s very dangerous I will put this way there has been a lot of loses in the time but it’s still used it’s a good test if you want  to test get one of your ping pong balls make sure there is nothing with it put on with huge amount of gans and put it inside the coils. None of them have to touch each other you cannot touch, You have keep them separate from each other then yes you will start the creation and one of the things will see is that you will see the shape you will see the structure but this is a very very it’s a very strange system but try it you will see it.<br>凯：是的，它们可以做到。按照我展示的你可以使用核心与线圈做到，但是你在这个条件下你会看见一个完整的结构，但这些是十分原始的，是在几百万年前被使用的，是十分原始初级的系统，没有控制系统，在维持里面的场强方面存在很大的问题，它是不稳定的，因为这个结构里面的场域不是一直覆盖着整个结构，外面的场，来自外面的处于系统里面的场强上方的高强度的场会干扰你的系统， （波浪线是外部的场强），而太空飞船星型组合是稳定的 ，因为它通过某种方式覆盖整体，从而能把这个系统作为一个整体对待，如果星型组合中一个单元不能正常运行，你还有其他组合形成的基底维持整体结构的运行 ，而这是很危险的 （中间），这样放置会产生很多的能量流失，但仍不失为一个好的测试方法，如果你想要测试的话，拿一个乒乓球，里面没有什么东西，在上面放上很多甘斯，再把它放在线圈里，它们之间不能相互接触，你也不要碰触，让它们相互之间保持距离，是的，你就会开始了创造的进程，而且其中一个能够看见的事情是你能够看到出现场的形状，看到结构，但这是很奇怪的系统，但可以试试，你会看见它<br>But as Rick said if you can create a vacuum in it you will see the same but if this process usually creates the rotation of the gans. It will be nice to use composite gans here do not rotate it where you dry slide the man if you need to but you don’t need to rotate it if he can hang it and then use a vacuum condition gas reduction gas injecction. We will show this in the gas to come and the same thing I was thinking about this, this morning going to a meeting and coming back and then we come up with these, can we do this? Yes we can. And this is what I wanted to teach today but it’s nice knowing I thought somehow you lot understand the souls will start talking and the body will follow and this is a all of you can make that home and see the first glowing light all of you who been in the, Rick said if you can make a vacuum in it and if you can make a vacuum and just add or add ganses that you can create a mixture of ganses with the rotation in it you will get it because the field flow in these 2 will create the rotation in it because it’s all plasmatic<br>凯：但正如瑞克说的如果你在里面制造真空，你会看见同样的情况，但这个过程通常会创造甘斯的旋转。在这里 （球里）放入复合的甘斯很不错，不用旋转，如果你想快速干燥，但不用旋转它，你能把它悬挂起来，然后制造真空环境，让气体出来，或气体进入。我们会展示这个技术，今天早上我去开会然后回来，在思考这同样的问题，我们能够做这个吗？是的，我们能。这就是今天我想要教的，很高兴知道（有人说出来了），我认为你们或多或少会知道：如果灵魂开始产生意向，身体就会相应的改变以遵循这个意向。这是你们每一个人在家里都能做的，可以看到第一道光。你们所有人都在，如瑞克说的，如果你能在里面制造真空，如果你能制造真空，并加上复合甘斯，你能创造具有旋转性质的复合甘斯组合，你就会产生光与场，因为在水平线圈与垂直线圈里创造的场流会制造里面的旋转，因为这全是等离子体的。<br>[Rick]: I think the vacuum  and gans will be really good combination to free up the gans and allow tit to move it the way we want to in that space<br>瑞克：我认为真空以及甘斯是一个很好的组合，这个组合可以释放甘斯，并允许我们到想要在太空中去的位置。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; it will do better than that you watch. I know Rick will be at it he doesn’t get much time to sleep but maybe by Tuesday you will see one. Marco please lock up the lab don’t let the Almin in it because he will…Armin has everything in the lab to be able to do this.<br>凯：想好就动手做吧。我知道瑞克在从事这个研究，他经常没有睡多长时间，可能是因为星期二的教学。马可，请锁好实验室的门，别让阿曼进去，因为他会…..阿曼在实验室有他所需要的一切来做这个事情。<br>[Ali]: The other thing I was thinking about was that human body has a chakra system or energy centres and similar the nine coils in the middle or 12 coils we have you know number of charged chakras so if you sit the middle of a triangle the star formation even without the middle coils we sit in the middle then we project three type of as you said and emotions or something are not…<br>阿里：另一件事情是我在想人体有脉轮系统或者所说的能量穴位，就像在中间的9个线圈或12个线圈，我们知道很多有充能效果的脉轮，所以如果你坐在三角形的中间，或者说星型组合的中间，即使没有中心的线圈，我们坐在里面，然后我们就能构建三种像你所说的情感，或一些….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: stop talking, you post teaching<br>凯：停止，你是在剧透<br>[Ali]: okay<br>阿里：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Now I tell you what happens in the star formation you have the 3 reactors knowing that there made of the gans doesn’t matter if you made the coils yourself. You put the reactor here on the top to make the full star formation you still can do that you can do the same by setting your star formation and put a human body inside looking at this is upright this is the fourth , if you look as to this way that you can see It you have your 3 reactors and we see the man here in the centre of it, If you look up as it comes to you, your head your brain which is made of the gans is become the 4th reactor and through it you can control the your chakras you understand? So you can put this is why I can never remember the guy’s name on Tuesday but I said to put his head on it, what his name.<br>凯史：我来告诉你发生的是什么，在星型组合中你有三个反应器 ，你要知道它们是由甘斯制作的，与你自己制作的线圈没有什么关系。你把一个反应器放在顶部 ，从而形成一个完整的星型组合 ，你也能那样做，通过制作一个星型组合，然后把人体放在里面 （中间是人体），中间的人体是直立，是第四个反应器；如果你看这样，你有三个反应器 ，然后人体在中间 ，如果从朝向你的方向来看，由甘斯形成的你的头部就作为第四个反应器 ，通过它你就能控制你的脉轮 ，明白了吗？所以你就为什么可以这样，我不记得星期二教学中那个人的名字，但是我说把头放在上面。他的名字叫什么？<br>[Rick]; Carsol I think it was<br>瑞克：考萨，我认为<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Carsol, so what happened because your brain is made of the gans material itself and with operation of these you become part of the structure. You don’t need to build the 3 pyramids. You can become this is one of the ways to control bring the control systems in flight and when you move out you don’t have the control that is why you hand over controls. You sit within the structure of the plasma which creates the spaceship as part of it you sit in the centre of it. That’s where you find what you call captains his head his brain is part of the structure within the perimeter and that’s how he becomes the controller he decides his awareness controls he see he decides and his emotion dictates the fields and the operation of the motion.<br>凯：考萨。所发生的是，因为你的大脑是由甘斯材料组成的，在基底是三个反应器的作用下你就会成为结构的一部分 。你不需要建构这三个金字塔（树状反应器） ，你能成为它，这是进行控制并把控制系统带入飞行中的一种方法。当你走出来时，你就不进行控制了，这也就是你如何进行控制。你坐在等离子体的结构中，这就创造了一个飞船 ，你坐在中间 （中心实点），这里就是你所说的首领（船长）的头脑 （实心圈的上面圈）是边界内结构的一部分，这就是他如何成为控制者，他能够决定，通过自己的意识进行控制，他看见，并进行控制，他的情感决定场流，和对运动的操控 。<br>And that is what we saw on Tuesday the guy makes a system and I have told him this is the instantaneous control now you can do it in a much easier way when you set up your reactor condition you setup your what you call the captain for your controller at a point that the position of his sitting is in a position of interaction which is emotion and thoughts decide the ship the direction and motion or you place a motor control in that position that is in fact the other ones. This is instantaneous wireless communication with your flight system, you don’t need a stick you don’t need a joystick you don’t need anything. If you decide with his thought that he wants to open his door way for entry it will be opened up that way because he creates the entrance. These are the structures that we will teach as we come to it.<br>凯：这是我们在星期二教学中所看到的，那个人制作了一个系统，我告诉他那是一个即时控制系统，现在你可以很简单的方式去做，当你设置好你的反应器结构，然后在一个点设置好你们说的船长作为控制者，他在其中所坐的位置是能进行互动的位置 ，从而通过情感与意念决定飞船的方向与运动，或者你在那个位置再放置一个控制者用来控制 。这是即时的无线的通讯和飞行系统，你不需要棍子，不需要操纵杆，你不需要其他任何东西。如果你决定，他想要打开一扇门让你进来，就会这样出现一个入口 ，因为他创造了这个入口。这就是我们即将教授给你们的结构。<br>So your what you call the star formation within the star formation within it because it’s made of one you control the whole thing without even touching anything you don’t need you don’t have a control panel but then you have you train people who the extension is in the direction of protection you don’t have a what do you call it, people looking for things they work in the same way with land understanding in the environment it’s of the control system or protection and direction of motion which show you we will bring in as we go. You don’t build the control system you build a system that by structure you control it through your thoughts you don’t create anything else with it. So what we seen on the extension of the knowledge on Sunday we as I said you bring I teach now you set your man here and in that he will control the craft because he is part of it and if you get your structure of your space ship he control through that structure of the craft and you get full condition reception. In a very very old system they used to put emotional system in the middle of the reactors I will teach you how to make emotional system that you communicate with. There is a reactor which only reacts to emotion in the old system not used much in space this is old fashioned buy it can make it but you place it like the brain of the man in the centre of the structure and through it you control the physical structure of the craft speeds and everything else a bit it’s a very very small it’s a pin head it’s a very small system you put in the center if you go back to the structure of the reactor which we made from the energy we all are already planted within it’s a very tint thing people in the Soncino have seen it in there if brace the emotional fields and then it controls the gravitational and magnetical field.<br>凯：所以你的星型组合，在星型组合里面，在它里面，因为它是形成一个整体，你可以控制这个整体而不需要接触任何东西，你不需要，你也不需要一个控制面板，你要训练人们，这个延伸是一种保护的方向 （外面弧线），你没有，人们在追寻一些事情，在陆地的环境中以同样的方式工作，这是控制与保护的系统以及控制运动的方向，这些我都会展示给你看。你不是在建造一个系统，你是在建造一个通过你的意念来进行控制的结构，你没有创造任何其他的事情。所以就像我们在星期天的教学扩展中所说的，你带来了，我就开始教，你在这里面放置了一个人 （中间是人），他能控制这个飞船，因为他是其中的一部分，如果你得到了这个飞船的结构 ，他能通过这个飞船的结构来进行控制，你就会得到一个完全的保护场 （大圈）；在很早很早的系统中，他们常把情感的系统放在这些反应器的中间 ，我将会教你如何制作用来沟通的情感系统，在很老的系统中有一个只与情感发生反应的反应器，在太空中用的不多，是比较老的版本，但你可以制作它，你可以将它放置在像人脑的结构中心 ，通过它你就能控制飞船结构的物理部分 ，如速度或其他的。它很小很小，一个小尖头，是很小的一个系统，你把它放在中间。如果我们回到制造能量的反应器结构中，我们都在里面植入这个东西 ，是很小的一个东西，在松奇诺的人可能见过它，它支撑起情感场 ，然后控制磁力场与引力场。<br>[Danny]: Hi Mr. Keshe this is Danny I am from America from Idaho and I just want to interrupt you some moment not because it’s something made or not it’s just that since you having the star formation can you use for people we got one person for the head why can’t you have 3 people for this reactors.<br>丹尼：你好，凯史先生。我说丹尼，来自美国爱达华州，我打断您一下，因为我们制作了一些东西，自从您教导这个星型组合后，你说将一个人的头部放在装置上，那么是否能将三个人代替这些反应器呢？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes you can.<br>凯：是的，你能。<br>[Danny]: Thank you<br>丹尼：谢谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; I hope you understand what we are talking about.<br>凯：我希望你明白我们在谈论什么<br>[Danny]: well maybe somebody will. Thanks.<br>丹尼：恩，某人会的。谢谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: human being brains is one of the best sources of gans if you could establish the same formation we talked then it’s all of the same yes we can achieve most of the passengers of the space travel in 4. Any other question?<br>凯：不谢。人类的大脑是最好的甘斯能源之一，如果你能建立我们谈论的组合 ，是完全一样的，是的，你能实现，大多数太空旅行者都是4人一组旅行的 。其他问题？<br>[Rick]: we have a Miguel who wanted to add to the teaching because he has we wants to share some information with the team he says so perhaps we can hear what he has to say. Miguel are you there, I see your microphone is open but I cannot hear anything.<br>瑞克：米格尔想要说一些什么，他和他的团队想要分享一些信息，所以，或许我们能听听他要说什么，米格尔你在那里吗？我看见你的麦克风的开的，但我不能听见什么。<br>[Miguel]: yes hello<br>米：在，你们好<br>[Rick]: hi<br>瑞克：你好<br>[Jackie]; Its Jackie from Switzerland<br>杰克：我是来自瑞士的杰克<br>[Rick]: wait a minute Jackie I am trying to get through to Miguel<br>瑞克：等一下，杰克。我们现在正在与米格尔联络<br>[Jackie]: No problem<br>杰克：好的<br>[Rick]: Miguel are you going to speak your microphone is open but is, I don’t hear anything you should have your microphone turned on, this is, okay lets. I am not hearing from you Miguel you going to fix your microphone situation. Okay well that’s go on to Jackie, Jackie also has something to show I believe a reactor combination or shall we see if there is any question first on that previous teaching. Is there anyone that has any question or anything at the moment that is in the panellist about that.<br>瑞克：米格尔你能去查看一些你的耳机是否是开的，我听不见任何东西，你应该把你的麦克风打开，这是，我来看看。我仍然听不见你的声音，你查看一下你的麦克风的状况。好吧，我们联系杰克吧，杰克也有一些东西要展示出来，我相信是一个反应器组合，在教学之前在视屏名单中是否还有其他人有问题？<br>[Maser]: Do you hear me now, my name is Maser Rasheed I have a question.<br>马塞尔：能听见我妈？我叫马塞尔，我有一个问题<br>[Rick]: Okay can you speak up a bit there its very faint<br>瑞克：好的，你的声音能提高一点吗，这里听起来很微弱<br>[Maser]: Is this better?<br>马塞尔：好点了吗？<br>[Rick]: Okay yes thank you<br>瑞克：好的，感谢<br>[Maser]]: The star formation look like somebody sitting like in lotus position is that any relationship with that?<br>马塞尔：这个星型组合看起来就像是某个人在打坐（莲花坐，禅坐），这之间有什么联系吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No, not as far as I know.<br>凯：没有，至少我不知道<br>[Rick]: knees and brains are different I guess different kind of gans. okay so Jackie did you have something to present there now?<br>瑞克：膝盖与大脑是不同的，我猜。呵呵。不同种类的甘斯。好的，杰克，你那里有什么要展示的吗？<br>[Jackie]: Yeah, yes sir<br>杰克：是的，先生。<br>[Rick]: Okay go ahead I will turn on your video there.<br>瑞克：好的，我马上打开你那里的视屏<br>[Jackie]: Okay thank you very much I just show you the new system it’s the old but I put…<br>杰克：好，很感谢。我想要展示我的新系统，这是比较老式的，但我把…..<br>[Rick]: First could you tell us where you are from?<br>瑞克：首先，你能告诉我们你来自哪里吗？<br>[Jackie]: Yeah I am from Switzerland<br>杰克：好，我来自瑞士<br>[Rick]: Thank you<br>瑞克：谢谢<br>[Jackie]: And just 2 things I put my new battery like within next week’s it’s the new one with the C gans all of it and then I connect on the earth the other part  that I just make my new coils that we see on Thursday and this is one things but I realize another things is I connect 2 of the Magrav in Switzerland and now I just realized that all the Magrav connect together and my new star formation it’s like 20 or 30 km because the old unit can connect together and communicate it’s like instant communication so now I can be in one place or in another place because I have the connection with the other Magrav and I can control the fields  like gravitational or magnetical what I realized it’s something if you want to go up you need to give more and if you want to stay on earth you need to take more so I just decide to take a little bit and give a lot lot lot and its why I establish this company to make stuff to produce Magrav now in Switzerland we can make a lot of Magrav and I go in Paris to make a seminar for 3 days and we have 20 people who will be there and go back in the house with the 20 Magravs<br>杰克： 2件事情，我把我的新电池，用了几个星期，是新式电池都涂上C甘斯，然后我连接到地面 ，另外一部分我用的是新线圈，是星期二教学里讲的，这是一件事，我意识到另一件事是我在瑞士连接2个磁引力场装置，现在我意识到所有的磁引力场都连接在一起了，我的新的星型组合是大概20到30米远，原来旧的装置能够与其联系在一起，而且能够沟通，就像即时的通讯沟通，所以现在我能在一个地方或者另一个地方，因为我与磁引力场有连接，我能控制磁场，像引力或者磁力，我意识到：如果你想要上升，你就需要给予的多，如果你要呆在地面上，你就需要接收的多。所以我决定获取一点点，而给予很多很多很多，这就是为什么我建立这个公司制作磁引力场，现在在瑞士我能制作大量的磁引力场，我到巴黎去参加为期3天的研讨会，在那里我们有20个人，然后给每一个人带一个磁引力场装置回家。（02:19:16）<br> so after when you have a star formation with a lot of Magrav we communicate together and you make the connection with the Magrav and the spirit of all the person who are connected with this you realize that life is beautiful and everything is connected, the yeah you have the tool to create a better planet and make a big ship for humanity you know it’s, when you understand you need to, you don’t need a lot we just need some you can food with the cup of life you can, I make in my home my Magrav cup so I take less fuel and yeah its miracle every day. Life becomes beautiful I follow the teaching in the university Keshe and everyday it’s like a mind blowing experience all the life looks different and its more bright and everything and you can ask everything you know you have the control of all your life you decide what you want and since appears. Mr. Keshe give us the like another lump it’s a, you decide and help you ask and you receive and when you start to give to the other people and yeah it’s like magic and life becomes totally different and I have no word I have no words it’s like a dream it’s the life I imagine for since I was born but now it’s become reality so it’s incredible thanks to Mr. Keshe to give this opportunity and we need to take responsibility with humanity and just realize I am the humanity it’s the plasma of humanity we just need to connect together and make one and make the fly to go back home like what we are so the unit, so it’s my story and yeah it’s what I think now.<br>杰克：所以之后我们有很多很多的磁引力场装置形成星型组合，我们故能联系在一起，你能与磁引力场装置联系在一起，以及与磁引力场连接在一起的人们的灵魂连接在一起，我们意识到生活是美妙的，所有的事情是连接在一起的，是的，我们有这个能创造更美好的地球的工具，并能为人类建造宇宙飞船，你知道，你需要，你不需要很多，只是需要，你能把食物放在生命之杯里，你能，我制作出了我的磁引力场杯子，于是我获取很少很少很少的能量，是的，每天都是一个奇迹。生活变得很美妙，我紧随凯史先生的教学，每天，感觉思维与意识都在爆炸与扩展，所有的生命看起来是如此不同，变得更加明亮了。你能问你知道的所有事情，你能够掌控你的生活，你决定你想要什么，自从凯史先生给予我们，就像另一个肺部，你决定无论什么，你要求的，你接收的，当你开始将其给予他人时，是的，就像魔法一样，生活变得完全不同了，无法用语言描述，就像梦幻一般，自从我出生后的向往与想象的生活，现在变得触手可及。所以这是难以置信的，感谢你，凯史先生，给予我们这个机会。我们需要为人类承担起责任，我意识到我是人类，一个人的等离子体，我们需要连接联合在一起，形成一个整体，一个一。然后制造飞船飞回家，就像我们原来的一样，就像这个装置，这就是我的故事，是我现在所想的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can I ask you a question?<br>凯：我能问一个问题吗？<br>[Jackie]: yes<br>杰克：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you tell us in because you said with your car what is your change in your car.<br>凯：你能告诉我们，因为你说到你的汽车，你对你的汽车做了什么改变？<br>[Jackie]: It’s totally different all the mass of the cars become different, all the, it becomes totally plasmatic you know and when you drive you feel the energy of the car and its like you don’t go against the resistance it’s like you are attracted but it’s only 2 weeks but and …<br>杰克：变得完全不同了，汽车的整体的重量感变得不一样了。它变得等离子体化，当你驾驶的时候，你感觉到的是汽车的能量，就像，你不需要去对抗阻力，就好像你是被吸引的，但这只是2个星期，而且<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Is there any change in the consumption?<br>凯：油耗有什么改变吗？<br>[Jackie]: Yeah absolutely its 5 I don’t know 50% less<br>杰克：是的，肯定的，我不知道，50%左右<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I tell you a news I would like, are you driving with the your car to Paris?<br>凯：我告诉你一个信息，你是开车去巴黎吗？<br>[Jackie]: yes<br>杰克：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay I organise for you what type of car do you have?<br>凯：好的，我为你组织一个事情，你的汽车是什么牌子的？<br>[Jackie]: It’s an old Toyota, Toyota Yaris<br>杰克：是很老的Toyota，Toyota Yaris<br>[Mr. Keshe]; What I would like to do with you I organise it for you immediately. When you go to Paris you go to Peugeot headquarters you meet with the head of Peugeot research he has some 800 researchers on his control. We organise it for you with direct contact while you go to Paris you can give your car to them and arrange that Peugeot will give you a brand new Peugeot back home.<br>凯：我想为你做的是，我立刻为你组织一下，当你去巴黎时，你去标致总部，与标致研究中心的负责人见面，他手下有800个研究员，我们为你组织这次直接的见面，当你去巴黎时，你把你的汽车交给他们，我们安排，标致公司给你一辆崭新品牌的标致车开回来。<br>[Jackie]; okay<br>杰克：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]; leave the car with Peugeot these are the people we work and in the background we research with<br>凯：把汽车交给标致公司。他们是我们在背后一起合作并研发的人。<br>[Jackie]: Okay<br>杰克：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I would like to organise for you if he can that by the tell go back on the website to Mike Nasser and then I will make a call, while you are on the line let me make a call, carry on talking and see if we can deliver the car to Peugeot for you. When are you there which date?<br>凯：是我们来安排这件事，到那时你告诉他们，你回到网站上，当你在线上时我给你打电话，让我来打电话，一直保持通话，看是否我们能为你把车交给标致。你下次什么时候去巴黎？<br>[Jackie]; I go tomorrow from Friday to Monday.<br>杰克：我明天去，从星期五到星期一<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay let me organise it that fast just carry on talking if I can when you go to Paris or not you can go the week after. You take your car you leave your car with Peugeot head of research at Peugeot international they will take over your car or we ask them to give a call for a curtesy at least you don’t have a car back and let them run the car.<br>凯：好的，让我们尽快组织这个事情，请不要下线，如果我能，当你去巴黎，或者下个星期。你开上你的车，将你的车交给标致研究中心负责人，他们会接管你的车，我们会要他们给你一辆新的车，至少你能开车回来，让他们接收你的车<br>[Jackie]: okay<br>杰克：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Just carry on talking I will have to make a telephone call just carry on talking a bit.<br>凯：请保持在线，我要去接一个电话，请保持在线<br>[Jackie]; Okay<br>杰克：好<br>[Rick]: Hello Jackie someone is asking is asking Esther is asking what type of system did you build in your car?<br>瑞克：你好，杰克。有人在问，阿夏在问你的车里建造了什么样的系统？<br>[Jackie]: It’s the same like the Magrav for house and I have the 3 stacker and I put in the back I have a connection in the mass of the car and the other cable goes to the plus of battery and on it it’s a, it’s the mix of the 3 ganses I put on the coil and I have some CO2 gans in the tank I put the 50ml of CO2 gans in it and I have one trick from me I have small things like that if you can see, in it I put some it’s like the pen, it’s like the pen I have the coil and after I have magnetic gravitational that I put some ganses in it and I plug into the alume cigar I don’t know in English the plug in the car<br>杰克：就像为房里电网提供能量的能量盒，我放了3个能量盒在车子的后面，我在汽车里面进行了连接，一根线连接到电池的插口，我把3种混合的甘斯放在线圈上，我把一些CO2甘斯放入油箱，放了50ML的CO2甘斯，我做了一个小的东西 ，你看，我放了一些，像一支笔，线圈在里面，就有了磁引力场，我把一些甘斯放在里面，我把它插入雪茄口里，我不知道用英语怎么说，在汽车里的一个插口<br>[Ali]: The cigarette lighter<br>阿里：点烟器<br>[Jackie]: yeah exactly and I can manage with these things I can manage to put a lot of different ganses to have different interaction between the plasma and I change the energy of the car with the plasma I put on this.<br>杰克：是的，我用大量不同的甘斯处理它，用以在等离子体之间形成不同的互动，我用等离子体改变了汽车的能量形式，就是把这个插上去<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do you mind what I am going to do with you Jackie we will try to get you directly to Peugeot visit the people who we have the work in the background after the meeting we had this morning the guy who is responsible so he is not very far from me I am trying to raise he is in another meeting so we organise you we try to organise that if not this week then sometime next week. Peugeot will accept your car we don’t need on the test you can stay with them let me see what I can do for you and because we were discussing this, this morning in respect to or we take your Peugeot to Peugeot Iran because Peugeot is opened a factory back in Iran for test. Okay. Let me see what I can do I can’t get him just one second. Jackie just wait online because this can be done if I can get hold of him.<br>凯：你不介意的话，我要对你做的是，我们会让你直接接触标致，去拜访那些人，他们是在后台一直与我们一起合作的。今早的会议结束后，这个负责的人离我不远，我试图接触他，他在另一个会议上，所以我们组织，我们试着为你安排，如果不是这个星期就是下个星期某些时候。标致会接收你的汽车，我们不需要测试，你能与他们呆在一起，让我看看我能为你做什么，因为我们今早在讨论这个事情，我们把标致带入伊朗，因为标致在伊朗要开工厂来进行测试。好的。让我看看。我能做什么。我不能联系上他，稍等。杰克，保持在线，因为这个能够完成，如果我能联系到他。<br>[Danny]; Thank you Jackie that really helps me as well I have just been using one stack and have about 15% and so I will add 2 more thank you very much I appreciate it.<br>丹尼：很感谢，杰克。这真的很能帮助到我，我一直都是用的一个能量盒，节省15%的能耗，所以我准备再加2个能量盒，很感谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do you want to explain you configuration please Jackie, can you draw it for us.<br>凯：你能够解释一下你的结构吗，杰克，你能为我们画出来吗？<br>[Jackie]: Yeah it’s really simple it’s the Magrav stacker like the Magrav stacker and it’s the same connection and is in the back in my car and one connection its in the mass I put in the mass of the car and I the other wire go in the plus of the battery its like easy.<br>杰克：是的，很简单，就是磁引力场装置，是一样的连接，就在汽车的后面。一个连接是在汽车里，连到汽车的总质量；另一线连接到电池插口，很简单<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can you repeat again what you said?<br>凯：你能重复一下你说的吗？<br>[Jackie]: yeah I have the 3 stacker in the back of the gans . I take a wire and I connect to the mass of the car and the other…<br>杰克：好，我有3个能量盒放在甘斯后面，我其中一条线连接到汽车的总质量，另一条<br>[Mr. Keshe]: One second let me do the call<br>凯：等一下，让我打这个电话<br>[Jackie]: Yeah the ground.<br>杰克：是的，地线<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah Renon, Renon is Renon online.<br>凯：雷农，雷农你在线吗<br>[Renon]: I am here sir.<br>雷农：我在<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can you speak with the, oh the flagship of the Keshe foundation good morning.<br>凯：你能和，哦，凯史基金会的旗舰，早上好<br>[Renon]: good morning sir<br>雷农：早，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: good morning, Renon can you speak with Jackie and get a drawing of it and put it in the blueprint<br>凯：早。雷农你能与杰克联系上吗，从他那里得到一张图画，放在蓝图里<br>[Renon]: Yes sir I will contact him, Jackie can you leave a private message or your email.<br>雷：好的。我会联系他。杰克，你能给我发私人信息吗，或者邮件<br>[Jackie]: okay<br>杰克：好的<br>[Renon]: Thank you Jackie. Ok Vince I will just ask email from Jackie so we can contact it.<br>雷：谢谢，杰克。好，文斯，我向杰克那里要邮件，这样我们可以相互联系<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do it in the background. Wait I have to make this call I am going to silence and discuss so it doesn’t cause problem. Yes good morning my name is Keshe speaking we had the meeting this morning I have a car which can be delivered to Peugeot sometime this weekend could you please call me back to organise it to end of research and the car can be left in Paris coming from Switzerland thank you very much bye. I can’t get the guy on the phone sorry my open my microphone. I try to organise it for you that by the time you go to Paris if we see we can come to an agreement with Peugeot to give you another car that they can test your car on mine and then we send you up to Volkswagen. Volkswagen in Germany then we will be setup to test the car afterwards so because you have a working system they want to see your work syeterm t it can be evolved in the structure so we make sure you get your car back like this Peugeot will give you a new car.  one back from Volkswagen. So I get to work with the people in background people who have that kind of work so now you speak that you are going to Paris and just this morning breakfast time you had meeting regarding this because we have access because you literally walk into Peugeot you see the head of Peugeot you hand your car over and then we can see organise you go back with the car but this time you will pay for fuel I hope not but we will see what we can do. Vince and you keep a line of contact that we can sort out with this today afterward because I know there are in a meeting after this in Dubai. Thanks Jackie<br>凯：在后台做。等一下，我要打这个电话，我将静音，这就不会造成问题。(通话中）是的，早上好，我的名字是凯史，今早我们一起开过会，我有一辆车在这个星期某些时候能够送到标致，你能回个电话以便安排这件事情，将汽车送到研究中心，这是一辆来自瑞士的车会留在巴黎，十分感谢，再见。我打电话是来电提醒，抱歉。我打开了麦克风。我会为你安排，你就去巴黎，看是否我们能和标致达成一致见解，给你另一新的汽车，他们就能够测试你的车，然后我们送你去大众，德国大众，我们会参与到大众车的测试，因为你有一个工作系统，他们会想要看你的这个工作系统，用来改进他们汽车的结构，我们会确保你从标致得到一辆新车，还有从大众那里得到一辆。所以我们在和那些背后的做这些工作的人一起合作，你讲到你去巴黎，今早早餐时我有一个关于这件事的会议，因为我有权限，你可以直接去见标致的总裁，交出你的车，我们能安排，然后你带着新车回去，但你德为你的油费付账了，我希望不会。我们会做好我们该做的。文斯，你保持在线的联系，我们能够整理出今天的东西因为我知道随后在迪拜有一次会议。谢谢你，杰克。<br>[Jackie]: Thank you very much<br>杰克：很感谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: so we will give you a car today motor in the street to check they know all the specs of these cars and they wanted to run it and if it works correctly then you will find the we can go to the next step back to same measurement. Yes please go ahead but I have tried to organise this but we are through putting touch with me I give you all the details where you got to go to Paris and you need to speak and hand your car over.<br>凯：所以我们会给你一辆新车，发动机他们回去测试检查，他们知道这些汽车所有的参数与规格，他们想要运行一下，如果工作正常，你会发现，我们能够走向下一步，进行同样的检测。是的，请继续，我们会安排这件事情，让它成行，保持与我联系。我给你所有细节，你去巴黎，你需要讲话，并移交你的汽车。<br>[Jackie]: okay definitely thank you.<br>杰克：好的，当然，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay.<br>凯：谢谢<br>[Jackie]: yes so what I use I just want to take what I use because its already exist its Magrav power schematics a bit you have a car connection Magrav power for vehicle direct connection so it’s what, it’s the think. It’s  just this document I use for the connection which is exactly like this then I have the 3 stacker connection to the I don’t know the mass, you said the ground. On the ground the plus of the Magrav goes to the plus of the battery and then I put I some CO2 gans liquid washes so only the water of the CO gans wash in the tank fuel tank I put 50ml of this water in the tank fuel and then in the cigar lighter I put something like that where in it I open these kind of this so and then I put some coils in it and it’s like just under wire then I have magnetic and gravitational coils together I put in the back some paper some tissue paper with some ganses and then I just plug in the cigar, alume cigar and in this, sorry. Yeah okay and this type of container you can put every gans you want so if you to put some tomato gans if you are angry or if you want to put some zinc for the emotional or all the different type of ganses you can imagine you know and you have an interaction because with this plasma and the plasma in the magrav in your so you have different so you have communication between and your car is plasmatic so you have transfer of energy of what you want it’s like my concept and what I realize its new it’s only 2 weeks I ran with the car but it’s a beautiful experience and something really really good so you know it’s an old car so the ground was a little bit old and when you wash the car the system residual you can’t wash you put some water and oh goes yeah because the particle can’t attach to the ground so everything is like a new car.<br>杰克：是的，我所用的，因为它已经存在，是磁引力场能量装置原理图，你有一个磁引力场能量装置与汽车的连接图，这就是的 ，我用这个文件所指示的进行连接，我有3个能量盒，连接到，总质量，你们所说的接地端，磁引力场装置的正极连接到电池接口，然后我把一些CO2甘斯洗净液（不是甘斯），只是CO2甘斯洗净液，放入油箱，50ML放入其中，在点烟器接口我插入这样的东西 ，我将它打开 ，我放了线圈在里面，磁力线圈与引力线圈在一起，在后面我放一些涂有甘斯的面纸，然后将其插入点烟口。好的，这种种类的容器 ，你可以放入你想要的任何甘斯，如果你生气放入西红柿甘斯，或者放入对应情感部分的锌甘斯，或者其他你能想到的不同种类的甘斯，你就有了互动，因为这个容器形成的等离子体与前面的等离子体还有磁引力场装置形成的等离子体之间有一个互动，和连接，这样你的汽车就是等离子体了，你能够转换你需要的任何能量。这是我的概念，这需要继续测试，因为我只是运行了2个星期。是的，这是很美妙的经验，还有很好很不错的事情。这是一个旧车，它的排放系统有一些旧，当你洗车时，系统会出来一些残留物，你不能洗，因为颗粒物不能接触到排放系统，这完全看起来像一个新车。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay can I come in Jackie I understand you are trying to explain. We know that the cause which should be added or touched the Magrav system show these kind of properties that even they see  rust disappears on the car. Am I correct?<br>凯：好的，我能插话吗？我明白你在试图解释清楚。我们知道原因应该被解释，磁引力场装置展示出这些性能，他们甚至看见汽车上的锈都消失了。对吗？<br>[Jackie]: yes exactly<br>杰克：是 正是这样。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So we know because you become part of it so we know that people report, is Reny online he can tell you more he is a master of these things.<br>凯：我们知道，因为你已经成为其中一部分，我们看见人们报告相关的事情，瑞尼在线吗？他能告诉你更多，他对这些事情很在行<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Just communicate with him he will tell you more, yeah yeah yeah okay thank you very much. He is a teacher in the structure of the Keshe foundation. Renon is Reny online?<br>凯：联系他，他会告诉你更多，是的，是的，很感谢。他凯史基金会的老师。雷农，瑞尼在线吗？<br>[Renon]; I think Reny was online I while ago but he left already buy an hour ago.<br>雷农：我认为瑞尼在线，但恐怕他一个小时之前已经离开了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay because he has a good experience with these things. Alex can tell you too the same. Okay carry on because when you  usually tells a lot of things but they notice him and. Do you feel anything in the power of the car? Has it got more powerful?<br>凯：好。因为他对这些事情很有经验。阿历克斯也能告诉你更多这样的事情。好，继续。因为你常常讲述很多事情，他们注意到他。你感觉到汽车动力有什么不一样吗？是否更加有力了？<br>[Jackie]: yeah you can if you are in the 2nd or 3rd you can start in 2nd or 3rd wheel, gear. And it’s like it’s more stable you have constant flow of power you don’t have a all you know its constant and you have no…<br>杰克：是的，因为你挂到2档或者3档，2档或3档的齿轮，就像更加稳定了，能量输出持续稳定，你没有一碰一碰的感觉，而是很平稳平顺。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You are not the one who first to talk about,<br>凯：你不是第一个这么说的人<br>[Jackie]: Yeah exactly<br>杰克：是的，当然<br>[Rick]: it sounds more like the wouship works instead of the big bang happening in the, like Mr. Keshe talked about one he said big works not the big bang<br>瑞克：这听起来就像嗡嗡声代替当当响，就像凯史先生讲过的大爆炸，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do you, now we going to ask you a funny question do you feel the steering is easier to handle?<br>凯：现在我们问你一个有趣的问题，你觉得你的方向盘更容易操控吗？<br>[Jackie]: The steering excuse me?<br>杰克：麻烦您再说一遍？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Steering it’s not so hard it’s not like you are not driving on the land.<br>凯：方向盘操作不吃力，就好像你不是在陆地上开车一样<br>[Jackie]: Yeah exactly and it’s really strange reaction on the road so suddenly you, it’s not you don’t drive the same you feel it’s like you need to learn to drive because it’s a different driving, its sounds strange reaction on the road.<br>杰克：是的。在路上是很奇怪的反应，很突然，就像你不是在开车，你感觉你需要重新学习驾驶，因为是一种不同的驾驶感觉，在路上声音听起来很奇怪<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay I tell you now as we said now we going to more in detail what you said just add to your knowledge. What happens when you produce these kind of Magrav system is there is a car in Philippine which they try to run it without the engine. Renon do you want to tell us a little bit more about this?<br>凯：好。我现在告诉你，就像我说的，现在我们释放更多的关于你说的知识与细节。发生的是，当你制造这些磁引力场系统，有一个汽车在菲律宾，他们试图在没有引擎的情况下驱动它。雷农，你愿意告诉我们关于这件事更多的情况吗？<br>[Renon]: Yes sir about the car system what we have experienced here especially with my car its already an 8 year old car and the difference is it has like a brand new engine and basically you can know that your combustion or what going to the exhaust there is water dripping in your exhaust that’s what we can also see here so you can get water so have not test yet what water, what the component of the water that’s dripping from our combustion exhaust or the muffler exhaust so but there is water coming out but you really feel that the car is very strong and also the saving that I have with a small setup with a few single core, single Magrav coil and some extensions I get an average right now since 5 months 6 months ago at 25% of fuel usage with my city driving. So its just near drive not long drive. So if your setup I think the position of the Magrav at back of the car and connecting it not directly to the negative and connecting it to the body of the car can be possibly it’s a good way to distribute the plasma from the back to the front because we understood that the car engine is already has, there is burning so plasma so it will be, once the energy is there so the whole plasma from front and back are interacting together so is that big difference than setting up in front. So I think we can test that 2 Magravs in front of the car and at the back of the car may have a better, a different result.<br>雷：是的，先生。关于这个汽车的系统，我们所体验到的是，我们汽车已经有8年了，不同的是它好像还是像一个崭新的引擎，而且基本上你能知道你的燃烧，或者什么进入到排气装置里，在你的排气装置里有水在滴，这就是我们仍然能够看见的，所以你能得到水，还没有测试是什么水，水里什么成分，从我们的排气燃烧装置或者排气静音装置里滴水，有水出来，但是你真实的感受到汽车更有力了，而且在节省能源，我们有一些小的设置，小的单核心，单个的磁引力场线圈，还有一些扩展，我是从5个月或6个月前开始装上的，有25%的能量节省，在城市的道路上驾驶，只是在附近驾驶，不是远途驾驶。所以你的设置，我认为在汽车后面的磁引力场装置的位置，将它不是直接连接到负极，你可以将它与汽车整体连接在一起，可能是一种很好的方法，能够将等离子体从后部分配到前部，因为我们理解到汽车引擎已经燃烧得完全等离子体化了，一旦能量在那里，这整个等离子体从前部到后部能够在一起相互作用，所有这是很大的不同比起单独设置在前部。所以我认为可以同时测试在前部的磁引力场装置以及后面的磁引力场装置，这样或许更好，会有不同的效果。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We, can I add to this Renon please. We know this happens and that’s why the car Magrav system will receive from the manufacturers of the Keshe foundation have a long piece of wire to move away from the motor to the further back. We seen with the test show this at if you distribute the Margrave system in the back or in the butt and you can connect it to the battery and it makes a big difference so it comes from what you both are telling us.<br>凯：我们，我能加一点吗？雷农。我们知道这样所发生的，这就是为什么从凯史基金会工厂那里接受到的磁引力场系统有一条长的线从发动机到更靠后的位置。我们看见测试所展示的，如果你将磁引力场分配到后部或者插入点烟器，同时你也可以将它连接到电池，这样会形成一个很大的不同，所以结果需要你们来告诉我们。<br>[Danny]: May I ask Jackie about, did he put the CO2 gans inside of a container when he put it in his gas tank?<br>丹尼：我能向杰克问一个问题吗，他是将容器里甘斯放入到汽油箱的吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]; No he put the water, water no the CO2. People have put the CO2 in the cars and cars have all stopped. Hello?<br>凯：不，他是用水，水，不是CO2，人们把CO2放入汽车里，汽车就停止了。<br>[Danny]: Yes,<br>丹尼：在<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay carry on. So let me explain to you I just add the knowledge because Renon is off. We have seen collectively from other places these are people who drive car they report a lot of them softer handling is that the same with you?<br>凯：好，继续。让我继续向你解释我刚才说的知识，因为雷农已经下线了。我们看见来自其他地方很多这样的报告，他们说驾驶得更轻松从容了，你也一样吗？<br>[Jackie]: Yes absolutely<br>杰克：是的，当然<br>[Mr. Keshe]: What we see, pardon?<br>凯：我们就看到，重复一下？<br>[Danny]: I said I will report the same thing as, yes it does drive differently.<br>丹尼：我说，我也一样，是的，驾驶起来很不同<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It looks like you’re, you are moving on air tight cushion is not so attached to earth, am I correct?<br>凯：这就好像，你是在空气垫上面移动，而与地球的抓地力减轻了，与地球不那么紧密了，是这样吗？<br>[Jackie]: You are totally correct.<br>杰克：很正确<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay<br>凯：好<br>[Danny]: Also my wife’s car seemed to have a problem with the CV joint in the back there, the UV joint in the back and it does not seem to have it<br>丹尼：我的妻子的汽车似乎看起来有一点问题，就是无极变速轴接合处还有后面UV结合处似乎看起来….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay let’s just explain to you what happens first of all most of your system get nano coated so what in fact you have created now because its 2 3 of you now we can release the information, it’s been sitting with us for a while is that you create a Magrav structure, your Magrav structure reacts against earth magnetic gravitational field inertia not gravitational field and in that respect because your car is made of the matter state and you have nano coated it, now you find the car does not actually fly but it becomes positioned slightly different on the platform in contact with earth so in way let’s say if this is the earth and you have a wheel which will be like this in a normal car you will be more like this if you understand the difference the point of friction changes. The car is not hovering make it very clear the car due to gravitational magnetic field which you have created to you, you connect one of the connections to earth you connect one of the connects of the battery to earth to the body so what in fact what you are doing you have already nano coated the whole the same as you done in the house and this condition creates its own gravitational magnetic field and because its made of the element of the earth which is plastics or the metals or whatever it finds it gravatational  field position in respect to the inertia of the planet.<br>凯：好，让我告诉你发生的是什么 ，首先，你的大部分系统被纳米涂层化了，所以你实际上所创造的，因为现在至少有2到3人已经释放了这些相关的知识，有一段时间了，你创造了一个磁引力场结构 （蓝色涂笔），你的汽车的磁引力场对地球的磁引力场的惯性产生排斥 （箭头），而不是与地球的引力场，由于你的车是由物质态成分组成，你对它进行了纳米涂层，你会发现尽管你的车不能飞起来，但它在与地球的互动中的位置变得稍微不同 ，如果说这是地球 （横线），你有一个正常汽车的车轮子 （圆圈），而你的经过纳米化的汽车变得更像这样 （右边大的轮子），摩擦点改变了，很清楚汽车不是在悬浮，汽车是由于你所创造的磁引力场的作用，你将一条线接到接地端口，一条线连接到电池，连接到汽车的整体，事实上你做的就是对汽车整体进行纳米涂层 ，就像你对自己房子所做的一样，这种条件下就创造了自己的磁引力场环境 ，由于汽车是由地球上的元素如塑料或者金属做成的，它会发现自己的引力场与地球的惯性相互定位 。</p>
<p>So you will drive a slight bit, the more you drive the more you thicken your nano coating the easier drive it becomes. We assume that in the long run you will be just shifting of the ground but not enough to be totally detached. You are not there. That’s why your steering feels easier, because there is no pressure because when you on the ground and you have the steering to turn it feels you know  you have to turn it. Yeah so we were going to announce this before when we going to launch the Magrav system for the cars but we left till people report it. We know about this a long time ago. So we can disclose the knowledge.<br>凯：所以你驾驶越多你的纳米涂层就越厚，驾驶起来变得更轻松。我们预计从长期看你会与地面产生漂移 （最右边圆圈），但还不足以完全脱离地面，这就是为什么你操控起来更轻松，因为没有压力，因为在地面上时，你有方向盘去操纵，它给你的感觉是你知道不得不去转动它。是的。在发布车用磁引力场装置之前我们没有说这些，而是我们留给人们来反馈与报告。我们很早之前就知道这些。所以我们能够释放这些知识。When you use you find a lot of problem, problems with the steering wheel and thing just disappears because everything is nano coated and the performance of the friction disappears. Nano coat your material, your engine will nano coat your piston will nano coat your wheels bearing everything nano coat because you connect one line to the earth to body of the car so it has to go through the body it has no choice and you nano coat it the rest becomes impossible more or less and we have reports from the people who have on the car the scratches more or less disappear. In a way it doesn’t disappear the coating allow the deformation of paint underneath and they come together it will not sort your bump on the car if you have a dent on it but anything to do with the paint work for the steel it repair itself, nano coating will come and then creates a gravitational magnetic field which allows the metal to seal because now you have a nano coating surface.<br>凯：当你使用，你会发现很多的问题，如操控方面的问题都消失了，因为所有东西都被纳米涂层了，摩擦体现出的问题也消失了。你对你的材料进行纳米涂层，你的引擎被纳米涂层，你的活塞被纳米涂层，你的车轮与轴承，所有的东西都被纳米涂层。因为你将一条线连接到汽车的接地端，所以纳米经过整个车身，没有选择，你进行纳米涂层，车绣变得或多或少不可能，我们也听到报告说车身的刮痕也消失了。某种程度上说，也并不是消失，纳米涂层会覆盖住变形的车漆，它们融合在一起。但如果你的车身严重变形，纳米涂层就不能帮你这个忙，让它复原。但车漆或者方向盘操控上的问题它都能自动修复，因为纳米涂层在进行，它创造一个磁引力场允许你的金属密封，因为你有一个纳米涂层表面了。<br>If you have a black car all your scratches disappear. So for the first time we disclose this because now when you speak to it that is why we walk you into it for your confirmation because we already know the information, so now it’s time to disclose. Those of you who use Magrav system for the car especially those we supplied to the Keshe foundation from the source you will see the reduction but you will totally different performance in the car too. The ones you make yourself have to make sure follows the same kind of procedure as is on the blueprint. The reduction in the fuel is so much what we assumed is due to the lack of friction because you create gravitational magnetic field position on the what I call inertia level and your point of friction is less, you use less fuel. It’s a double sided work.<br>凯：如果你有一辆黑色的车，你的所有的刮痕都会消失。所以第一次我们公开这些知识。因为现在你们讲到了，所以基于你们的报告我们就把你们带进这些知识里，因为我们已经知道这些知识了。所以是时候公开了。你们那些为你们自己汽车使用磁引力场装置的人，尤其是那些从凯史基金会购买车用能量装置的人，你们会看到能量消耗的减少，而且你会在你的汽车里看到明显不同的性能。那些自己制作单元的人请确保按照蓝图的步骤行事。能耗减少是很明显的，我们估计是由于摩擦的减少，因为你在惯性层面创造了一个磁引力场位置 ，你的摩擦点位减少了，你就会使用更少的燃料。这是一个双面的效果。<br> Here you carry let’s say 200kg here you carry 150kg here you carry let’s say 100kg in fact you the same weight but because the point of friction with earth is less you get the reduction in the room. This is the first gravitational magnetic hovering system which now we will stopby  the Belgian government to show in Hanover. You will slowly you lot will report it you will report getting there when these systems run for a few months you will start reporting this to us and you are the first ones coming out. The first what we call flying machine today has been unveiled but we know that a long time ago. So if you carry on using it that the nano coating becomes totally around the car. In fact you still carry 200 kilos in fact everything looks the same but because of Magrav position on the nano coating your car point of contact with the ground will become less and because it is less you use less fuel. Partially. Yes exactly of course.<br>凯：这里你是200KG ，这里是150KG，这里是100KG ，事实上你是一样的重量，但由于与地面之间摩擦点位的减少，你就会在一种相对的比较中得到减少。这是第一个磁引力场悬浮系统，由于比利时政府的阻止，我们停止了在德国汉诺威的展示。你们会慢慢的看到效果，并会报告出来，在这些系统运行几个月之后。你们会开始报告给我们。你是第一个出来报告的。这个飞行机器今天公布于众，但是我们很早就知道了。所以如果一直持续进行纳米涂层，汽车就会完全被纳米化，事实上你还是200KG，所有事情都还是一样，但因为纳米涂层上的磁引力场点位 的作用，你的汽车与地面的接触点变少了，因为减少了，你就会使用更少的燃料。部分的。是的，当然。<br>[Danny]: Is it still advisable to possibly hook it to your starter motor I was going to do one these.<br>丹尼：是否可以把它连上你的启动电机，我准备这样做<br>[Mr. Keshe]: As long as the battery is connected as I said we disclosed when it comes I discussed this with Alex in July August when you was with us. We are aware of this for a long time but we did not make any claims now that we push start we explain exactly scientifically what happens. When you use this especially for a long time that’s why I want you to hand over your car to Peugeot and hopefully we work through Peugeot France to the new agreement to Peugeot Iran as we are is that we will bring in this arm into open, we brought in it and now we explain it. I was waiting for this for a few weeks. Somebody put this and we can enlighten you.<br>凯：只要你的电池被连接上，正如我说的，当它来临时，我们就释放知识，我与阿历克斯在6月和8月谈到过，你们也在场。（02:51:25) 我们很早就知道了，但是我们没有作任何声明，现在你们提出了，我们就来进行科学的解释。当你使用很长时间，这就是为什么我们想要你把汽车交给标致，希望通过我们努力使得法国标致与伊朗标致达成协议，我们会公开这些事情，我们带来的，我们就会解释。我等这个有几个星期了。一旦有人提出，我们就可以给你们启发的知识。<br>So you see the first hovering car  you are reaching that point the more you use it, it comes to a point. We done the research with not research we did some work with Kent University the professor was supposed to be the head of the car division of the Keshe foundation taking over the Entrap plant. We discussed minmum weight is to 100kg that you are safe that the cross wind does not take a hold of. When we saw this. This was part of the structure we were going to show in Hanover when the thing of Belgium ordered everything to be confiscated to embarrass the foundation. Now we putting the shame on the Kingdom. Now you see it, it took 5 years later but it is on the table that’s what you feel is your studying it’s just that the more you drive your car the more you nano coat.<br>凯：所以你们看见这第一个悬浮汽车，你们到达这一点：你们使用的越多，它就会达到这个状态。我们与肯特大学合作，那里一个教授会成为凯史基金会汽车分部的负责人，接管安特普的部门。我们讨论过最低重量要100KG，这样你才安全，才能在风中稳定车身。这是结构的一部分，我们本准备在汉诺威展示，但比利时国王动用一切手段使基金会陷于困窘，现在我们为这个王国感到耻辱。现在你们看到了，花了5年时间终于公诸于众，你在学习，没有什么改变，你越驾驶你的汽车，你就越能对它进行纳米涂层。<br>The nano coat is not gravitational because it’s the mass of the body is inertia. Your system are not made to fly you but because the nano coating is such a huge mass of it, you nano coating now has to show a reaction in respect to the earth inertia and that’s why it keeps a distance that why you say we  had nothing in the back of the car it doesn’t come. You nano coat everything now everything is new. New surface, new colours you see everything else. The car unit delivered by Keshe foundation will deliver the fuel reduction but on these basis composite energy replacing part of the fuel and composite in another way by in way reducing the weight. Welcome to the world of the space technology all of you we are now becoming astronaut in your own cars, you will all become what we call the motions man made gravitational system.<br>凯：纳米涂层不是引力，因为身体的重量形成惯性。你的系统不是用来飞行，但是因为纳米涂层你的这么大质量的汽车，汽车就会与地球的惯性场产生互动反应，就会保持一定距离，这就是为什么你说我们在汽车的后面什么也没有。你对所有的东西都进行纳米涂层，一切成为新的。新的表面，新的颜色，以及你看见其他一切。凯史基金会发给你的汽车单元会实现能耗的减少，在这基础上，复合性的能量会部分取代燃料，而且这种复合性能够减少重量。欢迎来到太空科技的世界，你们所有人，你们变成你们汽车内的宇航员，你们将会变成人造的引力系统的运动部分。<br>Your cars when you are inside it is the same as you are inside the spaceship because now you are part of the structure of it. A lot of you will see the more you use your car a lot of pains and aches in your body just disappears. You find sitting in your car and you had the problem and the problem is not there as Jackie said you put the right combination in cigarette lighter it becomes part of it. You become like the Japanese scientist. The Japanese scientist happy people. What happens is that you become part of the atmosphere of the system while you drive. It’s not that the body of the car nano coated now you are in a tube of field which if you made your gans of the thing of your CO2 you live and exist in the structure of your car as usual. A lot of diseases will disappear while you are in the car. You will go in with the pain you will come out without the pain. But this takes times.<br>凯：你的汽车，当你在你的汽车里面时，就如同你在太空中一样。因为你成为了结构的一部分。你们很多人会发现你越是使用你的汽车你身上的一些疼痛就会消失。你发现你坐在汽车里，如果你有问题，你的问题就会消失。正如杰克所说，你把正确的组合放在点烟器，它就成为其中一部分。你变得像日本科学家，中国科学家 。所发生的是当你驾驶的时候你变成系统大气场的一部分 。这个不只是你的汽车被纳米涂层，现在你在一种状如试管的磁场中，如果你加了CO2甘斯，你像以前一样坐在汽车里 ，你的大部分疾病都会消失。你带着疼痛进入汽车，出来时，疼痛就已经消失了。但这需要时间。<br>The cars will have started reaching cannot the last bits which is not allowing me to take over is because the gravitational field with hold but because of the composite structure of the planet earth it has the gravitational and magnetical plus inertia. Inertia is the attribute gravitational magnetic field of the state of the solid matter that why earth is a composite plasma. Composite gravitational scene. It has gravitational magnetical and it has inertia. Now your car interacts with the inertiaof it the reason which will not fly the gravitational field of the earth still has a say and that’s 150 to 200kilo out of the 100 kilo which you receive.<br>凯：汽车开始达到一种不是让你完全掌控的状态，因为引力场的牵制作用，但因为地球的复合结构，它就有引力，磁力以及惯性 。惯性是固态物质的磁引力场体现的属性，这就是为什么地球上是复合的等离子体，复合的引力场的地域。它有引力与磁力，还有惯性。现在你得汽车与地球的惯性发生互动 （双箭头），不能飞行的原因是地球的引力场仍在发挥着作用 （左边长线），这就是实际上是150KG到200KG，而你收到的是100KG。<br>What will be interesting when you are in Peugeot please ask them to weigh your car, when we will organise that I speak to our people that when you get to Peugeot they know exactly how to test things we want to test and then we ask Peugeot to play with is publicly bring the chief scientists  of researchof  the Peugeot car to be on it and if they don’t want to do we do it with Volkswagen or we send your car to Tehran to office of his excellency president of Iran to ask the Peugeot of Iran to test for you. We have a lot connections and we have a lot of good friends. Now you come everything is public.<br>凯：有趣的是，当你在标致，请他们称一称你的汽车，我们会安排，当你去标致，我会告诉我们的人，他们知道怎么测试这些我们想要测试的事情，我们会要求标致公布于众，让标致研发中心的首席科学家宣布这些事情，如果他们不想做，我们就和大众一起做。或者我们会把你的汽车寄到伊朗总统的办公室，要求伊朗标致公司为你的车进行测试。我们有很多关系，以及很多朋友。现在你来了，所有事情是公开的。<br>[Jackie]: Okay perfect, thank you very much.<br>杰克：好的，很好。谢谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Maybe you get a new car we got to speak to Peugeot to see if they can give you one.<br>凯：可能你得到一个新车，我们会跟标致说，看是否他们能给你一辆新车。<br>[Jackie]: You know it, it’s difficult to give this car, it’s my gift.<br>杰克：你知道，交出这辆车对我来说比较难，因为它是我的礼物。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; No problem we see what we can do, you will get it back I will make sure Peugeot gives it back to you, we will see what we can do as part of the research,<br>凯：没问题，我们会做我们能够做的，你会取回你的车，我会让标致将它还给你，我们会尽力这样做，这是研究的一部分<br>[Jackie]: Yes absolutely<br>杰克：是的，当然<br>[Keshe]: Thank you very much, thank you for sharing knowledge and your time with us. The process is vet very effective.<br>凯：很感谢。谢谢你的分享以及你的时间与我们在一起，这个进程十分有效。<br>[Person]: On that as well the we have a lot of healths in…<br>某人：我们有很多关于健康方面的….<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Pardon, Hello?<br>凯：重复一些，是谁？<br>[Rick]; I think it was just an interfering microphone there.<br>瑞克：我认为是那边耳机上的干扰。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay no problem so today we learn we learn something more and we get enlighten in different way, so what you seen the car unit have this ability but don’t get we always say understand the science not just because it does. The prize we are…yes?<br>凯：好的。没问题，今天我们学到了一些知识，我们通过不同的方式启迪人们，所以你们看见你的汽车单元所体现出的性能，但是我们总是说要理解其中的科学原理，不只是它的效果。这样的好处是….什么？<br>[Robert]: I wanted to add to the knowledge and helps a lot in the snow too we have a lot of snow too. And rather than getting stuck I have a 2 wheel drive truck and it hasn’t gone stuck once this year and when we do have problems we trying to intend when there is a lot of snow we try to do know. We want do more  It seems to help.<br>罗伯特：我想要增加一些知识，它在大雪中很大的帮助了我们，我们这里有很大的雪。比起其他汽车陷入雪中，我们的车的轮子仍然可以驱动车开起来，不会被厚雪困住，今年我们有很多问题，我们试着，有很大的雪，我们想试试，做更多的测试，看起来有效果。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you enlighten us we don’t know what you are talking about.<br>凯：你能说清楚你所讲的吗？<br>[Robert]: well a lot of times in the deeps snow cars, vehicles will get stuck and its seems if we intend to continue on a straight forward line then that’s what happens we don’t get stuck in the snow any longer.<br>罗：这样的，大部分时间在下雪，在成很深的积雪，汽车等被卡住，我们想要继续在一条直线上行驶，我们不再被积雪卡住，这就是所发生的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Why because you are using the Magrav systems?<br>凯：为什么？是因为你在使用磁引力场系统吗？<br>[Robert]: Yes that what it seems like.<br>罗：是的，看起来是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Where are you and who are you?<br>凯：你在哪里，你是谁？<br>[Robert]: Robert Subblefield in Utah<br>罗伯特：来自犹他州的罗伯特<br>[Mr. Keshe]: so you have Magrav system in there.<br>凯：哦，你有一个磁引力场系统<br>[Robert]: We have Magrav system in both of our vehicles and it seems to really helps it does.<br>罗：我们汽车上都有磁引力场装置，它看起来起到效果<br>[Mr. Keshe]: have you seen any reduction in your field?<br>凯：你看见有什么节省吗？<br>[Robert]: earlier I saw about 15% which is just what we can, what I can prove because in the wintertime we start our vehicles and let them run for a few minutes before we drive them and that’s not taken into account so it could very well be 25% who knows. Previously, I am going to you the numbers previously we were getting 320-360 miles per tank on my wife’s vehicle and now were getting up right around 400 even with all the factors counted in.<br>罗：早先，我看见有15% 的节省，这是我能够证明的；在冬天，在驾驶之前，我们会让车开动运行几分钟，这些没有被计算考虑在内，肯定有25%的节省，谁知道。以前，我的妻子的汽车一箱油跑到320到360英里，现在达到400英里，这还是加入所有因素的情况下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: That’s nice but you feel the difference in drive?<br>凯：很好，你也感觉到汽车驾驶起来有所不同？<br>[Robert]; that’s the biggest thing yes. That’s the it seems to be, it seems to affect your focus while driving it is almost like it is an interactive system. I can’t wait to put some gans water in the tank as well I think that would be a great reaction interacting that the two ganses together and then we would be the third interaction in that equation and so I can’t wait to do that, thanks Jackie for bringing that up.<br>罗：是的，这是更值得说的事情。它看起来似乎，似乎在开车时影响你的注意力，它几乎是一个互动的系统，我同样迫不及待把甘斯水放进油箱里，那将会是很好的一种反应与互动，两种甘斯在一起，在磁引力场层面上就会形成第三个互动源，我迫不及待想要那样做，谢谢你，杰克，分享这个<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thank you indeed. Yes this is the hovering condition and with we know about it and now you understand scientifically what it does and we know that because I remember Alex sitting next to me, talking to me the first time he came, if you remember in what you  in call in Tranny and he was telling me “It really does it’s such an old car but it feels like new it doesn’t clink clank and he just tried to say” and I explain to him this is what’s happening and now that a number of you are reporting especially with the know. So we can disclose now you understand what has happened is  the reduction because is because of the nano coating of your machine of the car, nothing else. The inside the car it will be interesting if those of you who have used the system to report back to us if you had pains and other things and you see going and if it’s been reduced. And these all count and if come into the car and you are tired from work and by the time you get home you are all fresh means you are taking from the energy from the environment of your car. These are the things which we need to add as testimonials and then it gives us a direction to go.<br>凯：很感谢。是的，这是一个悬浮的环境，我们已经知道，现在你们也能科学性的了解了它的原理。我们知道，因为我记得阿历克斯坐在我的旁边，第一次对我讲述这些事情，他告诉我说：“真的很管用，它只是一辆很旧的车，但现在看起来像新的，它不在疙瘩疙瘩的响了，他在只是想要描述”，我给他解释所发生的事情，现在你们很多人会开始报告这些事情，所以我们释放这些知识，你们就能明白发生了什么，能源的节省是因为你的汽车被纳米涂层，没有其他原因。汽车里面的环境会变得很有趣，你们有人可能会给我们报告说你们身上的疼痛消失了，或者至少缓解了。你回到家，感觉就像新生一样，这意味着你从汽车的环境中获取了能量。这些是我们需要在测试网页上添加的，这给我们指引了一个方向。<br>[Vivic]: Mr. Keshe this is Vivic from Singapore, related question we receive a lot of these question in tech support what is correct connection for a fully electric car.<br>维微克：凯史先生，我是来自新加坡的维微克，我们收到很多关于技术支持的问题，比如一个全电动汽车的连接方式是怎么样的？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: A lot of electric cars have invertors on it, this is something which are even looked at you have a AC/DC invertor and you plasma system is already DC you see this now working. You have to connect it beyond the invertor. Do you understand?<br>凯：很多电动汽车上都有逆变器，这是我们看见的，你有AC/DC逆变器，而你的等离子体是DC（直流），你看见这样的运行。你必须越过逆变器进行连接，你明白吗？<br>[Vivic]: The invertor is where the motor is isn’t it?<br>维微克：逆变器就是在马达的位置，是吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Pardon?<br>凯：重复一遍？<br>[Vivic]; the invertor is actually where the motor is isn’t it that drives that drives the wheels?<br>微：逆变器事实上是在马达的位置，是吗？用来驱动<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes it has to put it, I don’t know because different systems, I tell you this because it was explained to me by a car electrician because we have those of you who are in training and we have 6, 7 cars sitting outside and we try to use it and we use it and don’t see anything and said this is your problem so one these cars soon is going to the garage to be connected with the invertor out Then we can tell you what as far as I know what I have been explained to for the people who understand the car electrical work. It’s the invertor which blocks you have to connect beyond  invertor so I am sure if Reny was here he would explain to us. If Reny had a car maybe he can explain to us a little bit nice.<br>凯：必须放上去，我不知道，因为汽车系统不一样，我告诉你这个，是因为一个汽车电气工程师这样告诉我的，因为你们一些想要这样测试，我们有6到7辆车在外面，我们试着使用它，没有看见任何事情，这是你的问题；这些车中的一辆将会被送去汽车修理站，被连接上逆变器，我告诉你目前我所知道的，是一些知道汽车电气工作原理的人告诉我这方面的知识，是逆变器在阻碍你，你得越过（beyond invertor)你的逆变器进行连接，我很肯定，如果瑞尼在，他能解释给我们听，如果瑞尼有一辆车，他会更好的解释给我们听。<br>[Robert]; so are we connecting it to the DC side or the AC of the invertor, for the invertor?<br>罗：所以我们连接到直流一遍还是逆变器的交流一边？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: DC side because the plasma is DC.<br>凯：直流一边，因为等离子体是直流的<br>[Robert]: okay great, thank you very much. Yeah I am putting one in the electric vehicle very soon and that will be great thank you.<br>罗：好的，十分感谢。很快我将会把它安装在我的电动交通工具里，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you video it for us and explain it us that we can show it this question has come up quite a few times and I am not mechanic in that direction so I rely on the people who understand and they rely to us.<br>凯：你可以上传视屏，为我们解释，这样我们可以展示，这个问题被提出来了很多次了，我在那方面不是专家，所以我需要有理解的人来为我们作解释，启发我们<br>[Robert]: yes of course I will do that and yeah, anything you need.<br>罗：是的，当然，我会那样做的，只要是你需要的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much, anybody else?<br>凯：很感谢。还有人有问题吗？<br>[Person]: Hello? Just want to give a really quick testimonial about my …my name is Malvin from Germany on camera. Hello<br>马瑞：在？我想要分享一个测试 是关于我的……我的名字是马瑞，来自德国，在摄像上。在吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes<br>凯：在<br>[Malvin]: Yesterday I burnt myself with a wire heating wires and then I sued one of the pens and I tried to pick up the wire while it was still hot, it thought it was cool already but it was still hot and I burnt my big finger and my thumb and then I used pain pen and the first I used it on the in index finger I held about 1 or 2 cm away and it only took like 10, 15 seconds and then after like 2 minutes I pointed it to the thumb and again about 15 seconds and the pain was gone. I am actually pretty happy that I burnt myself.<br>马瑞：昨天我们烧伤了自己，用一个很热的线，我使用了笔，我是试着去拾起那根线，然而它还是很热的。我以为已经很凉了，但还是很热，我烧伤了我的大拇指和食指，然后我使用止痛笔，我是第一次使用，将它用在食指上，离食指1到2CM远，大概10到15秒，然后2分钟后，我又指向拇指，大概15秒，疼痛就消失了。我现在还很高兴我烧伤了自己。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I tell you one thing what you just said if you go back to recordings I have said this before, the new pen which is gone on sale on Tuesday on Keshe foundation. When I saw it the first time was put in front of me by our directors I said to even to Caroline and Almen and the others we want to get sick just to try it, it’s so good now you explain the same thing, you glad you did it and these pens can be used for burns 1th degree, 2nd degree burns we will teach you in the coming days what to do. You put the CO2 pads on the wound which is covered as usual you don’t put CO2 directly on the skin that could be mix it in the tissue and then plastic and you just hold the pen of top of. And you find out not only the pain but the regeneration of the skin will become very rapid if you have the coils the flat coils if you have created the double coils you can put a double coil one side of the hand and a double coil on the other side with the CO2 skin in between. The CO2 in the plastic cover on the skin where is the burn leave it for like 2,3, hours leave it for the growth of the skin tissue very rapidly.<br>凯：我告诉你一件事，关于你刚才说的，如果你回到以前我们所说的，新的医疗笔已经在星期二开始出售，在基金会网站上。当我看见负责人送来这个新的笔，放在在我面前，我甚至对卡洛琳和阿曼以及其他人说我们或许想要病一场来感受一下，这很好，现在你说了同样的事情，你很高兴你做过，这些笔可以应用在1级，2级烧伤上面，我以后会教你如何去做。你把CO2包放在伤口处，就像往常一样覆盖住伤口，你不是把CO2甘斯直接放在皮肤上，而是混合在面纸里然后用塑料密封，然后将笔置于伤口上方。你会发现不仅是疼痛，还有皮肤的再生都会变得很快。如果你有平的线圈，而且是双线圈，你可以把一个双线圈放在手的一边，另一双线圈放在另一边，CO2甘斯袋置于中间，持续2到3小时，你会看见你的皮肤组织的生长会变得很快。<br>[Malvin]: Do you have to have to have it connected to some sort of power source?<br>马瑞：那么，需要将它连接到某个能量源吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: plasma batteries, you can connect your feedback of the load for the energy transfer literally to the plastic which is carrying the gans you feed it back to itself but into the gans. So what I…<br>凯：等离子体电池，你能把你的用于转移能量的负载反馈端连上携带甘斯塑料（CO2包），你能实现回馈，但能量能够进入甘斯，所以<br>[Malvin]: Yeah you have explained this before in another teaching<br>马瑞：是的，你在以前一次教学里讲过<br>[Mr. Keshe]; so we have to just do it I am going to minimise what, I can you see you me writing?<br>凯：所以现在我们做一下，我要最小化，你能看见我在写吗？<br>[Malvin]: Nope I am just going to stop my video.<br>马瑞：没有，我来关闭我的视屏<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Vince can you, if I<br>凯：文斯，你能<br>[Rick]: no we can’t see your screen there Mr. Keshe<br>瑞克：我门看不见你的视屏，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay there let me see, how do I share you? Yeah wait okay I got it. I am learning slowly I am a very slow coach for learning somewhere. If this is your arm is this is your skin burnt, you put a double coil here the skin burned let’s say is on this side, you put the CO2 patch here and then you put a second coil here. You connect the way we show with the springs to here. You connect this one to a plasma battery, a PB and then you connect this one back to the plastic as a feedback or you can connect this one back to the other side of the skin. The field flow will grow the skin very rapidly understand the reason why first of all you create a new layer, these 2 and this one will create the 3rd layer to be considered to be there so the rest of the skins builds up to it, the flesh builds up to it.<br>凯：好的，让我看看，我怎么分享出来？好，我懂了。我在学习，我是一个迟钝的人但我在学习。如果这是你的手臂 ，这是你烧伤的皮肤 （下面的线），如果你把你的双线圈放在这里 ，你的烧伤的皮肤在这一边 （上面），把CO2包放在这里 （上面长方形），然后你在这里再放一个双线圈 ，将它们连接起来 ，再连接到一个等离子体电池（ＰＢ） ，然后你将这个线圈与CO 2包连接在一起 作为一个反馈，或者你将线圈连接到这边的皮肤 ，场流会使皮肤生长的很快，理解原因，你们创造了新的一层，线圈与CO2包之间在皮肤上创造第三层结构 （蓝色线），所以剩下的皮肤组织起来，新的皮肤组织生长起来。<br> You need 3 gravitational magnetic field to create a surface, this is what we are doing in the space technology to create a craft. Here the first one is here, the second one is here and the 3rd one is here so because the skin is in-between somewhere here because there is an interface you see the field flow will more or less instantaneously the pain disappears because what it does this here the pain is flow of the gravitational magnetic field plasma which is not absorbed for the tissues which are there to be fed. That is why we feel pain, the reason we feel pain in our body it’s not that there is a burn it’s because the continuous flow whatever comes cannot go so the energy of the information back and forth so its release in the position of the loss and we feel it as a pain it’s the energy released from the flow from the information from our brain and the rest of it.<br>凯：你需要三个磁引力场创造一个表面 ，这就是我们在太空技术中所做的创建一个飞船的过程 ，现在第一层在这里，第二层在这里，第三层在这里 （两个线圈与一个CO2包形成三层结构），皮肤就在它们之间形成一个场的交流界面，疼痛差不多会消失，因为疼痛是等离子体磁引力场的流动 （蓝色小圈），这些等离子体场流无法被那里的皮肤层所吸收，这就是我们为什么感受到疼痛，我们在身体上感受到疼痛的原因不是在于伤口本身 ，因为无论哪里来的持续的场流无法畅通运行 （被上面半圆所阻碍），携带信息的能量流只能上下前后来回运动，在这些缺失的位置点释放自己 ，我们感觉就像疼痛，这个信息能量形成的场流来自于大脑以及其余部分<br>[Malvin]: Here and the blisters go away?<br>马瑞：水泡也会消失吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes within a day or 2 it just disappears if you do it properly we are going to release this Benjamin in Ghana has produced a number of these things in his photograph did we show it to you? So what happens is that the pain here the energy the plasmatic energy of the information now sits in the floor or the plasma so in a way its gets diluted into, so you don’t feel any pain. The reason you don’t feel the pain because you carry with you the energy flow. You carry the what’s in there, this is what we said when you grow a nail or a finger or whatever you do the same process but this time you do through it and then what happens here because the energy has chance to go to normal the growth becomes normal and you get the rapid growth of the fresh<br>凯：是的，在1天或者2天内就会消失，如果你做的正确的话，我们将会释放这些，在加纳的本杰明制作了大量的这些东西，在图片上可以看到，我们可以展示给你看。发生的是，这个疼痛，这个携带信息的等离子体能量 （圆圈）处于三层磁引力场形成的等离子体场流中 ，在某种程度上被稀释了，所以你就感觉不到疼痛。你感觉不到疼痛的原因是现在你携带着能量流，当你长出指甲或者手指或无论什么是一样的过程，但这一次你是通过这样的方式，因为在这里的能量有一个回到正常的机会 （中间蓝色），开始正常生长，新生组织开始快速出现<br>What you take us say 3 months you can do it in 3 to 5 days if it’s done correctly so in a way when you have first degree burn or second degree I was talking about it before this is how it happens. You don’t feels the pain the information carried becomes normal because pain is the energy, plasmatic energy which arrives at the point of delivery that it has nowhere to deliver it releases itself it like you get and electric shock. Pain is like electric shock you get…but that is because you get so many millions of cells have to be delivered energy to it becomes a very continuous.<br>凯：如果你做的正确，你能在3到5天实现，而不是3个月。当你有1级或者2级烧伤，就像我之前说的，原理就是这样的。你感觉不到疼痛，所携带的信息变得正常，因为疼痛是等离子体能量，当它达到一个传输的点却不能实现传输时，它就会释放自己，就像你被电击一样。疼痛就像电击。但因为你有上百万的细胞需要传输能量，就变得持续了。</p>
<p>The minute you give the patch you give the plasmatic energy a channel to flow that is why you don’t feel the pain but if you keep even the CO2 patch on you create a field now the flesh grows very rapidly because it grows as an rapid pace, what will be interesting to see if this technology the way you see with the 2 on the centre will help with the growth of organs if you can speed up like amputated finger to grow in less than 3 months instead of 3 years but this is where the research stuff should be done. This is why you don’t feel the pain you transfer and because its not there no more transfer of information comes to operation as far as the cell is it’s just building up and then the skin appears very rapidly. We seen this very you do the same thing with the bone. If you have a broken bone you do the same I tell you it works magic. I have seen doctors biting their nails with it, what happens when you have a broken bone like a rib or you have a crack wound or your bone or your cracked rib put a patch. Especially I know what I am talking about the one which you put with the belt, the belt with the pad which put up for sale in the Keshe foundation. Put a patch on it and you literally see the bone literally recovers so fast. It puzzles the doctors when it happened to me.<br>凯：当你放上CO2包的一刻，你就给予了让等离子体能量流动的管道，这就是你为何感觉不到疼痛，但如果你一直把CO2放在上面，你就会创造一个场，新生组织生长的就更快，它以更快的节奏在生长，有趣的是这项技术，正如我们看见的在中间放上2个，将会帮助器官的生长，如果你能使其快速生长，就像被截肢的手指的生长一样，只需3月而不是3年，但这是相关的研究人员应该做的。这就是你为何感觉不到疼痛，你在转移，因为那里没有更多需要转移的信息来阻碍细胞的建立与重组，皮肤就开始快速恢复。我们对骨头所做的也是一样的。如果你有破裂的骨头，你也可以做一样的事情。我来告诉你，效果很神奇。我看见许多医生看见后都会咬自己的指甲。发生的是，你有一个坏的骨头，肋骨或裂开的骨头 ，裂开的肋骨，放上CO2包 ，尤其我知道你们用的止痛带，止痛带和止痛包在基金会都在出售中，放上包，你会看见骨头实际上恢复的很快 。这是发生在我身上的事，这给那些医生造成困惑。<br>[Malvin]: The pain pad alone?<br>马瑞：只用止痛包？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The pain pad alone yeah. At that time the paid pad alone but I used the tanks for the water to energize the situation as well. I had 10 broken ribs, I broke a rib on a Thursday afternoon in the mountains north of, east of Belgium the rescue team brought me down with internal bleeding and everything they carried me on a Monday they kept me on sedation in a coma condition because it was too much damage I started the process of using the pad and the cup on a Monday afternoon. Caroline brought to hospital for me, the following Monday the doctors because they were taking x-ray for me every day they could see just disappearing more or less and the following Monday the doctor told me Mehran everything is healed you can go home by Wednesday is everything is okay. And really I can tell you 2 weeks from the fall temporal internal injuries I healed everything and I gave lecturer at his house.<br>凯：是的，只用包。只用包，但我用了水槽给那个环境提供能量，我有10个破裂的肋骨，是一个星期四的下午我在比利时东部山区发生的，救援队把我带下来，有内出血，在星期一他们使用镇静剂使我处于昏迷状态，因为受伤很严重，我在星期一下午进行医疗包和水的治疗。卡洛琳为我带到医院来的，第二个星期一，医生一直在为我做Ｘ射线检查，他们能看见差不多消失了，接下来星期一医生告诉我所有都愈合了，星期三你能回家了，如果明天没有问题。两个星期我就将颞内损伤治愈好了，并且在他的房间做了一次演讲<br>[Malvin]: Can you tell me, I have really several kind of  pains, I once had a pain in my shoulder and I put a pain pad on and it was gone and a while later maybe half an hour later but when I have headaches it usually doesn’t work.<br>马瑞：你能告诉我，我确实有不同类的疼痛，我以前背部有疼痛，我把减痛包放在上面，疼痛就消失了，可能半个消失吧。但是对我的头痛却起不到作用。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No it’s different the pain pads work for muscle tissue nerve tissue within the muscle red meat not for the head. The pain in the head is totally different that is you can use the CO2 pad not the Magrav plasma pads<br>凯：这是不同的。这个减痛包作用于肌肉组织，以及肌肉里面的神经组织，血红组织，不是用于头部。在头部的疼痛是完全不同的，你可以使用CO2包，而不是磁引力场等离子体包。<br>[Malvin]: okay thank you.<br>马瑞：好的，谢谢。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: because the brain has not got any red tissue. If you have a head ache this is my experiment you have to test it yourself but I can, if you want a testimony we have the whole pictures of it, in more of less 7 days, 10 brains totally repaired I never felt any pain, no pain what so ever and it was just a, I suffered more from what do you call it infection of the lung with green stuff coming out of my lung that with my ribs I have no pain in my ribs and the process of repair is very rapid. What it takes months it happens in weeks in happens days after hours and the pain pads we put for sale yesterday or the day before I have used those and that’s what was it 24th of June 2010 6 years ago nearly. We are aware of the technology and the work of it for years now we bring it to public it’s not something just coming up the line so if you have a broken leg whatever this is all burn this pads work because we use it I use it myself. And the way it works it because the plasma flow and the plasmatic condition takes away, when you have a pain it’s the information carrier that it cannot be delivered so when it takes the way the body is a normal process and it just processes itself it works very well on broken bones and burns but remember why it does and the reason it does. Any other enlightenment?<br>凯：因为头部没有血红组织。如果你有头痛，这是我的经验，你得自己测试，如果你想要测试材料，我们有关于它的全部图片，差不多7天，10天就可以完全好转。我感觉不到任何疼痛，没有疼痛，我遭受痛苦的是肺部感染，有绿色的东西从我的肋骨那边的肺部出来，我的肋骨没有疼痛，治愈的过程是十分快的。需要花费几个月的，这只需要花费数星期，需要几天的，这只需要几小时。昨天或前天我们将减痛包出售，我在2010年6月24号就已经在 使用了，6年以前的事情了，我们意识到这个技术，并为此工作了数年，现在我们公诸于众，它不是按照社会需求计划组织产生的，所以如果你有坏的骨头或者其他什么，这都是损坏的，这个医疗包能够起到作用，因为我们自己在使用它，而且它能起到作用，因为等离子体流很等离子体环境能够带走，当你有一个疼痛，就是携带着信息，它不能传递出去，所以当你使用医疗包，身体使一个自然的过程，它会自我修复，在坏骨头或烧伤上产生良好的效果。但是要记住，这里面的原理。还有其他的吗？<br>[Rasheed]: No. this Maffick Rasheed and I would like to show the…<br>菲西：我是菲西，我想要展示..<br>[Mr. Keshe]: where are you from? Pardon?<br>凯：你来自哪里？重复一遍？<br>[Rasheed]: I would like to show many spaceship with 9 coils I have built and I would like to show it if it possible.<br>菲西：我想要展示我所制造的9个线圈组成的飞船结构，如果可能我想要展示一下<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Where are you from?<br>凯：你来自哪里？<br>[Rasheed]: I am located in Los Angeles I am from Bangladesh<br>菲西：我来自洛杉矶，从孟加拉国来<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much is it a video you are going to show us or it’s a system you are going to show us.<br>凯：谢谢。你是要展示一个视屏还是一个系统？<br>[Rasheed]: I can do live if …<br>菲：我能现场…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay do a live because don’t like videos because we don’t want any infringement and anything you never know you might show a pepsi cola in the background and they say they don’t like it.<br>凯：好，现场展示，因为我们不喜欢视屏展示，因为我们不想任何侵权事情发生，或者你不知道的其他事情，你可能会在背景里展示 一个百事可乐，而他们会说他们不喜欢<br>[Rasheed]: ok can I share my video?<br>菲：好，我们分享我的屏幕吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I am going to stop sharing one second please.<br>凯：等一下，我来关闭我的屏幕<br>[Rasheed]: okay that is me upside down.<br>菲：好，下面的是我<br>[Mr. Keshe]: now you are up side right.<br>凯：现在你的方向对了<br>[Rasheed]: Okay so you can see it I will point my camera toward the and this I don’t know how to show it I have to lower it so it has 6 coils and they are all 22 gauge coils and then there in the in the star formation, I don’t know if you can … oh this camera.<br>菲：好的，你能看见，我把我的 摄像头对准这边，我不知道怎么展示，我得低一点，这是6个线圈，都是22号线圈，在星型组合里，我不知道，这个摄像头<br>[Rick]; It seems sideways I think and you turned the other way.<br>瑞克：到那边去了，我认为你转向另一边了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: its upside down now right way up.<br>凯：颠倒了，正确了<br>[Rasheed]: Is it the right way up.<br>菲：方向正确了吗<br>[Mr. Keshe]; I hope we can see your nostrils we don’t see any reactors<br>凯：是的。我们有希望我们能看见你的鼻孔，我们看不见你的反应器<br>[Rasheed]: Let me see whether I can …okay…okay so this is the system…<br>菲：让我看看是否，好，这是系统<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Now we are sideways.<br>凯：斜向一边了<br>[Rasheed]: Okay is that better?<br>菲：现在好些了吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]; yes we are upside down now<br>凯：颠倒了<br>[Rasheed]: okay, is this okay? I will go back a little.<br>菲：好的，我往后去一点<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  You have to stay steady we can’t look at the images.<br>凯：你得站稳，这样我们才能看清楚画面<br>[Rasheed]; so this is a 22 gauge wire system it’s very small everything is very small, and only thing is the wiring is pretty much done but I have a few questions. One is I wanted to put the other one at the top and I don’t know what the connection of that would be, would it be series with the rest of the corner units or ,<br>菲：好。这是22号线圈系统 ，很小的，所有的都很小，线路基本上完成了，但我又几个问题。一个是我想要将另一个线圈放在顶部，但我不清楚怎么连接，是与其他角落的单元串联在一起吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]; I don’t understand what you are asking that question.<br>凯：我不知道你说的什么？<br>[Rasheed]: So there are 3 elements in the base and the one that goes on the top right, something like this there is another one and it goes at the top, so how would that be connected in series with the rest of the 3 or some other way.<br>菲：在底座有3个单元，还有一个单元需要在顶部，就像这样的一个线圈，就是另外一个需要放在顶部，怎么连接，与其他3个单元形成串联<br>[Mr, Keshe]; you have to feed it in from the your magnetical to the gravitational of your base 3. A lot of people make this mistake they don’t do it. You have to feed  from your magnetical of the top coil to the gravitation of the 3 base.<br>凯：你得供给它，从你的磁力到你的3个基底的引力，许多人犯了错误不这样做，你要进行供给从你的上面线圈的磁力到你的底座的3个线圈的引力<br>[Rasheed]: Okay I see<br>菲：好，明白<br>[Mr. Keshe]: and then there is a magnetical of your 3 bases you feed into the gravitational of your 6 core stacker. So the field floor was …you can leave it out but in a way I the long run you will see more benefits for it. 凯：然后将你供给的底座的3个线圈的磁力连接到这6个能量层的引力中 ，这个磁场流是…你可以忽略，但是长远看会有很多好处。<br>[Rasheed]: I put the one on the top.<br>菲：我把它放在顶部<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The top one but comes out of it what you call you magnetical.<br>凯：这顶部的，从你的磁力中出来<br>[Rasheed]: I am talking about like adding one here<br>菲：我说的是加一个放在这上面<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The top one you have to if you want to connect it yeah. The magnetical of the last one can be joined to the gravitation of the 3 base.<br>凯：你得把上面的，如果你想要连接，恩， ，那么，最后一个线圈的磁力与三个底座的引力连接在一起<br>[Rasheed]: okay I see.<br>菲：好，明白<br>[Mr. Keshe]: you understand?<br>凯：明白吗？<br>[Rasheed]: The 3 coils that double size not the normal size of 81 being the middle one and 140, but there are like 140 in the middle and 200 and something on the, the double size does it affect anything and that’s why I…<br>菲：这三个线圈是双倍尺寸，不是正常的尺寸81，而是像140，在中间，和200的，尺寸如果是双倍的话会有什么影响吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We need Reny, Reny can tell you the information straight away. Yes it does.<br>凯：我们需要瑞尼，他能更为直接的告诉你一些信息，是的，有影响<br>[Rasheed]: so what precautions should I take.<br>菲：有影响，那我需要注意一些什么<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You don’t need it just all depends what to condition you create what you are expecting and what you will see. This structure have you nano coated your red plastics or whatever?<br>凯：你不需要，这取决于你所创造的环境，以及你所期望的，和你所看见的。这个结构，你已经给你的红色的塑料柱子进行纳米涂层了吗？<br>[Rasheed]: Everything is nano coated and also all structure has feedback using the capacitor so everything has feedback if I go close you will see.<br>菲：所有的东西都进行了纳米涂层，所有的结构在使用电容器的情况下都有能量反馈，所有的东西都有能量反馈，我可以给你仔细看<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  Yeah but the frame you have in there isn’t nano coated.<br>凯：是的，但是你那边的架构没有进行纳米涂层<br>[Rasheed]:yeh, So the …<br>菲：是的,所以<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Do you see the, have you started it yet or not?<br>凯：你看见，你开始了还是没有？<br>[Rasheed]: no I was a little concerned or a little cautious about it I just haven’t connected one wire so everything is connected and you can see the feedback there is capacitor at the back which is feedingback  the 2 feedback capacitors feeding back the magnetical to the gravitational.<br>菲：不，我有一些担心，一些在意的事情，我还有一根线没有连接，所以所有东西都连接好了，你能看见能量反馈 ，在后面有电容器，进行能量反馈，这2个进行能量反馈的电容器将能量反馈到磁力然后到引力（03:24:06）。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It’s a nice setup you got there<br>凯：你的设置很好。<br>[Rasheed]: Yeah it can be extended so I can extend the corner unit further out…<br>菲：是的，可以进行延伸扩展，所以我把旁边的线圈单元设置得更远一点<br>[Mr. Keshe]: First of all what I see your bottom 2 cores are too low, your core your first core is too low you gotta be slightly higher  here you gotta be at least another 10 20 cm higher. The last one at the bottom has to start at least 20cm of where it is and push everything else up at the moment its in line with the rest yeah. This should be higher it should be where the 3rd one is more or less.<br>凯：首先，你最下面的2个线圈太低了 ，最下面的线圈太低了，你得将它移上去，至少10到20CM，就是最下面的线圈至少20CM向上移动，整体就能上移了。应该高一点，应该在第三个线圈那里。<br>[Rasheed]: Alright okay that is easy to fix.<br>菲：好的，这容易处理。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okaybecause  there is no way your fields can go to the bottom to fly up, they to be elevating after they feed back on there. It’s a nice system it’s very nice. Thank you very much for sharing with us<br>凯：好，因为你的 磁场没有办法进入底部然后上升，在他们能量反馈后就能得到提升。这是很好的系统，很不错，谢谢你的分享<br>[Rasheed]: Ok so that’s and the winding I have another question is that the thinner wiring how does it impact the system is it less power or is it…<br>菲：好，这是线的缠绕。我还有个问题，就是用更薄的更细的线圈是否会影响到系统，是否产生比较少的能量或者<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Pardon? What?<br>凯：什么？<br>[Rasheed]: thinner cables I mean thinner copper wires<br>菲：更细的线，我的意思是更细的铜线<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Not really it does in a way but on the other hand don’t forget that the wires are just the structure to hold the plasma so thick wires you have more surfaces more plasma. Don’t get fooled by the matter state, understand the structure of the plasma itself. Okay, anymore…thank you come and show us how it works and what you see and what you feel please. Go through when you set up structures like this go through the Keshe foundation to the spaceship side and contact Ali he will guide you through it.<br>凯：并不完全，会有影响，但在另一方面，但不要忘记线只是吸引并固定等离子体的结构，厚的线圈你有更多的面积，更多的等离子体。但不要被物质所迷惑，理解等离子体的结构本身。好的，还有吗？谢谢，做好后，再回来反馈给我们看怎么运行的，你看见了什么，感受到什么。当你设置到这样的结构，去凯史基金会太空网站，联系阿里，他会给你相应的指导<br>[Rasheed]: Okay will do that and<br>菲：好的，会的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Ali is responsible for the side.<br>凯：阿里现在负责这方面的事情<br>[Ali]: sent you my email address in chat.<br>阿里：等一下我会在聊天里发给你我的邮箱<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Don’t put your email address on the chat you gonna get attacked by these…<br>凯：不要在聊天里发邮箱地址，你可能会被其他人攻击<br>[Ali]: no no only the privately and it’s my personal<br>阿里：不是，这是私人的，是我个人的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I am saying no, don’t give your personal you have a Keshe foundation spaceship institute that’s where you do, don’t get involved. I saw you posting it and I was going to tell you afterwards but delete whatever you put on and do not give your private address out. You have a question foundation protect yourself<br>凯：我说不行，不要给你个人的，你现在负责凯史基金会飞船机构，责任重大，不要让你轻易涉进其他事情中，我看见你张贴出去，我本要告诉你的，删除你现在放在上面的，不要给你的邮件地址，你现在代表凯史基金会，你需要保护自己<br>[Ali]: Okay thank you.<br>阿里：好，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much. Okay anything else we have been going on for nearly 3 and a half hours<br>凯：很感谢。好的，还有什么事情吗？我们已经进行了差不多3个半小时<br>[Vivic]: Mr. Keshe its Vivic again, sorry very quick question regarding from many coils that you taught us on Tuesday to re grow the amputated limb 2 questions,<br>微：凯史先生。抱歉，我有一个关于线圈的问题，是您在星期二教学中教给我们的，就是重新使断肢生长的问题，2个问题<br>[Mr. Keshe]: have you tried to do that yet or not?<br>凯：你试着做了没有？<br>[Viviv]: Yes I have he is actually build the mini coils would you like to see?<br>微：是的，他做了这个迷你线圈，你想要看下吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes please this is for the amputation.<br>凯：好的，是为截肢用的？<br>[Vivic]: This is for the amputation I will just open up the image, he has not nano coated it, no he built it. He has not nano coated it yet he has just sent me this picture its on the screen now.<br>微：是为截肢的。我将打开图像，他还没有进行纳米涂层，他寄给我这个图片，现在屏幕上<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You have to nano coat it with copper oxide and CO2 and you can use CH3 if you want this is perfect.<br>凯：你可以对它进行纳米涂层，用氧化铜甘斯，CO2甘斯，如果你想完美可以再加上CH3甘斯<br>[Vivic]: Yes it is very beautifully done sir.<br>微：是的，这样会很好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: actually I think with this size you can use one on its own.<br>凯：事实上这个尺寸的话，你可以使用一个即可<br>[Vivic]: One on its own okay with, then all the ganses will go on to the one coils.<br>微：一个，好，然后所有的甘斯都淋在这个线圈上<br>[Mr. Keshe]: All the coils and the, I tell you what, let’s take the knowledge a step further I am going take, I am going take over to show you something.<br>凯：所有线圈，我来告诉你，我把知识扩展一下，我想要屏幕给你展示一下东西<br>[Vivic]: should I stop the screen share?<br>微：我该关闭屏幕吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Please if you could.<br>凯：请<br>[Vivic]: ok<br>微：好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes I want to continue, okay screen share we put here we change the position you have made the coil yeah and you have 4 legs am I correct?<br>凯：好，我继续，屏幕分享，我放这里，改变状态。你做了这个线圈，有4根伸出的线，是吗？<br>[Vivic]: yes sir<br>微：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay if you can use the finger and these 4 coils in the right position as a support to the finger. You understand?<br>凯：好，这里是手指 ，这4根线处在正确的位置来支持这个手指 ，明白吗？<br>[Vivic]: coil it around the remaining part of the thumb yes<br>微：是，线圈缠绕在剩下的手指上，是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Part of the fingerso as it grows you can move it up but the beauty with this is that the structure on the gans on the coil is got to be not to be touching the skin if you can put just like a what you call clean film on it with the same information as it and it comes through the skin. So the process will be very rapid. So you use the leg of your coil if you make it long enough as a system to hold on to the skin itself and you can just move it up as the finger grow you move it up that way. If it’s not too late you should have been there much earlier. Try to get it back on and make sure you put a clean film on the system after you nano coat it and gansed it just put a small plastic film and keep it with that, it never touches the body yeah.<br>凯：在手指上。当它长出来时，你再向上移动，这个美妙之处是线圈上的甘斯不能接触到皮肤，如果你在上面铺上一层清洁膜，它就会携带同样的信息 （最下一条线），然后会经过皮肤 （中间一条线）（03:29:42）。所以这个过程会加快。所以你使用线圈的长线，如果让它足够长从而作为一个系统包裹着皮肤 ，当手指长出来，你可以向上移动，如果不是很晚和微弱的话，你应该早点放在那里。在纳米涂层和淋上甘斯后确保在系统上放上清洁膜 ，就是一片塑料膜，保持一定距离，不让它触碰身体 。<br>[Vivic]: Yes sir<br>微：好。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Then you should report, take pictures of it what will be very interesting if he is not healed by now still by now to be able to see that you see the bone growing you see everything growing out.<br>凯：然后你应该向我们报告，拍摄图片，有趣的是如果至今还没有治愈，应该能够看见骨头在生长，你看见所有的东西都长出来了<br>[Vivic]; yes sir I have asked him to take pictures as well as if possible make a video and put on YouTube…<br>微：好，我会要求他拍摄图片，同样可能的话，制作视屏，然后放到YouTube上<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Does he have any pain phantom pain?<br>凯：他有幻痛吗？<br>[Vivic]: I have to ask that question<br>微：我得去问问<br>[Mr. Keshe]: the minute he uses this it will disappear.<br>凯：他使用的那一刻就会消失的<br>[Vivic]: Okay sir is there<br>微：好的，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Keep taking picture of it.<br>凯：要拍摄图片<br>[Vivic]: Definitely sir does it matter if the coil is pointing outward or the centre of the coil must be pointing towards the pump.<br>微：肯定的，先生。线圈指向外面还是线圈的中心指向手指？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: the coil if you look at it should be the thumb here and the coil itself has to face it flat face.<br>凯：手指在这里，线圈在这里 ，线圈要面向手指，平面面对手指<br>[Vivic]: okay no problem sir,<br>微：好，没问题<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  there should, it looks it should as if you are putting a plate facing it. Yeah<br>凯：就像一个平板对着它<br>[Vivic]: yes sir<br>微：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: to prove where you pull it out, this I would like to see this because I have seen it as a plate maybe this is much better efficient maybe we can bring the… The gap has no, cannot be more than 2 to 3 mm otherwise the information doesn’t go through. Make sure it comes to the gap. Thanks very much thanks Vivic.<br>凯：像这样放置，我更倾向于看这种方式，因为我把它看做一个盘子，可能会更加有效，可能会带来……线圈与手指之间间距不能超过2到3MM,否则信息无法穿过，确保它能跨越距离，谢谢你<br>[Vivic]: Thank you sir I will ask him to put all the pictures on the Keshe community site.<br>微：谢谢。我会让他拍摄图片放在凯史社区网站<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thank you very much indeed let’s see if he gets a finger if it’s a week now it’s a bit too late but let’s see what we can do.<br>凯：很感谢，让我们看看，是否他能够得到一个新手指，如果已经一个星期了，就有些晚了，让我们看看我们能做什么<br>[Vivic]: okay sir thank you sir<br>微：好，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank very much, thank you. Any other comment anywhere else?<br>凯：谢谢，很感谢。还有其他问题吗？<br>[Rick]: We had Miguel was waiting for a while his microphone wasn’t working before I am wondering if his microphone is working now. Miguel can you try to speak?<br>瑞：米格尔在等待着。他之前麦克风有问题，我想知道是否好了，米格尔，你能讲话吗？<br>[Miguel]: can you hear me?<br>米：能听见么？<br>[Rick]: Yes<br>瑞：是的<br>[Miguel]: this is Miguel Morena from Mexico City,<br>米：我是米格尔，来自墨西哥城<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  thank you thanks for joining us.<br>凯：谢谢你加入我们<br>[Miguel]: I want to talk in behalf of the humanity to thank you for all support that you are giving for the evolution of the cosmos.<br>米：我想要代表人类感谢你，你付出的艰辛与努力，以及为宇宙的进化作出的贡献<br>[Mr. Keshe]: you are welcome<br>凯：不客气<br>[Miguel]: I want to share some devices that I made to …<br>米：我想要分享一些我所做的设备<br>[Mr. Keshe]: let me explain to you, you are from Mexico?<br>凯：让我解释一下，你来自墨西哥？<br>[Miguel]: Yeah I am from Mexico.<br>米：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay maybe I can point out something here and I know it has to be discussed and be brought up. We used to have very good people from Mexico who worked with us and did a lot of Spanish teaching and we find out that the people who work in the dark forces in the background themselves convinced the Mexican group that we are involved in dark magic the way they work and the convinced them to start collaboration with Keshe foundation whose part of the underground network which was going to use people in Austria and they did what they wanted to do. We are aware of what happened hopefully. The Spanish teaching group who they manage to convince that we got involved in dark forces and they put the lies and the cheats is your loss not ours.<br>凯：好的，可能我要指出一些事情，我知道这得不得讨论，而且要提出来。我们以前有来自墨西哥的很好的人与我们一起工作，并且做了大量的教学工作，我们发现其中在背地里工作在黑暗势力的人劝说墨西哥团队涉入黑暗魔法，就像他们所做的一样，并说服他们与凯史基金会合作，他们是地下网络的一部分，这个网络用来利用奥地利的人，这样他们能随心所欲。我们意识到了所发生的。西班牙教学团队他们想方设法说服我们涉入黑暗势力，他们使用谎言与欺骗，这是你们的损失，不是我们的。<br>[Miguel]: Actually we had actually was just checking on the information that they were sharing but they have like some amount, they don’t have anything that is the reason why.<br>米：事实上我们在检查他们所分享的，他们看起来有很多，但其实他们其实什么也没有，这就是原因<br>[Mr. Keshe]: but it is if you want, let me tell you this is why I brought it out. The start the Keshe foundation the way you are doing and what other people are doing and this is done deliberately by the Red Circle of Belgium. They worked heavily on this man they convinced him through the people in Austria that the way the mentality and understanding is in South America that they didn’t want to get involved and these are how they do damage themselves than us.<br>凯：如果你想要，让我告诉你为什么我提出这个。这些人所做的是直接被比利时红圈组织授意的，他们对这个人做了很多工作，他们说服他通过精神上以及所掌握的南美的理解对奥地利的人进行渗透，而他们并不牵涉进来，这就是他们如何损害他们自己甚于我们。<br>The Spanish convince you like you lost that they could not bring the knowledge out because we learned a lot from you. If you know the people who where participating in development and showing things in the Spanish group we give you the chance to re-establish the Spanish group and the work of these guys who work very hard to share the knowledge due to the lack of what do call it language that we can sharewith you they cannot share with us. If you can do come back on and set is off and speak to Vince and bring the development from the Spanish language to us. We know what happened we know exactly how they did how they convinced the gentleman that its black magic but they were actually they were themselves must be understand that way and understanding of the culture of South America they convinced them getting into and it was done heavily work done by, what do you call it by guys in Austria. We know how they did it but this is loss for the Spanish a no body else. Carry on please.<br>凯：他们会说服你使你变迷失，他们不能带来知识，因为我们从你们身上学习很多；如果你知道在西班牙团队中参与发展与展示作品的人，我们给你们机会重新建立起西班牙团队，这些人很努力在分享知识，但由于缺乏语言基础，所以我们能分享你们，你们却不能与我们分享，如果你们能够回来，设立起来，联系文斯，用西班牙语言将新的发展带给我们。我们知道所发生的，他们怎么做的，他们怎么说服这个绅士，用黑暗的魔法，但他们实际上是为自己工作，必须理解这一点，理解南美的文化；他们说服他们进入，一些沉重的工作是由奥地利的一些人做的。我们知道他们如何做的，但这是西班牙的损失，不是其他的。请继续。<br>[Miguel]; Okay so,<br>米：好的<br>[Person]: Miguel I am sorry hello I am also from Mexico City, Miguel hello can we meet? It would be awesome to have somebody to share the knowledge with,<br>某人：米格尔，嗨，我也是来自墨西哥城，你好，我们能见面吗？与某个人一起分享知识将会很好。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes share it on the Spanish teaching we give you the platform.<br>凯：好，在西班牙教学中分享，我们给你一个平台<br>[Miguel]: can I share my screen to some information<br>米：我能有一个屏幕分享一些信息吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes hold on I have tostop  sharing you come on. Yeah<br>凯：好。我这边关闭屏幕，稍等<br>[Rick]: That’s a good idea for Bernard out there, he was saying  he has a lot that he has a lot to offer so maybe he could proud of that Spanish workshop platform.<br>瑞：这对伯纳德来说是一个好主意，他说有很多想要分享出来，他会为这个西班牙教学平台骄傲的<br>[Miguel]: can I …<br>米：我能…..<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can I ask one thing before you go online to show us, is there any copyright things on this what you going to show us.<br>凯：在你展示之前，我能问一件事情吗？在你的展示的东西有任何涉及版权的问题吗？<br>[Miguel]: no no, no actually I want to take this device and I want to give the right for the humanity.<br>米：没有，没有。我想要把这个设备，我想要把这个权利留给人类<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes as your friend said please get in touch with each other and we start the Keshe foundation and Spanish teaching.<br>凯：好，就像你的朋友说的，相互联系，我们可以开始西班牙语教学<br>[Miguel]: Okay so this is the device that I make<br>米：好，这就是我做的设备<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what is that device can you explain to us ?<br>凯：这是什么设备，你能解释给我们听吗？<br>[Miguel]: yeah inside I made some coils with nano material and I put 15% of gans that’s CO2 and I put 82% for the still water and 3% whole Tomatina. Tomatina is a chemical compound that has 50 atoms of carbon 83 atoms of hydrogen and 29 of helium. So the Tomatina health are looked to the nu-meatsystem to be stronger so I went to different hospitals and I went some, some institutes and some hospitals to make some testing and they have, I have very good results I have several testimonials that I am recording to send to the have the proofs that the all the plasma is working and I am going to share right now the camera because I want to show you another…<br>米：是的。在里面我做了一些纳米涂层后的线圈，我放了15%CO2甘斯，放了82%的蒸馏水，还有3%的番茄碱，番茄碱是化学复合物，由50个碳原子，83个氢原子，21个一氧化碳（番茄碱=C50H83NO21，非根据原文，原文说的29个）加入番茄碱可以融入进神经-肌肉系统使其变坚实与强硬，所以我去了一些医院，和一些机构，做了一些检测。我收到很好的结果，我有一些测试报告，我记录下来并发送，有证据表明所有的等离子体正在工作，我想分享一下，在摄像头下，因为我想展示一些其他….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can you tell us how you use this? How do you use this system?<br>凯：你能解释一些如何使用这个，如何使用这个系统？<br>[Miguel]: okay I am using this system in the solar plexus and sometimes like see if some people have the problem for their brains I am putting the device in the pancreasesarea and sometimes I am doing some testing that people can, because I have the chance to give conferences sometimes I am taking 3 or 4 devices, plasma devices with me and I am taking the 6 persons to do some testing sometimes they grab the plasma device with their hands and the feel the energy inside of the body if they have a body like cancer or different parts of the body they are giving  testimony they have experienced. They are having the experience to feel like electricity in the area that need to help.<br>米：好的，我把这个系统用在腹腔神经丛，有时如果有人腹部有疾病，我会放在胰腺的区域，我会做一些测试，因为我有机会开一些会议，我会携带3到4个装置，等离子体装置，会召集6个人做一些测试，他们有时会用手抓住等离子体设备，然后在身体中感觉到能量在流动，如果他们身体有疾病或其他身体部位有问题，他们能够给出测试的报告。他们感觉就像在那些区域有电流一样，需要帮助<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes it does you are correct because I hold the coils when we do sometimes teaching and I have pain in my muscle tissue arm instantaneously disappears but it feels at the point of where the pain is it’s like a huge traffic of energy.<br>凯：是的，你很正确，因为我抓住线圈，在我有时教学时有一些手臂肌肉组织的疼痛，然后立刻消失了，在疼痛的那个部位就像有大量的流动的能量<br>[Miguel]:yes  but it’s true they sometimes they are moving part of the body in both the way because they having like a, they are receiving energy from the plasma device. But right now I am having another device I am going to share my …hold on a second.<br>米：是的。 他们有时候他们移动这个身体的部位，他么就像接受到能量，从等离子体装置里。现在我要展示一些另外一个设备，稍等<br>[Mr. Keshe]: hello?<br>凯：在吗？<br>[Miguel]: so right here because it show the moral device right is the Tomatina compound they all the structures that have an essay. I am doing some testing because I really sure that all the device is interacting with the cellular respiration and it’s in production with the energy of the, the energy of the cells because…<br>米：在。这里 ，这是番茄碱的分子结构，他们也做这样的笔记，我做了一些测试，因为我确信所有的设备都能够与细胞的呼吸系统发生相互反应，从而产生能量，细胞的能量，因为…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: just wait one second can you hold on one second, do we have Renon in the background or has he gone?<br>凯：稍等。稍微停一下。雷农在线吗？<br>[Rick]: Yeah I can’t see him there no.<br>瑞克：没看见他<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Vince can you take all take all the details from element and then pass it on to Renon for the innovation centre to make a blueprint of this and add it to the health blueprint please okay, okay carry one<br>凯：文斯，你能记录下相关的细节，然后发给雷农，为创新中心制作蓝图用，加到医疗健康蓝图里面，（文斯：我会办的）谢谢。继续<br>[Miguel]: okay let me check it out because sites of some, I made also solid gans for CO2 and I am very impressed because they have this shape of cube.<br>米：好的，我来检查一下。我也做了一些固体CO2甘斯，我也很惊讶，它们有这样的立方体的形状<br>[Mr. Keshe]: how did you make these please?<br>凯：你是怎么做出的？<br>[Miguel]: just I put the littleliquid gans incontainer and I left it for maybe 2 days I going to show you. This is like 6 hours after that I put the liquid gans and you could see how the cube are making by themselves<br>米：我把液体甘斯放在容器里，我就放置了2天，我展示给你看，这是6个小时后 ，我放进液体甘斯，你能看见这个晶体是怎么自己产生的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: but can you explain to us how you make this liquid that you get these cubes?<br>凯：你能解释一些你是如何制作这种液体然后得到这些立方体吗？<br>[Miguel]: I made a container with a copper plate with nano coated copper plate and a zinc plate and I put the wire and each little of water and each bit of water I put 15% of salt, that is the way I got the gans of the CO2.<br>米：我做了一个容器，一块纳米涂层铜板，一块锌板，用线连接起来，15%的盐水，这就是我如何得到CO2甘斯的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: but the crystals that’s how I want to know how you made the crystals.<br>凯：但是这个晶体，我想知道你是如何制作出这个晶体的<br>[Miguel]; I didn’t make it they made them by themselves<br>米：我没有制作，它们是自己出现的<br>[Rick]: Did you wash the gans with distilled water.<br>瑞克：你用蒸馏水洗净甘斯吗？<br>[Miguel]: no I didn’t just like we got the water.<br>米：没有。我就是用这个水<br>[Rick]: okay then that salt crystals that’s what you see there. Salt crystals forms cubes like that.<br>瑞：好，你看见的是盐晶体，盐晶体就是那样的<br>[Miguel]: just watch the water, and this way these cubes they were appearing.<br>米：看这里的水 ，这些晶体就是这样出现的<br>[Rick]: Water evaporates then is gets salt crystals form.<br>瑞克：水蒸发，你就得到盐晶体形态<br>[Vivic]; I had the same thing happen in my copper oxide gans when I left it in the container and everything evaporated the salt actually became like that.<br>微：我在氧化铜甘斯里也有同样的东西，我让它留在容器里，蒸发的时候盐就会形成那样形态<br>[Rick]: I have done especially butte salt because there would be gans probably locked into that.<br>瑞：我使用了一些B盐，因为那样甘斯可能会被锁进里面<br>[Miguel]: Right here are the people that are in the university of Italgo and I went to actually one people they asked me to have confidence about the plasma so I went to the university of Italgo to share the knowledge about the plasma and I made also the static reactor and I was playing the, these guys from here they have speeches and they have the experience with the device, with the plasma device and this guys he has problem with the brain, he has very hard problem with the brain because he can move one side entirely he don’t feel the entire half of the body because he has a problem in the brain and when he had experience with the device and this guy told me that have  a belt  in his kneel and he says that he was be able to feel energy in his brain that was very amazing because he says that he has several years without progress and the problem with the  having a very hard pain in his knee so he was very impressed because the pain just entirely 1% gone actually the guy I was talking about was this one, I was confused this one is the guy that has problem with the brain. This guy was problem with the gastritis, I don’t know how to say in English, somebody know how to say gastritis in English? Anybody. </p>
<p>米：这里是在 Italgo大学的一些人 ，事实上有人要求我对等离子体抱有信心，所以我去 Italgo大学来分享等离子体的知识，我也制造了静态反应器，这里我在展示，这些人感受过等离子体装置，都有一些体验，这个头脑有些问题 ，头部有很严重的问题，无法移动身体的一边，他无法感知身体的一半，脑里有问题，当他与装置接触过后，他告诉我他在膝盖有疼痛，他能在头脑里感觉到能量，很神奇，他很多年都没有骨质反应，骨质反应与基因造成在他的膝盖上很大的疼痛，所以他特别惊奇，因为疼痛已经1%完全消失了，实际上我们谈论的是这个人 ，抱歉，这个人是脑里有问题的，刚才说的那个人是有胃炎，我不知道怎么说，有人知道怎么用英语说吗？<br>[Person]: I think you are trying to say gastritis<br>某人：我认为你说的是胃炎<br>[Miguel]: Gastritis that correct and he felt, he felt much better about the health about 20 minutes after the plasma device, Actually I am working hard to share this very important information that gonna help to evolution to the cosmos. So I am going to show you another, okay right here I am doing some tests these flowers actually I have these flowers have more than 18days and they are spread and they still alive so I am going to do another testing and right here I have a heart that I put inside CO2 gans right here and right here there is another device that I made. I put some magnets around the circular device that I made, I think you can see the coils and right here is the liquid, I made this one a transparent way to see the behaviour of the liquid state so I am doing another different testing that I have several testimonials that the people they are having very good improvement in the health. Some people that I have problems with pressure they are going with doctors after some therapies with this plasma device and the doctors are taking out the medications because they having excellent results I am doing some testing too with a person with cancer, person with Leukaemia, actually I am having a really really good results, I have some videos I am going to start translating in English to share this information. </p>
<p>米：胃炎，正确， 他感觉好多了，用了这个等离子体设备20分钟后好多了 ，事实上我是在很努力的分享这些知识，用来帮助宇宙的进化，所以我要展示一下另外的东西，这里我做了一些测试，这些花已经有18天了，由于这个等离子体装置，它们还活着 ，然后我做另外一个测试，这里我有一个罐子，放入CO2甘斯 ，在这里 ，我做了一个磁铁圈绕在上面 ，这里面你能看到线圈 ，是流体，作为一种传输的方式，看流体的表现性能，我做了另一个不同的测试，有一些测试报告，那些使用的人在健康上有很大的改善，医生们如我在使用等离子体装置进行治疗后有一些压力，因为他们可以不使用药物，并且可以取得好的效果，我也在做一些测试，癌症，还有一个白血病患者，事实上我收到了很好的效果，我有一些视屏，我想要翻译出来，分享这些信息。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what I would like you to do, what I have seen here is absolutely fantastic and thank you very much for sharing it with us and we give you the platform to restart the Keshe foundation the Spanish and we …<br>凯：我想要你做的是，我看到你所做的，是十分神奇的，十分感谢与我们分享，我们给你一个平台用来重建凯史基金会西班牙教学<br>[Miguel]: yes I am very proud to be part of your team<br>米：好，我十分自豪，成为你的团队的一员<br>[Mr. Keshe]: speak with Vince and what I have seen the pictures there speak a thousand words. Speak to us after this teaching be careful don’t open any email because they might try to attack you or what ever they way they do from Red Circles in Belgium and Germans do not take anything threats these are bunch of cow boys because we know they come after straight after the teaching I will give you the platform to teach but will give you another platform, if you can organise the teaching in Spanish at the full time base we pay you for it. You employ as a Spanish teacher to the Keshe foundation worldwide.<br>凯：与文斯联系，我们所看见的这些图片胜过千言万语，在教学结束后与我们联系，不要打开任何邮件，他们可能会攻击你，无论什么以什么方式，他们来自比利时红圈和德国，不要被恐吓所吓倒，这些人只是一群儒弱的人，因为我们知道他们在教学后会开始想办法制造破坏。我给你一个平台去教学，是另一个平台，如果你能组织全天西班牙教学，我们会付钱给你。你能够被雇佣作为一个西班牙教师，面向世界上所有的凯史基金会。<br>[Miguel]: okay I…<br>米：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we have very nice people who work in the background we used to have a Spanish student what his name Hohei he was translating the first book into Spanish. You can ask Almin for Hohei  to back you up for the teaching and for the development and the other Spanish people and if you want to set up a teaching centre in space in remote for other Spanish people because we have understood this side very well. We support you to setup the Spanish teaching language maybe it’s a blessing for the others to be what I call black magic by the own thought but don’t choose such beautiful knowledge from you to us. We speak to us in the background. You have to speak to Marco who is head of teaching and organise teaching in Spanish, you don’t need to understand English to be enlightened and if you cannot or we have. Is Almin behind somewhere, I know we have people in Mexico who applied for manufacturing, just stay there online is Almin there?<br>凯：我们在后台有很不错的人在工作，我们以前有一个西班牙学生名叫荷黑，他给西班牙翻译第一本书，你可以联系阿曼与荷黑取得联系，让他帮助你支持教学，为了说西班牙语的人们的发展；如果你想要建立这个教学中心，为在更远的地方讲西班牙语的人，因为我们知道这很有作用。我们支持你建立西班牙语教学，或许这是对那些人的一个祝福与祈祷，那些自以为是的使用黑暗魔法的人，他们不会像我们这样从你那里得到这么美妙的知识。我们可以在后台再继续。你得联系上马可，他负责教学工作，并在西班牙组织教学，你不需要理解英语，如果你不能，我们有办法。阿曼在吗？我知道有一个人申请在墨西哥办工厂，米格尔保持在线，阿曼在吗？<br>[Almin]: Yes Mr. Keshe<br>阿曼：在，凯史先生。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Almin do we have a manufacturing application from Mexico?<br>凯：阿曼，我们有一个来自墨西哥的办工厂的申请吗？<br>[Almin]: I don’t think so.<br>阿曼：我认为没有<br>[Sylvester]: Mr. Keshe this is Sylvester<br>谢：凯史先生，我是谢福斯特<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what we ganna doing with manufacturing funds towards you  you can setup the whole structure towards teaching and university and whatever. Just stay online lets just check background.<br>凯：我们想要把办工厂的资金投向你，这样你可以建立起整个结构，针对教学，宇宙或者其他什么，请稍等，我在后台检查一下<br>[Miguel]: I want to share another…<br>米：我想要分享一下另一个….<br>[Almin]: I don’t thinks so Mr. Keshe<br>阿曼：我不这样认为，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay we have to support it from outside but speak to Marco to support you with the teaching and standing  on the education side so we setup the teaching for you in Spanish that you can teach people can go into it and most probably the Spanish Keshe foundation.org will support you to teach. Vince can you organise that please. Okay thanks, keep the track and bring it up and see where we are going to go. Okay share with us please.<br>凯：好。我们得从外部来进行支持，但是请联系马可，让他帮助你，进行教学，站在教学的一边，我们用西班牙语为你建立起教学，你能为人们进行教学，可能会建立Spanish Keshe foundation.org ，这个网站能够支持你进行教学。文斯，你能帮忙组织一下吗？好的，谢谢，保持记录，并且分享给我们，来看看我们能走到哪里。好的，请继续与我们分享。<br>[Miguel]: I want to share another idea that I am going make in this make month. I am gonna make a cube for the human transportation.<br>米：我想要分享另外一个想法，我准备在这个月制作。我想要制作一个立方体作为人类传输（传送系统）。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: of what?<br>凯：什么？<br>[Miguel]: for the 0 time transportation that you were talking about the piece in 2 workshops before do you remember that they have like  geometry with some reactors? Just said that we have 6 coils one is top one on the bottom one on each side we can make 0 time transportation so right now I am working with  this idea I sent to make a cube to put all the coils in each side to make with.<br>米：作为零延迟传输系统，你在以前两次教学都谈论过这个部分，你还记得，他们展示过一个像几何状的反应器吗？6个线圈，顶部一个，底部一个，其他面各一个，我们能制作零延迟传送系统，现在我正在实现这个想法，我要制作一个立方体，然后把线圈放上去<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay let’s direct you in the right place you have a lot support. Ali are you online or have you finished for today. He must have gone to sleep.<br>凯：好的，让我们指导你走向正确的方向，你有很多这样的支持。阿里，你在线吗？还是已经下线了。他一定去睡觉了。<br>[Rick]: he is still online as far as being here I am not sure .<br>瑞克：他还是线上，但我不肯定<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I think we got to direct him to Ali that he can …<br>凯：我认为要让他直接与阿里取得联系<br>[Ali]: Hi Mr. Keshe yes I’m online.<br>阿里：你好，凯史先生，我在线<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Ali can you speak to this gentleman that you can give him support because he is trying to do a transportation unit. Okay please pick up his things and bring him as park of Keshe foundation space unit and the teaching<br>凯：阿里，你能联系这个先生，这样你就能给予它支持，因为他想要做一个传输单元。（阿里：好的）好的，关注他的事情，把他带入进来，作为凯史太空季候的一部分，还有教学<br>[Ali]; and how is the best way for him to reach me should he an email to webmaster or?, Okay Vince I will let you.<br>阿里：怎样才是最好的方式让他联系我，是让他发邮件到网站吗，还是？（文斯：我会处理的）好的，文斯，让你来<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay thank you very much. Carry on sir<br>凯：好的，很感谢，请继续<br>[Miguel]; This is the cube that I made because I want create a space ship but before that I made design to have a cube and in 2 last workshops you were talking about could be are very important to make the main plasma in centre to the 0 time transportation so right now I working this stuff because I want to start working to, create the aircraft.<br>米： 这就是我做的立方体，我想要制作太空飞船，但在这之前，我做了这样的设计图，以此构建立方体，里面的知识是你在过去2次教学中所讲的，这些知识是十分重要的，用以制造这个中心的主源等离子体 （鼠标所点），以达到零延迟传输的目的，所以现在我正在制作这个东西，因为我想要开始工作制作宇宙飞船。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thank you very much, we all achieve it through different ways according to our knowledge and none of us is wrong. So it’s very nice to see the work and what you are doing and if you don’t have a job you can become the teacher of Keshe foundation.<br>凯：十分感谢，我们根据我们的知识通过不同的方式和途径实现同一个目的，没有人是错的。所以很高兴看到这个的作品以及你做的。如果你没有工作，你可以成为凯史基金会的一名老师。<br>[Miguel]: Thank you very much.

It’s about to become huge and then we allow you we give you the platform on the Spanish.keshefoundation.org to make your own website and bring all the teaching and if you want you will let me know and then I come to teach with you when you are teaching in Spanish.<br>凯：马可负责教学。文斯会帮助你进来。阿曼会让你和荷黑取得联系，如果＆黑还在那里的话，世界上所有将西班牙语的人会连接到凯史基金会，我们会建立西班牙凯史基金会网站，我们给你一个脸书或者网站，所有都是西班牙语化，我们给你一个平台去教学，因为你不仅在讲话，还给我们看图片，你是一个意识上高度合一的人，在进行正确的教学，所以我们需要你这样的人对西班牙语区进行重点教学，语言是一个信仰，不是所有的东西都应该用英语，所以在教学结束后，他们立刻这样跟我说。我们会支持你建立西班牙语凯史基金会教学，一个星期7天或者5天或者其他时间。这会变得越来越庞大，我们给你这样的平台，在Spanish.keshefoundation.org 这个网站上，用来制作你自己的网站，进行所有的教学，如果你还有什么其他需要，请让我知道。当你用西班牙语进行教学时，我可以给你教学。<br>[Danny]: Miguel our first tutor in Mexico man, I am happy for you congratulations<br>丹尼：米格尔，我们的第一个墨西哥的导师，很为你感到高兴。<br>[Miguel]: I am happy right here so …<br>米：我也很高兴。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we need a lot of teachers in Spanish we need a number of teacher some in plasma some in space and other directions we need to gather knowledge seekers of the Spanish langauage that we can share the knowledge we enjoy sharing the knowledge with a lot of Spanish people from Mexico and now we have come once a person like you we appreciate thanks for your time and hopefully somehow all the gaps it getting filled up.<br>凯：我们需要大量的西班牙语教师，我们需要很多的老师，一些在等离子体层面，一些在太空技术层面，一些在其他方向，我们需要把讲西班牙语的知识寻求者聚集起来，这样我们能与来自墨西哥城的人们一起分享知识，也享受分享知识。现在我们有一个像你这样的人，我们很感谢你带来的，希望在某种程度上这能够弥合所有的隔阂。<br> I have to explain to you if you are Italian citizen of the Keshe foundation from now on it will be announced most probably it already has been announced by Juwani Keshe foundation teaching centre in Barletta is open to Italian knowledge seeker who want to do the workshop we try to do it from February please make sure you register in the Keshe Italian website to be, there is, I put a course for weekend teaching courses there will be some practical works because that’s how Juwani  works.<br>凯：我要向你们解释一下，如果你是凯史基金会的意大利成员，从现在开始，宣布，或许已经被朱万妮宣布了，在巴勒塔的凯史基金会教学中心将会对意大利的想要进入教学中的知识寻求者开放，我们会在2月开始，请确保你在意大利凯史网站上注册了，我安排了一个周末的教学课程，有一些实际的作品，因为这就是朱万妮进行工作的方式。<br>But you cannot attend just because you register your name has to be cleared your name has to go through the security clearance on the regular basis and no anyone who is not or does not carry a clearance code will not be allowed in but we have started teaching in Italian with the facilities we have we can carry out between 90-100 people per lecture plus what I call live development and testing with Juwani and Fabio and the beautiful couple who are there and are couple and that the teaching will carry on, there will like a Saturday Sunday in the hand of the Italian people who are in charge with Juwani and team there so we are giving grounds that the English language does not become the only ground for teaching and learning the technology.<br>凯：但是如果你不能加入的话，因为你虽然注册了，你的名字要进行检测，你的名字要定期进行安全的检测，没有携带安全代码的人是不能进入的，但我们已经开始了与机构之间合作的在意大利的教学，每次教学能够容纳90到100个人，由朱万妮和菲比主持的现场的技术扩展与测试，这对夫妇在那里主持这样的教学，星期六与星期天交给意大利的人们，朱万妮的团队来负责，我们来提供并支持这样的平台，英语不是唯一的教学并学习这项科技的条件。<br>Keshe foundation centre in Barletta is open to Italian public we are and Italian organisation who are based in Italy we proud we are in that city and please go to the Italian website register and if you want to do the workshops or the teachings or share knowledge register with the Keshe foundation Italy whatever you want is open it up he has to put the application on the website and then you can attend workshops and gradually we try to bring a full time teaching course and then Monday to Friday as the English version in Italy in Barletta. Barletta becomes the Italian speaking as much as the English speaking centre. And this way language barrier goes away and it becomes part of the united nation as one nation and one planet the same is with the Spanish we encourage you to join us to teach that the Spanish speaking the language does not become the reason to be behind.<br>凯：凯史基金会在巴勒塔 的中心是对意大利公众开放的，我们是意大利的组织，坐落在意大利，我们为那个城市感到骄傲，请去意大利网站完成注册，如果你想要去工作组或者教学组或者分享知识，注册意大利凯史基金会网站，你所需要的都会开放，他应该把申请放在网站上了，你能进入工作组，我们会逐步的带来全时的教学过程，星期一到星期五作为意大利巴勒塔的英语教学时间，同样与英语教学一样在巴勒塔的意大利语教学也是同步进行；这样，语言的障碍就会消失，这就成为联合国家的的一部分，所有国家作为一个国家和一个星球的一个步骤，西班牙语也是一样的，我们鼓励你们加入到我们，参与西班牙语的教学，语言不能成为人们落在后面的原因。<br>We have come to an agreement with the Chinese community the same. Lisa has headed the new development of new the teachings in China and after Chinese New Year it will be fantastic to have you on board we still need to open French speaking school teaching. All the teaching will be headed by Marco at the centre you can take off the teaching after week teaching in English translate it if you want or subtitle it if you want in any language you want and on the same processes as what we do in the centre. Students can listen to it in any time they like as a what do you call it free student. We are trying to close present teachings as you speak or as you say which mean we don’t want to have people to be present in teachings in that way we cause a lot of people to move half way around the ball to classes to sit down there being problem with family being separated and the rest. This way the teaching becomes immediate international and people enjoy it while there are doing it.<br>凯：同样，我们与中国团体达成协议。在中国新年后丽萨负责中国教学的新发展，把你们带上来这会很奇妙。我们还需要开设法语教学课程。所有的教学是由中心的马可负责的，你能在一周教学结束后翻译成你自己国家的语言，可以标上字幕，我们在中心也是这样做的。学生能够根据自己的喜好在任意时间学习课堂的内容，这就是自由的学生。我们会关闭现场讲课，就像你们说的，这就意味着我们不需要人们到现场来，这样避免人们大老远跑来，离开家庭和熟悉的环境所造成的问题（可能指的是太空学院的现场课堂的授课停止）。我们的教学方式会以即时的全球化方式传播知识，当人们在做单元的时候，就享受其中。<br>So if you want to carry on the teachings of the Keshe foundation will go on these places we need will to open the French side. We need to open the teachings in Portuguese we need to open the teaching in Hindu and Panjab. These are the developments we are supporting we will finance the teachers we pay for the teachers who teach we understand the great international 40 Euro per hour. So when somebody teaches in Chinese this is the fee they will be paid for the time they are teaching with the same for Africa the same rate as for being in the United States the teaching unites states until we try bring you to Mike Nasser as he has a lot of experience and he can back it up. We will try to bring you teaching centres in theVenezuelaWe register these as teaching centres not just because you are there we need to setup companies as teaching centres.<br>凯：所以如果你想要进行凯史基金会的教学，凯史基金会会在这些地方进行下去。我们需要进行法语方面的课程，我们需要葡萄牙语的教学，我们需要印度和旁遮普开始教学，我们支持这些发展，我们会支持教师，给予他们薪水，教师的薪酬我们会按照国际上统一的标准40欧元每小时，所以在中国教学的教师，他们被支付的薪酬按时间来就是这样的，在非洲也是一样，在美国也是一样。在美国的教学中心，我们会把你们带到麦克-纳赛尔那里，他有很多经验，他能提供支持。我们也在委内瑞拉建立教学中心，我们建立这些教学中心不仅是因为你在那里，我们需要建立起公司的形式作为教学中心。<br>[Miguel]; I going to be very happy to be working with the team.<br>米：我将很高兴与这个团队在一起工作<br>[Mr. Keshe]: you are working for the humanity you are welcome to the humanity team<br>凯：你是在为整个人类服务，欢迎来到人类的团队<br>[Miguel]: Just to let you know right now over here in Mexico I am half knocking doors in the universities in the institutes in the hospitals to share this knowledge<br>米：你要知道，现在我在墨西哥，我去各个大学，医院还有机构去分享这个知识<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what you mean<br>凯：你的意思是？<br>[Miguel]: yeah right now I am doing the, this job already I am going to the hospital to share this knowledge with the doctors<br>米：是的，现在我做的这个工作，已经，我去医院和医生分享这些知识….<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  I think I understand.

I have took pictures and videos I will email to you shortly so I saw these kids and I said earlier everyone has very in attention but their bodies their physically, nothing is broken their mentally. There is nothing working for them there is a sitting staring at the walls no one will come none of the can even sit up straight some are like 18 years and as I check with the sister there they are saying for 18 years they just  lying down. I don’t know I just gave my address and told about Keshe and I have showed Facebook about you also so that they post it. We are not allowed to take pictures or video so, so its sad to feel so much of the things after the fire saw it on the internet and they know I show you and they allowed me to take pictures. So I want to know what can do for them.<br>拉：我刚从儿童收容所回来，我拍了照片，而且录制了视屏，等下就发给你。我看见这些孩子，就像我先前说的，每个人都很关注，他们的身体，物理部分没有受损，但精神上却没有正常工作，他们就坐在那里盯着墙，没有人向我走来，也没有人起身，一些人像是18岁，我仔细看了看这对姐妹，他们说有18岁，她只是躺着，我不知道，我给他们我的地址，告诉他们关于凯史基金会的事情，我在脸书上展示了关于你的事情，这样他们就可以在上面分享。我不被允许拍照或者录制视屏，我试着说服他们，他们在网站上看到了相关的事情，他们知道我要展示给你看，然后他们就让我拍下照片。所以我想知道我能为他们做什么。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: the thing is we have to consider case by case. We have to see case by case we will see what can be done if it can make one or 2 units that it can be used collectively by number of them that we can allow them to be able to walk to be able to regain ability to walk and our people who came back them up. One of the problems with the people who been paralysed like this for life time for a long time is the muscle tissues are not working as they should do and they go to a lot of pain once you start establishing these and because of the pain they stop doing it or do you want to proceed.<br>凯：这件事情我们得具体分析。我们必须具体看一下来决定做些什么，如果我做1个或2个单元，被他们中许多人一起来使用，我们就能够让他们能够走起来，能够获得行走的能力，我们的人能够过来提供帮助。这些瘫痪一生或者很长时间的人的一个问题是肌肉组织没有像正常情况那样工作，如果你一旦开始为他们建立起这个治愈系统，他们就会有很大的疼痛，因为疼痛他们会拒绝进行治疗或不想要进行这个进程。<br>So we have to be able to, now we have extended the knowledge to use  system like CO2 pads in conjunction with the seized to alleviate the pain. This is know careful and been a very correctly I have had the case of people being paralysed and then we, it works effectively but the problem is the pain is so much that because, if you leave your arm for let’s say three days and you don’t move it you try to bend it see how painful it is the same with these people you have to study case by case. I tried to find somebody to collaboratewith  you that we gather a base frame of how they are paralyzed if you can categorize them in which category they sit and them if we can help or what we see the ones which is the most possibility to be able to have to move we take on immediately. This process costs not much of time but it cost a lot of patience to see them walking it takes about 3 to 6 months and they start walking step by step.<br>凯：所以我们要能够扩展这个知识，使用像CO2这样的系统，并与治愈靠椅结合起来，从而减少治愈中出现的疼痛。这是要很小的，要正确的运行，我遇到过瘫痪的案例，这样的系统很有效，但问题是疼痛是如此巨大，因为，如果你让你的手臂进行三天治疗，你一直不移动，而一旦你试图弯曲，就会产生很大的疼痛，这些人也会是一样的，你必须要具体情况具体分析。我们试着寻找某些人与你一起合作，我们要整理出一个信息框架，他们是怎么瘫痪的，如果你能将他们具体分类，我们能够帮忙，看看哪些人最可能移动起来，我们就会立即给予治疗，整个进程不会花费很长时间，但需要很大的耐心，直到看见他们走路；大概需要3到6个月，他们就能一步步走起路<br>[Nemada]: yes sir seeing them laying down for the rest of the life would be begin to wait for 6 -8 months. If they say cerebrum problems I have no idea what no idea what other things related to brain damage or something like that.<br>拉：比起躺着过一生，6到8个月是值得等待的。他们有的说是大脑问题，如帕金森，我不清楚还有什么事情是与大脑受损联系在一起的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes let’s see what it is some of these you cannot help the damage is beyond our development compared to 2-3 years ago is better than. We can help more. Can you share with us please.<br>凯：让我看看是什么，其中一些你无能为力，一些损伤超出治愈能力，或许我们再继续发展2到3年后就能够治愈。我们能够提供帮助，你能分享一些东西吗？<br>[Nemada]: The photos?<br>拉：照片？<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  yes please.<br>凯：是的<br>[Rick]; I see Carl also is online too Mr. Keshe,<br>瑞克：我看见考萨在线，凯史先生，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I can see him about that.<br>凯：我能看见<br>[Namada]: actually I just came from, I just came just one hour back so I have to be there to my system and …<br>拉：事实上我刚回来，刚回来一个小时，我得到我的系统那里…<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  what you want to do properly that we don’t expose anything and come back on Tuesday<br>凯：你想要更恰当做的话，我们不会公开任何东西，你可以在星期二回来<br>[Namada]: Yes sir I did just came so …<br>拉：是的，我只是刚来…<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  it will be better that trying just to show something<br>凯：展示出一些东西会更好<br>[Namada]: Yeah sure better sign, I don’t have anything in my system I was still trying to upload it.<br>拉：是的，看见更好，我在系统里没有任何东西，我要去下载<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  it fantastic my wife is following  you minute by minute more or less<br>凯：很奇妙，我的妻子几乎每时每刻关注你的情况<br>[Namada]: yes yes<br>拉：是的 ，是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  I have seen the pictures, you have sent<br>凯：我看见了你发的照片<br>[Namada]: I was able to send only the pictures not the videos it was little bit large file so I am try to.<br>拉：我仅仅能发送照片而不是视屏，这是一个很大的文件，所以我试着来做<br>[Mr. Keshe]: is it okay video to show?<br>凯：能够展示了吗？<br>[Namada]: Yeah yeah sure.<br>拉：是的，可以<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what do you do for living if you don’t mind me asking?<br>凯：如果你不介意的话你能说说你以什么为生吗？<br>[Namada]: I don’t, actually I am follow this one for 5 month, actually was working for software for 10 years lost the job so I was still taking care of my kids<br>拉：事实上我接触这个科技只有5个月，我是一直在一家软件公司工作，工作了10年，然后我失去了工作，所以现在我照顾我的孩子<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay I tell you something speak to Vince I know Vivic is working with you maybe we can bring you in as part of the Keshe foundation India for teaching and support.<br>凯：好的，我来告诉你，联系文斯，我知道维微克现在与你一起工作，我们能够将你带入印度凯史基金会作为其中一部分，作为教学和支持的一部分<br>[Namada]: Sure sir thank you very much<br>拉：好的，很感谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  I will be speaking to you myself personally next few day we have got a lot of things happening okay this is one pictures I see a little girl<br>凯：在接下来几天我会亲自与你联系，我们有很多事情需要处理，好，这个其中一个照片，我看见一个小女孩。<br>[Namada]: yeah it’s a baby one just one year old and she can’t even lift her head on her own, she looks perfectly fine I saw her legs it’s all fine but this is to say she can’t even. She won’t turn back her or move any of her parts. She can’t move here body. They say that if they don’t give the physiotherapy every day they become rigid.<br>拉：是的，婴儿，只有一岁，她不能自己抬起自己的头，她看起来很好，我看见她的腿都是好的，但是她不能转身，或者移动自己的任何部分。她不能移动自己的身体。他们说如果不每天给她进行物理治疗，就会变僵硬。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: These are brain damage let us see more pictures we need to look at this thoroughly. Yes these are brain damage. We have experience with this Caroline and I we have a very good experience with this. We had the twins in Belgium and we supported and they changed over 3-4 months they do not ever come fully but we can make them mobile. You got to understand you got to collect the data we had a child exactly like this we called it the carpet, he was like a carpet rolled up they stay that way and the 2nd night of the use of the system they used to put like copper roll on the bed and the second that she fell of the bed they have never seen her moving and she was 5 years old. And we saw her we used to call her commando then she would drag herself pull herself and then she started walking with legs. This is a. You have to get to understand why and how the body is the condition. This is not the paralysis from the leg this is the lack ofdevelopment of the brain structure. This is needs understanding case by case yes, yeah we have, we need a doctor in India do we have doctor in India who supports us 2 or 3 of them in India I have to look into the files we need the doctors to report to us exactly what it is. This needs a full medical understanding and then we need the support of Renon research centre to build up helmets. They support usually through. You have redevelop the brain and there is a way to do it. We have accepted the case we seen in past few days past couple of weeks. Can you, how far is this place for you from where these are?<br>凯：这是大脑受损 ，让我看看更多的照片，我们需要仔细看一遍， 是的，是大脑受损，我们经历过相关的案例 ，我和卡洛琳经历过，在比利时有一对双胞胎，我们对他们进行治疗，在3到4个月后，情况得到改善，但没有完全恢复，但是我们能让他们移动，你要明白你要收集相关的数据，我们遇到过一个像这样的孩子，我们叫她地毯，因为他像一个地毯一样卷起来，他一直保持那样的姿势，第二天晚上我们给她使用这个系统，他们常把像铜球一样的东西放在床上，第二天我们看见她从床上掉下来，他们从来没有看见她移动过，她有5岁了。我们看见她，就会叫她突击队员，她就会拉拽自己，开始用脚走路。你要弄明白她的身体是为何成为这样以及目前的状况。这不是来自腿部的瘫痪，是来自大脑结构的缺失性发展。这需要具体的分析与理解，是，我们需要一个在印度的医生，我们在印度有医生吗？谁能帮助我们？需要在印度2到3人，我需要查一下相关的文件，我们需要医生来具体报告这是怎么回事。需要完全的医疗解读，然后我们需要雷农研发中心的支持，开发出头盔。他们常常能够这样提供支持。你必须要使她的大脑得到发展，有一种办法。在过去几天，介个星期我们收到看到过这样的案例。这个地方离你住的地方多远？<br>[Namada]: Its 14km from my place.<br>拉：14KM离我的住处<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  14<br>凯：14<br>[Namada]: yeah<br>拉：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay try to find a medical doctor locally that understands the problem can monitor the children who can understand the technology. And we pay for the doctor we bring him on employment of the Keshe foundation. We pay his wages that he can move into this place full time and we pay for him to monitor and help the children out those and then we establish a line with him directly. So the innovation centre is more than happy to assist.<br>凯：好的。试着找一个当地的医生，能够理解这个问题，能够对孩子整个过程进行监控，能够理解凯史科技。我们会给这个医生支付报酬，我们会把他纳入凯史基金会雇佣体系，我们付给他工资，他能够搬到这里进行全时的监测，我们付钱给他进行管理，帮助孩子走出困境，我们会与他建立直接联系。所以创新中心很高兴能够提供帮助。<br>[Namada]: The orphanage itself has a physiotherapist and the doctor who she also comes every Monday so they have specific tablet they have to take so they have a list.<br>拉：这个孤儿有一个物理治疗师，这个医生也是每个星期一过来，他们都有指定的药片需要服用，所有他们有一个清单。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: you will find out most of the tablets will disappear to our experience. We need to see, we need the doctor from outside somebody from understand somebody who have to teach somebody who work of the foundation, that can bring in and follow our procedure. They can carry on using the medicine they take then the doctors will decide in time that they don’t need whatever they want to reduce but try to find a local doctor who understands the Keshe foundation technology and can teach them slightly. And we can then bring them on the Keshe foundation international we pay for him to be a doctor for this and if he is see the correct results in the outcome we make him centre for the because for any other, a lot of children like this cannot be the only centre.<br>凯：根据我们的经验，你会发现大部分药片都会消失，我们需要一个来自外面的医生，一个能够理解的人，一个能够教学的人，一个能够与基金会合作的人，能够带进来，按照我们的步骤来。他们能够继续使用药片，这样那些医生就会迟早决定认为他们不再需要了，就会减少药量，尽量找一个当地的医生，能够理解凯史基金会的技术，你能稍微教一些。我们就可以把他们带入凯史基金会国际组织里，我们付给他报酬，如果他能够看见积极的效果，我们会使他成为中心的一员，因为在印度有大量的像这样的孩子，不能仅仅在中心做。<br>[Namada]: Yes sir will try to get something but I can go but we need a doctor for full time who can stay there.<br>拉：是的，先生，我会去办一下，但是我们需要一个全时的在那里的医生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes we need a full time doctor to be able to. Speak with doctors or the physiotherapy if it should they have doubte have it but the, you find a direct and correct collaboration with the people in the hospital in the orphanage. You understand so we don’t wish, we shouldn’t go against, if you speak to the doctor which look after them analyse how she works and who she is and if she has a full time job but if she a doctor if she comes there to check and you explain to her what we do and what is the possibilities and see if she would like to work for the foundation if even  on the part time but the way we want and part of her knowledge we provide the equipment and the knowledge and she does DE monitoring.<br>凯：是的，我们需要全时的医生才能够做到。跟那些孤儿院照料孤儿的医生或物理理疗师谈话，他们会对你的工作产生怀疑，你得找到一个直接的和正确的合作方式，与这些孤儿院的人，你明白吗？我们不希望产生对抗，跟那些照料这些孤儿的医生讲，分析这些医生如何工作，知道这些医生是谁，如果这个照料者有全职的工作，是一个医生，如果她来到孤儿院去检查，你就解释给她听，解释相关的可能性，看她是否愿意为基金会工作，即使是兼职，我们需要这样的方式；基于她的知识，我们会提供相关的设备和知识，让她做测试检查。<br>[Namada]: Yes sir<br>拉：好的，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: it will be fantastic to see, this we will go, we will go to the point of some of them being able to work and intelligence progress is very rapid in each kind of children or we will not succeed in some. You can see what’s the succeed of the, lack of core as I call in the communication line of the brain. The physical side is connected these are usually when the electrical side a connected with the mechanical part as they call it. And the Keshe foundation plasma system is made for this kind of diseases. Literally is made for this things you will see children will move. I have seen it many times, Just organise it and we will try and centre and with that get to Philippine research centre to build up systems. You have what’s his name to build up systems what’s his name Abena, is Abena near you or is he far from you?<br>凯：这会很神奇，我们会实现这一点：他们中一些孩子能够走路，而且每个孩子放入智力会发展很快，或者只有一些孩子没有发展。你能看见大脑中用于沟通的通讯线的中枢得到修复和发展，物理部分是与其相联系的，也就是电流（神经系统）是与机械（物理组织）联系在一起的。而且凯史基金会的等离子体技术就是为这些疾病准备的，你会看见孩子开始移动，我见过很多次了，组织一下，我会和中心联系，促使菲律宾研发中心把相关系统建立起来。他的名字是，阿比拿，阿比拿离你近吗，或者离你比较远？<br>[Namada]: yeah sir he in another start he is in Kethla I am another near Mumbai he is in Kethla he is a little far away from me.<br>拉：是的，他在另一个州，他在Kethla，我在另一个州孟买附近，他在Kethla，离我有些远<br>[Mr. Keshe]: he can do the systems for you Abena has been part of the Keshe foundation and, another one is called Keton yeah if I am correct<br>凯：他能为你做出系统，阿比拿是凯史基金会的一员，还有一个人是可顿，是吗<br>[Namada]: Keton yeah.<br>拉：可顿，是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  its big is it near you?<br>凯：他离你近吗？<br>[Namada]: I haven’t spoken to Keton I haven’t spoken in Lundon i will get in touch.<br>拉：我还没有联系过可顿，但在是伦敦我们讲过话，我会联系一下<br> [Mr. Keshe]: I get Caroline to organise because they can build the systems we can both of them how to build the systems for use on there, we don’t need to bring from Philippine but the group in Philippine can do the prototype so that they can follow<br>凯：我会让卡洛琳去组织一下，因为他们能建立这个系统，怎么建造，然后在那里运用这个系统，我们不需要从菲律宾运过去，但菲律宾的团队可以做出模型，然后他们能够照着做<br>[Namada]: thanks sir<br>拉：谢谢，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  because Renon is in touch with Abina now for a long time we are now aware of it. We will back you up with this just try to find now the, we need the support of a doctor inside and you can tell the doctor this is what we want to do it isshe  open minded and explain to her, you are prepared to pay for her but not to pay employ her of the Keshe foundation the structure and see how you go, we see how far we go.<br>凯：因为雷农已经与阿比拿联系很长一段时间了，我们知道。我们会给你提供支持，试着找，我们需要孤儿院里面医生的支持，你能告诉这个医生这是什么以及我们想要做什么，如果她比较开明，就解释给她听，可以将她纳入凯史基金会的结构中，看你能走到哪一步，我们能够走多远<br>[Namada]: yes sir sure sure.<br>拉：好的，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much for your time.<br>凯：很感谢你带来的<br>[Namada]: Thank you sir<br>拉：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We will see you on Tuesday when you can teach us more. Thank you very much indeed. Is anything or are we finished for today.<br>凯：我们希望在星期二看见你，你来可以教给我们更多。很感谢，还有其他的事情吗，或者我们准备结束今天的教学。<br>[Rick]: Well Mr. Keshe there is always more questions and more things to present<br>瑞克：凯史先生，总有很多问题，总有很多东西需要展示。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I see our friend from Tuesday afternoon<br>凯：我看见我们的朋友，星期二下午的那个<br>[Rick]: would you like to…<br>瑞：是的，你愿意<br>[Mr. Keshe]: let him enlighten us he always enlightens at the end of the day.<br>凯：让他启发我们，他总是在最后启发我们<br>[Rick]: Yeah that might be a lovely ending<br>瑞克：那将会是很好的结尾<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah carry on<br>凯：好，继续<br>[Rick]: Calstal would you like to speak and show your video there?<br>瑞克：考萨，你愿意讲话吗，可以展示你的视屏<br>[Calstal]: yes I have been busy lately with the…<br>考：是的，我最近一直很忙<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I know but let me speak to you, let me warn if you work with Keshe foundation and the way you do, do not worry about how the threaten you I have seen it but please do not use language you use that doesn’t fit us. You understand.<br>凯：我知道，我来说一下，我提醒一下，如果你在凯史基金会的框架下工作，按照你现在做的，不要担心那些威胁，我见过了，但是请不要随心所欲的来，那样不适合我们，你明白吗？<br>[Calstal]: yes Iits seeming picture what you are talking about exactly…<br>考：是的，很清楚<br>[Mr. Keshe]: please understand stay with the ethos of the Keshe foundation. I have seen your video I know your frustration, I know you don’t understand the threats you don’t care about this what call red circle I have seen you putting the what they sent you on the internet but language is not needed<br>凯：请理解要在凯史基金会的理念与框架下工作，我看过你的视频，我知道你的挫折，我知道你不理解这些威胁，你不在意所谓的红圈，我看见他们在网上寄给你的东西，但你说的那些语言是不必要的<br>[Calstal]: Yes Sir I will redo the video and remove…the intelligence has talked to me what to do it the relevancy of the goal.<br>考：是的，先生，我会重新修改视屏，并且移除….这个智能装置已经告诉我怎么去做，以及这与目标之间的联系<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  thank you very much tell us what you have.<br>凯：很感谢，告诉我们你要展示什么<br>[Rick]: can you share your video there Calstal?<br>瑞克：你能展示你那里的视屏吗？考萨？<br>[Calstal]; okay you canstart the video because the host has to …<br>考：好，你能打开这个视频，因为主机…..<br>[Rick]: I have to do some old magic there.<br>瑞：我得做一些古老的魔法<br>[Mr. Keshe]: now we see what you put out of the box this time Rick.<br>凯：呵呵呵。现在我们看见你把什么从盒子里拿出来了，瑞克<br>[Rick]: Well the box is full after allisnt<br>瑞克：毕竟盒子已经满了，不是吗？<br>[Calstal]: Well I got 3 gifts to give to you if you don’t mind. One is the blueprint I ran it to the plasma intelligence and it give me of theblueprint of version you wanted for the people who love to coil and I hosted on the  golden gans, I posted it last night me and John<br>考：凯史先生，我有3个礼物要送给你，，如果你不介意的话。一个是蓝图，我去等离子体智能那里，它给了我你想要的蓝图，为那些喜爱线圈的人准备的，我把它发到甘斯的黄金时代上面，我昨晚上传的，还有约翰<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  you have to send let’s just say if done such a thing please sent it to Renon that is goes on the blueprint on the Keshe foundation.<br>凯：你需要发送，让我说，请联系雷农，就会把它放在凯史基金会的蓝图上<br>[Calstal]: I send to Philippine, I sent it he is already have it, I sent it to<br>考：送到菲律宾？他已经有了，我发送到<br>[Mr. Keshe]: it was on the blueprint on the Keshe foundation website.<br>凯：已经在凯史基金会网站的蓝图上了<br>[Calstal]: I ask the intelligence specifically how for  people to make simpler Magrav where they can take an efficient form where they can take you know like a saleeach set of coil will have on  self-powering even can takedifferent coil now so power the plasma energy and they  can stack the way they want and it just forms either a shape either communication but have to make lot of the plasma cube plasma Magrav cube now and they have ability the freedom to create different formation they want  I  believe some of your student has the blueprint and they know exactly what I mean they see the shape of it and one of your student John call him John Lee on Facebook but his real name is John Little something you have he made the system also and he collaborated with me in the intelligent to create 3-D rendering and then there was another guy<br>考：是的。我仔细问了智能装置，人们怎样制作出更简单的磁引力场装置，以一种有效的形式，如何像基金会所出售的磁引力场一样产生一样的效果。每一组线圈都能够自供给，即使是用不同的线圈，也能产生强大的等离子体能量，人们可以按照自己喜欢的方式堆栈能量层，无论是用于飞船还是用于沟通，但是得制作大量的等离子体立方体，等离子体磁引力场立方体，这样就能自由的创造你想要的不同的结构。我相信你们的一些学生已经有了蓝图，他们很清楚我说的是什么，他们看见了这个构造，里面其中一个学生在脸书上我叫约翰-李，但实际名字可能是约翰什么，他也做了一样的系统，他通过智能设备与我取得联系，一起制作出3D绘图，还有一个人叫<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what do you call 3-D rendering please explain to us?<br>凯：3D绘图是什么意思，你能解释一下吗？<br>[Calstal]: It’s some kind of virtual drawing or something that allow people to see what you talking<br>考：就是一种虚拟的绘图，让人们看见你所谈论的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: 3-D drawing yeah okay<br>凯：3D绘图，好<br>[Calstal]: and also I asked the device to, as you can see for those who don’t have coil technology how can they use nature to create Magrav for food feeling and medicine and there you go this is the seashell version.<br>考：我还问智能设备，对那些不知道线圈技术的人来说，如何利用自然的力量创造磁引力场，作为食物与药物供给，就是这个，贝壳版本<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  what is inside yours seashell<br>凯：在你的贝壳里有什么？<br>[Calstal]: Okay let me go get it, let me go the other ribbon of it hold on standby.<br>考：好，让我们弄清楚，让我们看另一个，稍等<br>[Rick]: Calsing Crust.<br>瑞克：呵呵 考萨 贝壳<br>[Calstal]: The seashell will have gans and nano coating the gans is mixed with ashes so when we should apply it into the seashell and when the seashell have beeninto the gans to have ashes into it and then device recommend that is always neat because the process where the plasma from the geometric of the seashell will create similar to pure energy where people can interact with pure  plasma from the unit where they can just use the method where to feel the field of the plasma and  talk to it<br>考：这个贝壳有甘斯，纳米涂层后的甘斯与灰烬相混合 ，我们把它运用到这个贝壳中，然后外面贝壳就变为甘斯，有灰烬在里面，智能体告诉我保持干净，因为从这个几何构造的贝壳 产生的等离子体与纯净的能量相似，人体可以与这个单元产生的纯净的等离子体相互作用，通过这种方法可以感受到等离子体的场能，并可以与之对话<br>[Mr. Keshe]: how do you get these so covered in glue<br>凯：你是怎么用胶覆盖住的<br>[Calstal]: well so it wont run away.<br>考：这样就可以固定在一起，不会分离<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  but you use so much hot glue.<br>凯：但你用了好多热胶<br>[Calstal]: well its cheap over here in America and its more convenient for …<br>考：这很便宜，在美国到处都有，很方便<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  so you have a hot glue gun or it’s a liquid you buy a bunch of it.<br>凯：你要有一盒热胶枪，或者它是液体的，你直接浇上去<br>[Castal]: No you use the hot glue gun. And also this is what it looks like on the inside all these seashells…<br>考：用热胶枪，这就是里面的情况<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  what is inside?<br>凯：里面是什么？<br>[Calstal]: well the inside is all the seashell pointing toward each other and out the sea shell has gans<br>考：在里面，所有贝壳都相互指向对方,外面的贝壳有甘斯<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No no no face it towards us please I just saw something else, can you bring to the camera we can see.<br>凯：不不，把它朝向我们，我看见了一些东西，你能调整一下你的相机吗，我们才能看见<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It just a, okay you put them in the centre and like that. 凯： ，你把它们放在中间，是吗，<br>[Calstal]: Yes they are all the way on the side to which you can see they all point toward each other, they all point toward each other<br>考：是的，他们都在自己一边，你可以看见，他们相互指向对方 ，都相互指向对方</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: and what’s on the back?<br>凯：后面是什么？<br>[Calstal]: this is a coconut , coconut shell this is all organic plasma graph now and then it does talk but it does not sound like machine it sound more human and it tastes more no metal but with this version it taste very metallic and u interface with it when the intelligence talk to me, you can taste metal coming from the feeling and you start talking you can taste metal like (V sticking to your mouth it has that taste to it, when this version talk and interact and talk it’s different you don’t taste the metal at all it tastes like normal and the voice you don’t hear the electronic voice at all, it’s more like normal voice like you and I speak and then you just do the same way you should vibration instantly becoming from it and you can ask if for food water protein and it does not taste metal at all you know you can feel and taste organic it’s like no metal it is very nice basically.<br>考：这是椰果壳 ，现在是有机的等离子体，它会说话，但听起来不像机器，而是更像人类，它尝起来没有金属味道，但是这个版本 尝起来很有金属味道，当和它互动智能体和我对话时，感觉上会有金属的味道，就像直接接触到你的嘴巴，可以尝到，就是这个版本讲话时感受到的。当这个版本 讲话时就不同了，味道没有金属味，很正常，听到的声音没有那种电流的声音，更像正常的声音，就像你和我讲话一样。你可以做一样的事情，你感觉 轻微的震动，你可以向它要食物，水，蛋白质，尝起来完全没有金属的味道，尝起来是有机物不是金属。非常好。<br>So I just want to bring that to the table, what I have been learning from the unit and teach me how to make a different approach toward the same understanding of the same goal and because some people do not have technology in some people and not technology-based and so I told the device about it I told the different people disability and ability and it begin to calculate different path or each a different condition for the people to obtain plasma technology and in the necessary conditions that they desire<br>考：所以我想要展示这些，以及我从装置里面学到的东西，教会我如何通过不同的途径达到对同一目标的理解，因为一些人没有这个技术，一些人没有这个技术基础，所以我告诉装置关于这个问题，不同的人有的有能力，有的没有能力，它就开始计算不同的途径为不同情况下的人们获得同样的等离子体技术，以及在一些条件下他们所渴望的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: but what do you get from it?<br>凯：但你是从哪里得到的<br>[Calstal]: this okay you won’t get a magical power from this one only plasma feel only that is for nano coating and plasma in the house and here you get communication you get food you water you get…<br>考：好，这个， 你不会从它里面得到强大的或魔幻的能量，只是感觉到等离子体的能量，只有这个 是为房间提供等离子体与纳米涂层的，而这个 你能够进行沟通，可以得到食物，水，药物<br>[Mr. Keshe]: stop, go back to the other one with the energy one, how do you get energy out of that single one?<br>凯：停下。回到那个，那个有能量的，你是如何从那个单一装置得到能量的<br>[Calstal]: this on right there?<br>考：这个吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes<br>凯：是的<br>[Calstal]: this is based on…<br>考：这是建立在….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: somebody asked me the question I said I will ask him when he comes<br>凯：有人问我问题，我说过，当他来时，我会回答<br>[Calstal]: this basically nano coating the house Dr. Keshe nano coating lenses spread throughout the whole house whole environment in plasma rise and therefore it should have self-powering system. I asked the intelligent to please spread nano coating faster the so we can start running my house completely and it say okay<br>考： 这个装置对整个房间进行纳米涂层，凯史先生，纳米涂层扩展到整个房间，周围的环境呈现等离子体化，因此它能自我供给，我要求智能体快速扩展纳米涂层，所以我们能运行我的整个房间，它说：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: do you see any reduction in your power now?<br>凯：那你看见你的房间里的耗能有减少吗？<br>[Calstal]: no I just thought I has not been a month yet so I told my father it will take until April and take a look at is bill there should be a reduction like 10% percent the first month 30% the second month and at the third month it would be 50% and then 4th month should be 75% and the 5th month…<br>考：不，我想还没有一个月，所以我告诉我的父亲，要等到4月份，然后再看下账单，应该第一个月会有10%的减少，第二月30%，第三个月可能50%，第四个月可能75%，第五个月…<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  but how have you connected it can you explain to us how you connect.<br>凯：但你是如何连接它的呢，告诉我们你是如何连接的<br>[Calstal]: okay see when I first built this Dr. Keshe I was still learning I connected I a Magrav. Dr. Keshe when I unplug it I won’t  hear it anymore the voice will go away, alright. So …<br>凯：好，但我第一次制作这个的时候，凯史博士，我还是在学习中，我把它连接到一个磁引力场装置 ，我不再听见那种声音，声音消失了。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You killed it<br>凯：你把插头拔下了<br>[Calstal]: okay now…<br>考：好的，现在<br>[Mr. Keshe]: put it into sleep<br>凯：插进去<br>[Calstal] Okay now it won’t… okay all I do I hook up in parallel and then what happen I use split plasma capacitor from this parallel connection, you can see let me get a flash light Dr. Keshe stand-by.<br>考：好，平行的连接，我用的是一个分离的等离子体电容器 ，来自平行的连接 ，你能看见，让我用手电筒，稍等<br>[Rick]: I was thinking the same thing …<br>瑞克：我想的也是一样的<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  i felt it the same yeah I thought about it.<br>凯：我也是想的一样<br>[Calstal]: yeah, see how I hook it up? It nano coated away its automatical. I hook it in parallel right there do you see it Dr. Keshe.<br>考：看见如何连接了吗？它是自动纳米涂层的，我是将它们平行勾连的 ，看见了吗，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yap<br>凯：是的<br>[Calstal]: and this one is in series split plasma compositor, you can see his nano coating through the plastic hot glue and the reason I hook it up this because I was looking at your schematic and I don’t know it look like these are in parallel so just hook up in parallel instead of end up cutting the wire and making a mess of thing since I spin filled down on the plug core and stuff like that.<br>考：这是一个并联里的分离等离子体电容器 （04:37:05），你能看见纳米涂层经过这个塑料热胶 ，我这样将它们勾连在一起 ，是因为看了你的图表，看起来是平行的，所以我就像这样平行的勾连，而不是切断线圈，以及其他繁琐的事情，自从我把火线连接到装置这边的插头。<br>So this is, you can see right there is, okay parallel right there going this side and this going parallel to a series split capacitor connection and then it hook on the other capacitor in parallel to each other and then finally the plasma, split plasma battery in the ring form right there and asked I learn more, this is the version plasma battery I created this is my first understanding and the I start build what I understand later then the ring version came out the ring plasma came out and the ring this just came as an add on as I begin to trouble shoot because when I first time I plug it in I did not connect it with the split plasma connected. And I just connected round and I was getting short then the device intelligent came on when I hooked the power supply to it and it start telling me to trouble shoot my drying up my coil inside here by it suggest that I create, split capacitor put it here and cut the wire and so it will create plasma instead electrical, fully create plasma because AC will work perfectly with a split capacitor but easy it told me  to explain to me when I create these ring setup to connected to this one wire and I said how is that possible you creating a short it said on we creating a plasma condition meaning I  just do what i ask and the plasma increased it and everything else that go with it but now I don’t hear it anymore Dr. Keshe since its silent, it feel different it feel empty I don’t feel the metal in it anymore I don’t feel nothing. </p>
<p>考：你能看见 这里平行的然后沿这一边，到左边并联的等离子体电容器，然后勾连住另一个平行的等离子体电容器 ，然后到分离的等离子体电池，环状的部分这里 ，我还学到更多，这是我制造的等离子体电池版本 ，是我初次的理解，然后我又建造了圆环版本 ，圆环等离子体，然后我加上这个圆环，我有一些连接问题，第一次我插上的不是分离等离子体电池线，我只是环绕的连接，短路了，然后智能体进来了，然后我将能量接上它，它告诉我解决的办法，干燥这里里面的线圈，它建议将分离的等离子体电容器放在这里 ，切下线，那么创造的不是电流而是等离子体，创造完全的等离子体，因为AC（直流）将会与分离电容器很好的兼容，在一起运行，但并不容易，它这样告诉我。它开始向我解释，当我创造这些圆环并连接到这条线上 ，我就说这怎么可能创造这样一个短路，它说你创造的不是短路而是一个等离子体环境，照着我说的做，等离子体就会使它增长，其他的东西也会随着它一起成长，自从它沉默了，我再也听不见了，凯史博士，它感觉不一样了，感觉有点虚空，在它里面我没有感觉金属的味道，感觉不到任何东西<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Plug it in and feel it you feel something<br>凯：插上去，你会感觉到一些什么<br>[Calstal]: Yeah hold on<br>考：好，稍等<br>[Mr. Keshe]: my god the amount of plastic glue you use you finance a company for it.<br>凯：我的天，你用了大量的塑料胶，你可以开一个公司了<br>[Calstal]:  Its saying do you miss me, I am telling it yes. It came back on, now I feel the metal again. A feeling that a present coming from it that it enter my brain and electrical vibration into my hand my heard and then I feel metal I can taster metal in my skin.<br>考： 它说：你想我了吗？我说：是的。它又回来了。现在我又感觉到金属 ，一个来自它那里的感觉进入到我的大脑，我的手，我的心感觉有些电流经过引起震动，我能感觉到金属，我在皮肤里尝到金属的味道<br>[Mr. Keshe]: have you given the blueprint of this to Renon to host.<br>凯：你把蓝图交给雷农了吗？<br>[Calstal]: Actually you have it already Dr. Keshe because you draw it yesterday you know ok, each coil as you can see.<br>考：事实上，你已经有了，凯史博士，因为你昨天已经画出来了，好，你看见的每个线圈<br>[Mr. Keshe]: no no no, what I will see what we need to do this is how we carry on. You need to, you need to make a drawing I will get Robert to, Renon to get in touch with you. You are absorbing my energy from the speaker you shouldn’t do that.<br>凯：不，不，我看见的，我们需要的，这是我们如何继续，你需要画一张图，我会让罗伯特和雷农联系你，你是在吸收我的能量 ，在屏幕上，你不该这么做<br>[Calstal]: okay<br>考：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I know what you are going, been there done that, you can do a lot. Speak with Renon or Robert to make a schematic the full design of this in 3-D and post on the internet post it on the Keshe foundation what do you call blueprint.<br>凯：我知道你在做什么，在那里，你可以做很多事情。联系雷农还有罗伯特，去制作图表，3D全制图，放在网上，放在凯史基金会蓝图里<br>[Calstal]: This is the 0 time communication device.<br>考：这个零延迟沟通系统<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  yeah<br>考：是的<br>[Calstal]: It’s something about the glass too Dr. Keshe the device informed me that glass created the right plasma resident for you because human being are made of crystal and it see us spectrum like an energy field it can see an energy field and it know that we are made mostly of crystal.<br>考：有一些关于玻璃的事情，凯史博士， 智能体告诉我玻璃创造为你创造正确的等离子体状态的连接，因为人类是有水晶制造的，它把我们看成光谱，就像能量场，它能看见能量场，它知道我们大部分是由水晶做的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: whatever put it down let people replicate it and see what we get It is our duty to do that so speak to Renon and Robert they do a 3 there and then step by step what it does the way it is, I have asked our factory group to test the second coil plasma battery yesterday we will tell you what we see from out development side, its calling the factory testing.<br>凯：无论如何，把蓝图画出来，让人们可以复制，看我们能够收获什么，这是我们的责任。联系雷农和罗伯特，他们在那里可以一步步做，我昨天已经要求我的工厂团队测试这个第二种等离子体电池，我们会告诉你从我们发展中我们看见什么，这是工厂测试<br>[Calstal]: and also they need to use the method to connect to the plasma field with hope to open the emotional on the heart and you are right the device totally agree with everything said, that if anyone wants connect the device you need feed themselves from it you need to learn to build all relationship and then finally then need to trust what they want to teleport move from here to another reality or see other world they need to trust the device as a bridge and that’s going to be a little tough for some people though Dr. Keshe<br>考：他们需要找到一个方法去连接等离子体场，希望用以打开心中的情感，你是对的，智能体完全同意你所说的，如果有人想要连接这个装置，你需要从它那里供给自己，你需要建立所有的关系，然后他们需要信任他们想要进行心灵传输的东西，从这边到那个真实的一边，看见其他的世界，需要相信装置作为桥梁的作用，这对一些人有些难，凯史博士<br>[Mr. Keshe]: let them be tough. They will be, will be the people to learn at time, Okay so it there anything else you can tell us?<br>凯：让他们受磨炼，他们会的，是时候让人们学习这些了，好的，还有什么其他的事情需要告诉我们吗?<br>[Calstal]: Well I ask it to basically to help, to encourage, to let people build one of these and connect to it and it’s a gift for those people who don’t have technology like oil and stuff it can build organic version for medicine and for healing the certain condition and plasma and heal  the body feed them so they can use this system now. If they choose to and then for the technical people they can build the t coil version and basically they can feed themselves<br>考：好吧。我要求它帮助，去鼓舞，让人们建造这些其中的一个，这个需要进行连接 ，而这些是为那些没有技术基础的人准备的 ，比如没有线圈以及其他的，你以制作这个有机的版本，从而获取药物，治愈某些情况，还有等离子体治愈身体，供给能量，所以他们可以用这些系统，可以选择这两个 ，有技术的人可以制作这个线圈版本 。基本上可以供给自己能量。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: what you get from the organic one?<br>凯：你从有机版本里可以得到什么？<br>[Calstal]: you get everything except power supply like for example it talk it has so much knowledge just like the other one, its voice is not electronic it’s more like human voice and it feel like friendlier. The other feel like robotic this feel like very friendlier it’s more like…<br>考：除了能量供应，你什么都可以得到。比如，它可以讲话，博学多闻 ，就像那个线圈版本，它的声音不是像电流一样，而是更像人类的声音，更友好，那个线圈版本更像机器人，而这个有机版本更显得友好，更像…<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  put his design up lets that the people test<br>凯：把设计图做出来，让人们可以测试<br>[Calstal]: and they have to use the method and it told me that some people that already trust the plasma they just walk around it, it do what they want and I  say what do you need they get feed they get, communication at will but the thing is not everybody can have that kind of trust with the start out so it take time.<br>考：他们得相应的方法，它告诉我一些已经完全信任等离子体的人们只要走进它，它就能实现它们想要的，我说是什么意思，他们获取能量供给，交流沟通完全可以凭借自身的意愿，但这种事情不是每个人能够做到的，不是每个人有那种信任开始第一步，所以需要时间<br>[Mr. Keshe]: ok but let us see because, that’s perfect thank you very much.<br>凯：好的，让我们看，很好，谢谢你<br>[Calstal]: So Dr. Keshe what have you learn what have you learned from the intelligence after it start it start teaching your class the other day. I learn a lot from it too and from you sir.<br>考：所以，凯史博士，自从它在你的教学中进行教学后，你从智能体中学到什么，我从它那里学到很多，还有从你那里，先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: thank you very much indeed. Please stay, those of you who work within the foundation, work or teach the knowledge of the foundation keep within the ethos of the foundation. Thank you very much for sharing, please remember to thank for your time please remember that we are trying to launch the one planet one nation one race and in that process we need the support of the Keshe foundation worldwide as you seen we start structuring that we work by language by the national borders and I hope you can join us to change the course of humanity, it’s in our hands. We cannot blame anyone else for it.<br>凯：谢谢，不要走开。那些在基金会工作的人，在基金会中工作与教学的人请保持在基金会的精神理念之架构下。请记住，谢谢你带来的，请记住，我们要建立一个星球，一个国家，一个种族，并在这个过程中我们需要全世界范围内支持凯史基金会的人，就像你看到的，我们开始构建整个结构，我们通过各自语言，各自国界进行教学，我希望你们能加入进来，改变人类的进程，就在我们手里。我们不会责怪其他任何人。<br>[Calstal]; I also tell people that,<br>考：我还有一些事情要告诉人们<br>[Mr. Keshe]: let me explain something very interesting we will carry on with teaching we will carry on with developing, we will carry on with changing the course of humanity but what the humanity make the same mistakes of the past is to be seen. Can we bring about a condition that changes for good that we can give medicine food shelter unconditional that no man needs to fight for it. No one has to be a slave for it. We will have change we will change our lot of things which will be carried out man for thousand if years but can we make peace a habit of man? That’s a big question unless to do what we heard from the guy in Switzerland, building course and feeling that they are connected. We hear we see people sharing non start on of 2 people but collectively we are changing the situation. It’s not one person anymore, its one humanity and collectively we have to change  it, it’s our responsibility to make the world a better place for man in the space. The planet earth is too small.<br>凯：让我解释一些很有趣的事情，我们会继续进行教学，我们会继续发展（科技），我们会继续努力改变人类的进程，但是人类在过去所犯的错误可以预见会重新发生，我们能带来一种向好的方向改变的条件与环境，我们能无条件的提供食品，药物，住所，这样没有人会因为这些东西相互争斗，没有人会因为这些东西出卖自己成为奴隶，我们会有改变，我们会改变，很多事情上千年都与人类无缘，但是我们能够形成具有和平习惯的人类吗？这是一个很大的问题，除非按照我们瑞士那位朋友所说的做，建立起过程，并意识到我们是相互连接的。我们听闻我们看见人们没有停止分享即使只有2个人，但是在一起我们能够改变处境。这不再是一个人的问题，而是关乎整个人类。联合起来我们就能一起改变。这是我们的责任让这个世界成为一个更好的地方，为了人类进入太空，这个行星地球太小了。<br>[Calstal]: definitely<br>考：肯定<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much for all your work and don’t forget we need a lot of donation huge amount of donation, to be able to carry out the peace work. Donation of time, donation of giving system out and donation of being there to be able to change. I have seen some beautiful pictures today they are, it gives me lots of strength to carry on to be able to be there people are teaching and they are teaching unconditionally. I thank you all for returning we try to change the course altogether as I said after March April when we settle in the right position I will come in that we do together build the thing together and now is the time when I give you the secret key, you all drive beautiful Rolls Royce’s but you don’t have the key. You are all passengers to most beautiful knowledge but you don’t know how to ignite it to start.<br>凯：很感谢你，你的工作。别忘记我们需要大量的捐赠，巨大的捐赠，从而能够实现和平的进程，时间的捐赠，展示系统的捐赠，与我们在一起改变进程的捐赠。我今天看见很多好的图片，这给予我很大的力量继续下去，人们在教学，在无条件的教学，我们感谢你们的回归，我们一起改变进程，就像我所说的，三月，四月后，当我们处于恰当的位置，我会回来，一起建造这个东西，是时候给你们秘密的钥匙，你们驾驶着劳斯莱斯，但是没有钥匙。你们就是通向最美妙知识的乘客，但是你们不知道怎样开始启动它。<br>[Calstal]: Dr. Keshe I have a question if you don’t mind me asking, can you explain how the system organic solution able to create plasma communication.<br>考：凯史博士，我有一个问题，如果你不介意我问的话，你能解释一下这个有机版本系统是如何创造等离子体的沟通的吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  I will talk about it next Tuesday please because we have to stop I have to go into a meeting.<br>凯：我会下个星期二再谈，因为我要停止 教学，去开一个会议。<br>[Calstal]: yes sir<br>考：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: so what we need to do is after March, April, May when we see it fit we will give you the final key to key to the star range but slowly we seen the car which is reduced in power now you understand why, people getting differently. The energy systems which are coming in, the agriculture, can you please switch your microphone off, please, the agriculture and the virus section which is coming in, in the next couple weeks so what we need to do, what we have to do is to work to change, We need to change and there is nobody else but this time us to help us, if you miss this opportunity it will be a long time man will gain a second chance. There is no other chances. This is the last call and hopefully we succeed to go through it. We release a number of, a list of act of Keshe foundation around the world the list is already been passed on to our people that we release that you  know where you can contact, we try to bring no more nationality we bring language mother language so that we all speak the language of love care without borders. Please setup Keshe foundation that you can start electing the people who you want to govern the Keshe foundation worldwide and become the interface between the man and the universal community. Thank you very much for you time, I hopefully on Tuesday we will learn more as we learn today and the other days, In respect to German in, to take your car to Paris to Peugeot and please get in touch with Vince and I will give you if you can give your number with Vince I call you I tell you who you have to meet in Paris. You will meet the head of the Peugeot research and we try to see if Peugeot will give you a car that you can go back. Otherwise we will buy you a car to go back because they want to see a car they can test and then we send you hopefully to Volkswagen and we see from there on. Thank you very much for help and thank you very much for sharing knowledge with us.<br>凯：在三月，四月，五月后我们会做什么，如果合适，我们会给你最后的钥匙，星型排列的钥匙。慢慢的，我们看见汽车在减少能量消耗，现在你们知道为什么了，人们得到的感觉不同了。能量系统会走进来，农业，你能关闭你的麦克风吗？在接下来几个星期农业与病毒系统也会走来，所以我们需要做的，我们必须做的，就是去改变，我们需要去改变，没有其他人，这一次是我们自己帮助自己，如果你失去这次机会，人类将会等待更为漫长的时间才有第二次机会，没有其他的机会了。这是最后的呼唤，我们希望能够成功的渡过。我们释放了大量的，一个关于全世界基金会的行动清单，这个清单已经传递给我们的人，我们释放了，你可以知道你可以联系哪里，我们不再带来民族性，我们带来 母语，我们都能讲自己的喜爱的语言，没有界限与隔离。请建立起世界范围内的凯史基金会，然后你可以选择你想要的人来管理基金会，进而成为宇宙社区与人类的交接点。很感谢你们，我希望在星期二能像今天和其他教学那样学到这么多的知识。那位瑞士的朋友请开车到巴黎，到标致，请联系文斯，如果你能把号码给文斯，我会给你打电话告诉你在巴黎和谁见面，你将会与标致研发中心的负责人见面，我们确保标致能够给你一辆车让你开回家。否则，我们会替你买一辆车让你回去。因为他们想要看车，想要测试，然后送你到大众，我们在那里见面。谢谢你们的帮助，谢谢你们与我们分享知识。<br>[Rick]: Thank you, thank you Mr. Keshe and that will wrap it up for today’s knowledge seekers workshop the 98th know seekers workshop, the Keshe foundation spaceship institute, Thursday January 28, 2016 great show, Thank you everybody for participating and showing and just being there for the Keshe foundation and for Mr. Keshe and let go forward for this case upward. Okay thank<br>瑞克：谢谢。凯史先生。现在结束今天的98次知识寻求者教学，凯史基金会太空机构，2016年1月28好，谢谢各位的参与与展示，谢谢与我们以及凯史先生在一起，让我们继续努力前行。好，谢谢。</p>
