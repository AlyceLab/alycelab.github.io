<p>[Rick]: welcome everyone to 97 Keshe Knowledge seekers workshop for Thursday, January 21, 2016 and as usual were here with Mr. Keshe in the Keshe foundation spaceship institute in Italy I am not there with him but we are there in spirit with him and we will hear about today’s teaching we have a number of different presentation and so on to have a look at and I think we’re ready to begin here. Mr. Keshe sure you there?<br>瑞：欢迎来到97次凯史知识探索者教学，今天是2016年1月21日。像往常一样我们和凯史先生一起，在意大利的凯史基金会太空学院为大家授课。我现在没有和他在一起，但是灵魂与他同在，今天的教学会有大量的不同的展示，我认为我们准备好了。凯史先生，您在那里吗？</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: yes. Good morning,  good day to you ,whenever and wherever you listen to these public workshops and we welcome you back to another teaching or knowledge seeking for space technology in the past few days that has been some developments in different aspects of technology which I think as is part of our work and is part of where we see the major changes will come on what we call planetary section it will be through African nations and African continent with one of the greatest pleasure we received some pictures from Benjamin who is working in Ghana to develop and  introduced the technology into the nation of Ghana as part of the Ghanaian space institute he has achieved some breaking results which has attracted the people who work with that to make energy of the Ghana and within the structure of the Ghanaian University and the health and water authorities to look into what is doing and as part of the corporation and collaboration we have  and is been for going on for four months he has extended the work and he has forwarded some pictures to us where he has, is Benjamin online that he can talk to us if he got a clear line from Ghana? Rick do you see him in the background? Hello?<br>凯：是的，早上好，无论何时何地你收听这个公开的教学，我们欢迎你回到另一个教学或知识寻求中即太空技术中，在过去的几天中，在这个技术的不同方面已经有一些明显的进展，这些进展我认为是我们工作的一部分，也是即将到来的行星进程所引起的巨大改变的一部分，这些变化也会通过非洲国家与非洲大陆来实现，其中我们感到很欣慰的是收到了正在戛纳工作的本杰明发来的图片，他发展并介绍这项技术给戛纳人民，以此作为戛纳太空计划的一部分，他取得了一些突破性的成果，这些成果吸引戛纳人工作在他的周围，为戛纳创造更多的能量，戛纳大学和戛纳健康部门以及水利部门已联合在一起展开对这方面的研究，我们与他们在这种联合架构下的合作已经展开了四个月，本杰明扩展了他的工作，寄给了我们一些图片，本杰明在线吗？如果他在戛纳有一条畅通的通话线路，他能和我们对话，瑞克，他在后台吗？<br>[Vince]: no I do not see him<br>文斯：我没看见他。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You do not see him in the background. would you like to show the pictures and then I will explain what is done they have been to the waters of around Ghana the capital city is highly polluted so they have taken waters from the rivers and by applying different aspects of the technology within one hour or so  the waters have cleared and they have done the test trails on them and them and this has brought a lot of attention to them you can see some of the test tubes they have used which shows literally what we saw with the Spanish results some months ago is in line but the difference this time is that the we have asked the authorities in Ghana laboratory the University to test the residue and water, the water was drinkable clean and can be consumed this is part of the same process as we saw last week from our innovation centre where they showed us how they use the nano coated copper for in a way changing acidic to Alkaline there is a lot of work will go on this side we will introduce new systems which are which will come  into  operation.<br>凯：哦，不在。你能给我们展示一些图片吗，然后我再来解释这里面的原理，他们去环绕戛纳首都的河流那里，这条河流被严重污染，于是他们从河中取出样本水，运用这项技术的不同功能，一个小时水就清澈了，他们展示了整个测试过程，这引起了大量的关注，你能看到他们所用的一些试管，这些与几个月前西班牙教学中的结果是一致的。但这次的不同之处是：我们要求戛纳大学实验室的权威人士检测里面的沉淀与水质，发现水是可饮用的，干净的，可消费的。这是我们上周在创新中心所看到的同样过程的一部分，在创新中心他们给我们展示怎样使用纳米涂层铜通过某种方式将酸性水转换为碱性水，这里面仍有许多工作需要做，我们将介绍新的能投入运行的系统。<br>This is the picture when they took the waters from the rivers and when it was applied will you like to go the next picture you have the hang of it I have no access to it, we can carry on what they have seen and what they have reached is as we see residue at the bottom of the, these are the water bottles from the Ghanaian river, the lady on the left hand side, that’s Benjamin, if you go back the lady beside that is Doctor Nana she is the top of the she is the top of the Ghanaian spaceship institute we met with her when she came to the pro-meeting and she is the lady who this year’s united nation year was called on her request and she is extremely powerful lady in the international scene and she is a backer of the Keshe foundation with the team in Ghana in that the energy authorities. These are the water which are brought in from two rivers and they have seen results Benjieming is been explaining is showing the outcome and this is part of the collaboration Ghanaian energy and atomic authorities, we  respond  the government according to what we see in aspects to the energy application and demands of the nation in the coming time. Today as we speak, Alex is on his way to Nigeria, and they meet up, you see the clean water which is been taken after the processing. The Alex is will come back will go back to Nigeria and Alex and Benjamin will meet up and sort out the problem with the energy supply in Ghana and in Nigeria and the remaining west Africa.<br>凯：这是他们从河流中取出的样本水 ，当它被应用在….看下一张图片吧，你知道怎么弄，我弄不了。我们能继续看他们所看见的，他们所达到的，我们看见在瓶底的沉淀物；左边的这位女士，那个是本杰明，左边的这位女士是娜娜医生 ，她是戛纳太空飞船机构的负责人，她在前次会议中我们与她见过面，“联合国年”就是在她的倡议下提出来的，她在国际场合中是很有影响力的人物，她也是戛纳能源机构权威者中支持凯史基金会团队的人。这是从两条河流中取出来的水 （左边变清澈了），并且他们看到了结果，本杰明正在解释所产生的结果，这是与戛纳原子能源机构合作的一部分，在接下来时间里，我们会根据我们所看到的政府在能源方面的需求提供我们的帮助。今天正如我所说，阿历克斯在去尼日利亚的路上，会与本杰明相见，你看见的是经过处理后边清澈的水 ，阿历克斯会回来，返回到尼日利亚，阿历克斯与本杰明会相见以解决戛纳和尼日利亚以及西非其他地区的能源供应问题。<br>We invest a lot of energy and effort and finance into Africa till we see the results the change in culture and the process in the nation. At this moment we have something like 10-12 teachers online on the pay roll of the Keshe foundation and they are teaching freely across Africa how to do these things, how to clean up water how to create energy and teaching people city by city. The  payments which you made as  donation to the Keshe foundation on the back of the power cell unit  is paying for these things you’re investing the money back into teaching giving and changing the condition as we promised be. We pay according to international laws of the Keshe foundation not any other laws equal to all people across the planet so we which not only we bring teachers in we change the life of the people that we all behave and live the same ethos. At this moment we have 9,10 people in Ghana it will be increased to some 300 in the coming year we budgeted for it the sorry Nigeria and three centres and the 4th  centre a teaching centre and development centre will be set up by Alex while he  is there in this trip. We see the same thing for Ghana as I said, we are establishing line with Africa in a very heavy way, I have worked in Africa for long enough to have respect for the continent to understand what we done wrong to them and in a way we are not putting it right we just bring them equal to the rest that this time when we start going to the space technology we all from him same him shape we are all the same. We will invest heavily in Africa this is part of our job if you want to donate to the foundation you know where is going now you see the result. We look for heavy donations we need to escalate our work to about 1 billion this year this as a target I put budget on and I usually don’t fail in my budget. It will take time we will go into the back end will invest in South America the same.<br>凯：我们在非洲投入了大量的精力，工作和财力，直到我们能看到结果即文化的改变以及国家进程上变化。我们现在在网上有10到12名付薪资的教师，他们正免费的给整个非洲大陆教学——怎么做这些事情，怎么净化水，怎么创造能量，逐个城市逐个城市的教学。你们买装置时捐赠的钱就用在这些事情上，你们把钱返回到教学过程中，正如我们承诺的改变目前的状况。我们支付是根据凯史基金会的国际法律而不是其他法律，平等对待这颗行星上所有的人，所以我们不仅带来老师，我们还改变人的生活，我们运作和生活在同一精神下。目前我们在戛纳有9到10人，这在未来一年会上升到300人，我们会为此做好预算，对不起，是尼日利亚，三个中心，第四个中心，教学中心与发展中心将会在阿历克斯逗留期间被他所创建。我们在戛纳会看见同样的事情，正如我所说，我们正与非洲建立一种非常紧密的联系，我在非洲工作了很长一段时间，对这个大陆充满敬意，理解我们对他们做错了什么，某种程度上我们没有使之走向正确的方向，我们只是把他们与世界其他地方平等看待，这次我们开始走向太空科技，我们都从他（指创无者或上帝）那里来，与他一样的形象，我们都是一样的。我们会继续加重对非洲的投入，这是我们工作的一部分，如果你想要捐款给基金会，现在你看到这些钱去哪里了，你看到了结果。我们寻求大额金钱的捐赠，我们需要逐步升级我们的工作，达到10亿，这是今年的目标，我控制好预算，我通常在预算上不会发生问题。这需要时间，我们会去地球那边，在南美洲进行同样的投资。<br> I have already authorized ways to commit Chinese group. We invest 100 million in China for development and technology and we do the same in India. Keshe foundation will be equal we will enter into the world of the political Keshe foundation by mid-July in that frame of time. We will enter on one base one nation one planet one race no arms no guns. As I said when you’re one nation you don’t need army so we invite the nations the governments who heavily invest in arms to rethink their position. We will enter in the politics of the nation through peace application of the technology which means when everybody has everything what is new need for arms why should we invest in to arms where in fact there is the no need. The politics of peace is very cheap the politics of war is very expensive. We enter through the heart of people through their action. We put people in the position that they can show why the change by the way we develop and we share. We don’t enter by conflict.<br>凯：我已授权给中国团队，我投资了1亿在中国发展凯史科技，我们在印度也做了同样的事。凯史基金会将以平等的身份在7月中旬进入世界的政治舞台，我们的政治基础是一个国家，一个星球，一个种族，没有军队，没有枪支。正如我所说的，当你们成为一个国家时就不需要军队了，所以我们邀请正加大投入在军事方面的国家和政府重新定位他们自己的角色。我们通过和平的运用这种科技进入到国家的政治生活中，这意味着当每个人都能拥有所有东西时，对军队还有什么需求，为什么我们要投资到军队中，事实上，不需要军队了。和平性质的政治是成本很低的，战争性的政治是十分昂贵的。我们通过遵循人们的意愿，通过他们自身的行动进入（政治中），我们人们置于这样一个位置：他们能够通过我们发展和分享的科技展示变化的原因。我们不会带着冲突进入政治中。<br> In the coming days we will release more information about collaboration with governments. We have literally are entering in direct negotiations, directly with governments on the one-to-one basis, we have made one request to one nation we do not accept one of the candidates which is been put for presidential election on the basis of the war tools. This is how we are interacting we negotiate if Keshe foundation technology tools are accepted if our blueprints are expected to bring a nation out so has to be our peace. The way we did with the USB stick. We use the bargaining chip of peace with new technology. The investment in Italy has risen to more than 1 million this month we carry on investing we carry on investing heavily in Italy because Italy will bear the flag of the Europe.<br>凯：在接下来几天，我们会释放出我们与政府合作的信息。我们事实上已经进入到更为直接的谈判中，更直接的与政府在一对一的基础上交谈。我们已经发出了自己的要求：在一国之中，我们不接受任何一个竞选作为战争工具的总统职位的候选人 ，这就是我们如何互动与协商的，如果凯史科技被接受，如果释放的蓝图能形成一个我们所期望的带来和平的国家，就像我们释放U盘的方式一样。我们通过新科技来进行和平的谈判，这个月在意大利的投资将会超过100万，我们继续加重在意大利的投资，因为意大利起到欧洲先锋旗帜的作用。<br>We do the same in Africa we do the same in other continents. Keshe foundation has to stand for what it stands for to serve and not to be served. We do not expect any return on what we are spending in Africa because we need to spend to change the totality, what’s happening in there. We do the same in China, according to one of the top scientists and people who work within the realm of governments we have becoming a huge power force behind the peace movement very silent and this silence will be broken very soon we will come to the front on the international scene because we are now ready for it up to now we were not ready. We bring nations on one line. We will speak as if spoken of one nation, colour, race is irrelevant. You are sharing you knowledge with us every day new technology of the foundation is literally posted all over the internet.<br>在非洲与其他的大陆我们做的也一样。凯史基金会代表着它自身的原则与理念：去服务而不是被服务。我们在非洲的投资不求回报，因为我们需要去改变这个整体，那里正发生的。<br>在中国我们做的也一样。根据一位顶尖科学家以及工作在政府部门的人的说法，我们正在默默的成为那些以和平理念为基础的政府背后的强大政治力量，但这种沉默很快会被打破，我们会来到世界政治舞台的前台，因为我们准备好了，之前没有准备好。我们使所有国家同一化。我们将以一个国家的身份讲话，肤色与种族变得不相干了，你与我们分享你们的知识，实际上，基金会每天的新技术都会被投射到世界各地。<br>People being able to walk rivers being able to clean vegetation to grow much better and faster energy supplies the space programs taking shape. By the end of this year we should achieve what we promised but not we the we is one nation, us as a citizen of this planet. I take more and more back seats to be able to interact with the change of the course and I leave change in you hand. We need people who can stand and as we launch the one nation one place no race the blue color of the Keshe foundation the blue color of the planet will become the sign of peace. No words print the world peace treaty and hand it to people with the color, in voting place the paper of white aside, blue color is the blue color of the planet, the color of peace and the color of the true real people who work for peace.<br>凯：人们能够到处自由的行走了，河流能够变得更加清澈了，蔬菜能够长得更好更快了，能量的供应，以及太空项目使其成真。在今年底，我们应该能实现我们所承诺的：我们是一个国家，都是 这颗行星上的居民。我越来越退居后台以便能够与这个进程中的改变产生互动，我让你们来掌控这个进程，变化在你手。我们需要能够承担这些的人们，当我们号召一个国家，一个星球，一个种族的时候。凯史基金会的蓝色，这颗行星的蓝色将会成为和平的符号。在和平条约上不需要印上语言，把颜色交给人们，在选举中把白纸放在边上，涂上蓝色的颜色这个星球的颜色，和平的颜色，真正为和平而工作的人们的颜色。<br>We change the course and we change it heavily and we have set to change the course as I said I will walk you through the others now I walk you through this. The opposition has no meaning they are trying to close bank accounts everything else we opening more companies more bank accounts around the world. They are trying to attack us in different fronts through 2 flag points in Entrap and Germany the other nations have opened their eyes they are open more doors for the foundation we see systematic growth of the foundation and that what it matters systematic delivery of technology to people, people who cannot  walk and in the coming days we will release the most radical systems ever in used health that people can help themselves to walk away from every known disease. We deliver the power units we deliver the energy units we deliver the water cleaning systems now we deliver the full health system. Renon are you online? Do you see Renon in the background?<br>凯：我们改变了进程，我们有力的改变了它，我们注定要改变这个进程。就像我所说的，我通过其他人走进你，通过这个过程走进你。对抗没有意义，他们设法关闭我们的银行账户以及其他，而我们在世界上开设更多的公司以及更多的银行账户。他们试图在不同的前沿攻击我们，在安特普和德国这两个主要地点，这让其他国家开了眼界，他们为基金会敞开更多的大门，我们看见基金会正在系统性的成长，这就是最重要的，系统性的传递知识给人们，对于不能正常行走的人们，在接下来的日子里，我们会释放更为激进和彻底的在应用医疗上的系统，人们能够使自己从任何已知的疾病中走出来，我们释放了动力单元，能量单元，水净化系统，现在我们释放全部的医疗健康系统。雷农，你在线吗？有人看见雷农在后台吗？<br>[Rick]: donot see him here No I don’t see him in there either<br>瑞克：这边没有看见他，那边也没有。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: He hasn’t joined us yet when you see him can you bring him up. Can we have, pardon.<br>凯：他还没有加入进来。当你看见他时请把他带进来。<br>[Rick]:here is the testimonial about health I am not sure I guess it is associate Frigen<br>瑞：这里有一个测试报告，是关于嗯，健康医疗的，我也不确定，我猜是与….<br> [Mr. Keshe]:Let me while you speak about the health part we are raising a point we have seen this before we explained this in the teaching of about year 2 years ago and now we getting the report people who are using the CO2 are in cancer especially the women. We do not know how the structure how they done it but apparently in Holland one or two ladies who lost the menstruation cycle through menopause they have restarted the cycles<br>凯：我来说一下，当你说到这个健康医疗部分时，我们就提出了一个问题，我们以前看到过，我在2年前的教学中解释过，现在我们得到报告人们正在把CO2甘斯用在癌症上，尤其是妇女，我们不知道这个是怎样的，他们怎样做的，但是很明显在荷兰的一两位进入绝经期的女士有开始有了月经。<br>[Rick]: I can read the testimonials here from one person Libby<br>瑞：我能读一下这儿来自利利比的测试报告。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: could you read it please put it on so it can be read<br>凯：请读一下，再把它放到网站上以便其他人能看到。<br>[Rick]: Sure yeah just a second here<br>瑞：好，等一下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: This we saw when we develop the technologies of the health in Belgium 3, 4 years ago for sometimes we used to warn the people because the energy receipts sodrastic.., can you read it please<br>凯：我们看到的这个是我们3,4年前在比利时发展健康医疗时产生的，我们不时的警告人们，因为这个能量接收是很有戏剧性的，你能读一下吗？<br>[Rick]: okay setting up a live stream just a second here while I get this. Okay this is Keshe foundation testimonial and it from Libby apparently here is a remarkable story from Jackie using the health pad okay here goes I really didn’t want to share this but my friend told the I need to do it for science LOL so here goes this is in regards to pain pad experience directed to women I wear my pain pad all the time it gives me energy pain relief and less hungry. Although that is not what I need it is still keeping me in balance but what I’ve noticed and also a friend with the same experience is having our menstrual cycle one in which both of us has not had for about five years as anyone else this symptom. One thing is interesting is that in my mind I will still prefer to have this compared to hot flashes so maybe it’s giving me what I need LOL so<br>瑞：好，我把它放在直播上，等一下，我正在弄。好了，这是凯史基金会的测试报告，它来自利比，是关于杰伊使用减痛包的令人印象深刻的故事，“好，开始，我并不想把这个分享出来，但我的一个朋友告诉我说我需要这么做，笑话一下（LOL）所谓的科学，所以事情是这样的：这是与妇女相关的使用减痛包的经验，我一直带着我的减痛包，它给我能量，缓减疼痛，减少饥饿感，尽管这并不是我所需的，它仍然让我保持平衡，但我注意到，我的一个朋友也有同样的经验，就是我们都有月经了，而我们已经绝经5年了，就像其他经历这个时期的人一样，我还是倾向于把这个现象解释为潮热，所以它在给我所需的，呵呵…..<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we reported this before and now we see it coming back up let me explain to you something which has brought this about this is the cycle of the peace which brings comes in through the cycle of the existence that the situation is peaceful I can carry on reproducing the cycle of menstruation when it comes to menopause and it stops is and has been on the on the back of the history of mankind as part of our evolution where the is no guarantee for our off springs to live we terminate the preproduction cycle and that how  the women has it that’s why they call it menopause and as we seen the security of the existence and life in the West and in more or less over the world has  increased we have seen the menopause time getting further and further starting from it used to be around 20, 25 some hundreds of years ago now while we are in the age of 50 55 60 65 because guarantee of the surety of the society looking after our off springs through social security services or whatever and better healthcare has guaranteed the survival so women have gone further and further in giving birth now when that peace comes that guarantees the total health that’s what the system does interacts directly with the emotional part of the body of the woman that it assure that psychological everything is okay that we can carry on producing there is no problem they go back into the cycle of the monthly cycle<br>凯：我们以前报告过这个，现在我们看见它又回来了。让我解释一下这是如何引起的。这是和平的循环，这种和平的到来与实现是通过存在实体的循环，即认为我的情境是和平的，我能继续生产，于是启动月经周期；一般当更年期来临时，月经就停止了，这是建立在我们人类过去的历史基础上，作为我们人类进化的一部分，在这部分进化过程中，我们情感上认为没有能力没有资源喂养我们的后代以保证其生存，于是我们停止了再生产循环。这就是妇女们所称作的绝经。我们看见在西方生存与生活的安全稳定，而且或多或少整个世界也渐渐如此，我们看见绝经期越来越延后，几百年前它是从20或25岁开始的，而现在我们是在50,55,60,65开始的，因为通过社会保障系统或良好的医疗系统社会能够承诺并保障我们后代的生存，于是妇女越来越延后生产；现在和平到来，并承诺保证完全的健康，这就是这个系统所做的，即直接与妇女身体的情感部分直接发生互动，它不断进行心理暗示表示一切都好，我们能继续生产，没有任何问题，于是她们有回到了月经。<br>so we will see this coming back this is not the first time we reported this over 10 years. The people who used to come to Keshe foundation in Ninov we used to tell them so many times I told the grandfathers if you don’t want to be a papa you better be careful now that the wife has gone back into the full cycle. The strange thing is they become fully active all the heart’s what you call it or what the call the hot flashes and all the symptoms of menopause seems to disappear they start living a very active life. I have seen women in 70, 75 years old who actually start going out spending more time out they go shopping which they couldn’t do before. We done a test on a couple with this in Belgium and we have seen the change we done test in 80, 90 year old men we seen the change we done the test 7, 8 years ago we have seen the man who was prepared to die was so active sexually as we said they feel like Viagra the system they use. Now you got to understand that this is part of the structure of the work if you have health problems you cannot ignore the technology anymore.<br>凯：我们会看到这种返回现象，这不是第一次，我们已经报道了近10年了，那些经常到位于尼诺的凯史基金会的人，我常告诉他们，我告诉爷爷辈的人说，如果你不想成为爸爸最好小心，因为你的妻子又有了月经。奇特的是她们变得充满活力，在心脏方面；叫什么，叫所谓的热潮，更年期的症状似乎消失了，她们又开始了充满活力的生活，我看见70,75岁的妇女实际上开始在外面花更多的时间玩乐，她们去购物，以前她们不可能这样做。我们在比利时对几个人做过这样的测试，我们看见了变化，我们在7到8年前做过这样的测试，我们见过一个准备好迎接死亡的人在性生活上变得异常有活力，他们使用这个系统就像在服用伟哥。现在你得明白这是这个运作结构的一部分，如果你有健康方面的额问题，你不能再忽视这个技术了。<br>In the coming time we release systems as we announced on the 11th possibly on the 11th we can change the date without notice but we have earmarked 11th of February for release of total new technology from every disease remember to what we explain two we introduce to you the system is for you to test it’s for the Keshe foundation supporters around the world for the doctors to test build the system cost less than maybe $50 give it to the hospitals out it to the people to be tested give it to the authorities to be tested health care is one of the biggest burden on national assets health care of elderly is one of the biggest problems at the moment in the west and in Japan and other nations. The health units would release is a total system total change of course Renon team is finalizing the last section of it so when we give you the blueprint you can see the system we have developed as the initial system is for you like the power unit to change it to develop it to test it. You can walk in to it, it feeds you if you set it up, you can walk into it, walk out of it after a few times without any cancer you can have Alzheimer’s walking into it walk out it without Alzheimer’s. Every disease will be reversible through this total system total cost peanuts compared to what it brings but understand we are giving you the framework is for you fill in the full book. We do not put any claims we just show you the way the system works because we have tested it we know what it is at the same time in the teaching will show you how you can develop systems for emotional and long problems and systems for repairing like heart valves for intestine changes for anything phsically without intrusion can be done. A true 3 dimensional system will be offered that people can do doctors have no choice but to test. We’ve shown the work with the pain pad we’ve shown the work with the pain pen and now we show the total system a universal health system. Please…<br>凯：在以后的时间里我们会释放系统，我们会在11号宣布，如果改变日期不另行通知，但我们已经将2月11号标记为释放治愈所有疾病的完全新式的技术的日子，记住我们所解释的，我们给你介绍的系统是给你测试的，是为世界各地的凯史基金会的支持者所准备的，是为医生们所准备的，建造这个系统可能少于50美元，把这些系统交给医院，让人们去测试，给那些权威者们，让他们去测试；医疗健康是国家财政的一个巨大负担，老年人的医疗健康目前是西方国家、日本以及其他国家地区的最大的问题之一。将释放的医疗单元是一个完全整体化的系统，完全改变既有的进程。雷农团队正在使它的最后一部分成型。所以当我们给你蓝图，你就能看到我们正在改进的系统，最初的系统就像能量单元一样需要去发展它、改变它、测试它。你能走进它，它来供养你；如果你建造了这个系统，你们走进去，然后走出来，像这样重复几次，癌症都会消失。如果你有老年痴呆症，走进去，再走出来，你的病就好了。任何疾病都能通过这个完整的系统来逆转，整体的花费与这个系统所带来的（效果与结果）相比简直微不足道，但你要知道我们只是给你一个框架，这本书还需要你们继续写下去。我们不作任何断言，我们只是给你展示这个系统是如何运作的，因为我们对它进行了测试，知道它是什么；同时，在教学中，将会给你们展示你们该如何发展这项系统，用于情感和长远的问题，以及这个系统的修复功能，如给心脏瓣膜修复，肠道修复，以及其他肉体上的问题，这些都可以不用动手术来完成。我们将展示这个3维的系统，人们能够自己来测试，医生也将别无选择来进行测试。我们已经展示了这个减痛包的运作过程，展示了减痛笔的运作过程，现在我们将会展示一个完全的通用医疗系统。<br>[Rick]:  Mr.Keshe can I read testimonial on the health pad work just a couple days ago January17, from Golden Aged Gans ,people see this is in <a href="http://testimonials.keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://testimonials.keshefoundation.org</a> ,Lets go , it is from Tony Pearson:   just wanted to share my experience with the Keshe health pads the health side of it I didn’t think was really my thing my mother is in your late 70s has had various health problems over a long period. Arthritic deterioration making her frail and affecting her mobility thyroid problem we share various strokes etc. affects her mind and body more recent was a wound just above her ankle that refused to heal she was hospitalized for a week and a half is a got much worse due to infection. It seemed to stabilize and she was released within a day  it flared up again she was being treated with antibiotics and seemed to be having little effect this was 3 days ago. I felt desperate can I do something? I read through the Keshe health info Renan and crew have put togetherand  came across the nano and gans five health application PDF file I read through it and found a treatment for open wounds and burns uses a  copper oxide tissue sandwiched between 2 CO2 tissues（ physicality and emotion）<br>瑞：凯史先生，我们读一下这个关于医疗包的测试报告吗？是几天前，1月17号的，来自“甘斯的黄金时代”，人们可以在<a href="http://testimonials.keshefoundation.org看到，我们开始，署名是托尼" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://testimonials.keshefoundation.org看到，我们开始，署名是托尼</a> 皮尔森：我想分享一下凯史医疗包的经验，这医疗方面并不与我相关，我们母亲70岁了，有各种健康问题很长时间了，关节炎恶化使她变得脆弱，并影响她的行动能力，甲状腺、各种中风等影响她的身体和精神，最近在她的膝盖上有一个伤口，她拒绝治疗，她已经在医院呆了一个多星期了，由于感染引起的问题变得更加恶化。看起来病情似乎稳定下来了，她出来休息了一天，但病情又爆发了。3年前，她被用抗生素治疗，似乎有一点效果。我感到绝望，我能做些什么呢？我浏览凯史医疗雷农信息中心，把上面信息都浏览了一下，读到5份关于纳米与甘斯的凯史医疗医用的PDF文件，我通读了一遍，发现一种治疗伤口或烧伤的治疗方法，用氧化铜面纸夹在2份CO2面纸之间（肉体与精神）。<br> I left the containers of gans I was going to use on my Magrav unit overnight extracted just the water with the syringe to make the pad took it to her explaining what it was and how it was time for her to take charge of her condition with her intent to heal the wound she was open and left her meditating with it 15 30 minutes at a time a couple times a day and visited her this morning after 36 hours her situation has changed immensely  before I could ask her about it she sprang out to her chair was much better she has no pain and infection is gone more than that she is walking around the straight back moving your neck around more mobility than she has had for a long time just kept saying it’s amazing. She is moving much quicker barely uses her cane she is not about to go dancing is as is a much better shape slightly she says mentally she is  a lot sharper and concentrate better I’m amazed more than I could have hoped for what can I say but with all my heart thank Renon thank you Mr. Keshe to see the look of relief and joy on my mother’s face is worth everything. Okay well that pretty much says it all there. Then we get a lot of reports like this, this is not just one of literally hundreds and hundreds of people that are getting positive results with these pads especially but all the health products<br>我让甘斯容器就这样放置着，整晚我都在使用我的磁引力场装置，我用注射器取出水制成减痛包，拿给我的母亲看告诉她这是什么，告诉她是时候通过自身的意愿占据自己情感的主导权进行自我疗愈了，她很开放，开始使用它治疗自己，15到30分钟一次，一天2到3次，经历过36小时后，今天早上看见她的病情已明显好转；在我跟她说话之前，她从她的椅子上跳了起来，伤口看起来好多了，她不痛了，感染也消失了，她在周围直线来回走动，并更加灵活的活动自己的脖子，她很长时间都没有这样了。她一直在说，太神奇了。她走起路来更快了，几乎不用她的手杖，她不用去跳舞就能保持好的体型。她说精神上的，她变得更灵敏，更容易集中精神。我被震惊了，这远超我的期待。我能说什么，真心谢谢雷农，谢谢凯史先生，让我能够看见母亲脸上舒心与愉悦的表情，这比一切都值得。好了，大致就是这样的。我们得到大量的像这样的报告，这不是唯一，而是上百上千尤其使用减痛包而得到积极效果的其中的一个测试报告。但这些都是都是医疗产品。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: the Keshe foundation health pad and the pen will be marketed next week we have been told on Monday we will receive the health authorities he sent me certification for it to be launched, we launch initially 20 000 in the first week and then it is followed by 100000 in February we have already received a very large order from an international organisation of 300000 units to be distributed world for the pens and 400000 for the pads. The orders will be delivered according to contact which is being signed by the company by the Keshe foundation, this is a pharmaceutical organisation which sees the pads and the pain as a new way into the work of the foundation we estimate to produce 1 million units across Keshe foundation manufacturing per month with the pens and the pads, we invite more people to join the manufacturing site that we can reach people. The whole structure as I keep on saying is not for the pain pad or whatever is to change the condition and test situations the materials and systems for a space technology so instead of having a lab and doing a secret in the back doors with the black budget we do with the blue budget of the humanity where you do spending the money and the time and you come up with creative situations like this and we change the course we brought this security top secret labs to the kitchens of the homes you’re testing it you’re building it you’re reporting it and all these secret files does not go behind the things to be hidden one day to be used, you test within hours and there is post back on the net.<br>凯：凯史基金会的医疗包与医疗笔在下周会推向市场，我们在星期一被告知我们会收到医疗权威机构发给我们的用以启动发行产品的认证书，我们最初在第一周发行20000个单元，然后在2月会是100000，我们已经收到来自一个国际机构的大量的订单，用来分配到世界各地的，其中有300000个医疗笔和400000个医疗包。这些订单将会根据联系的具体情况发送出去，需要凯史基金会总公司的签署。这是一个医药机构，它看到了医疗包与止痛笔作为一种医疗的基础性的新方式。我们预计在凯史基金会工厂每月生产100万个医疗包与减痛笔。我们邀请更多人进入产品制造的网站，我们能直接接触他们。我一直在说的整个结构不是为医疗包或其他什么准备的，而是改变环境和测试效果，使这种材料与系统作为一种太空科技。相比建造实验室，在黑色的预算的支持下在门后做秘密实验，我们则为人类做公开透明的预算，在这里你花费时间与金钱是你追赶上这个创新的技术，来到这个创新的领域，我们改变了进程，我们使只在实验室中的顶级秘密走进每家每户的家中，厨房中，你们测试它，建造它，报告它，所有这些秘密文件不会被隐藏来等某一天被使用，你需要时间测试它，然后放到网上。<br> It has become a society where you’re helping each other and not us it has become a society where you’re testing not us. Us is me and the team of the Keshe foundation we are there to guide we invest heavily in our times and everything we have to change the course of humanity. In the coming days when we show things it will be amazing what it can be done we are showing new thing what are these?<br>凯：这已经在形成一种社会结构，在这种结构里，你们之间互帮互助，而不是我们。这也正在成为一个社会，在这里是你们在测试，而不是我们。我们是指我以及凯史基金会的团队，我们在那里作指导，我们把一切都投入到能改变人类进程的时间与事情中。在接下来几天，我们所展示的所完成的将是令人称奇的，是崭新的事物。这些是什么？<br>[Rick]; This is something …….in PDS.how to make<br>瑞：这是在个人数字系统中教人们如何做（纳米笔）。<br>[Keshe]; These are people who are going around the world wide web and taking people’s report and then stacking it up what how depends on working how everything else’s working I thank you for what you are doing we appreciate what you are doing<br>凯：这是一些浏览世界各地的网站并收集报告的人，他们把这些累积起来以展示出如何制作产品以及产品是如何运作的，谢谢你们所做的，十分感激。<br>[Rick]; they show us step-by-step process here so one this is one of many here people want to show others how to do it and they end up making these little tutorials and what not and showing some of the ways to make the gans and use a nice little process to make a nano material on the coils put them inside the bottle with a little bit of the potion they call which is<br>瑞：他们在展示如何一步步去做，他们想要教人们如何去做，他们总结出制作这些东西的教程，展示制作甘斯的一些方法，还有用一些巧妙的方法在线圈上进行纳米涂层，然后把它们放在瓶子里，用一点药剂 ，他们把这个药剂叫做……<br>[Mr. Keshe]: let me explain something we have seen something talking about the last 24 hours that the same scare mongering is going on with the same people about the use of the pens use of the pads and everything else the structure of the pens cannot harm no one because it’s not connected to any gene system we advise for it not to be used by the others for clarity that we can follow our progress that we can use a pen for one person to another the reason being first of all its made of copper, copper does not hold any infectious diseases and copper does not hold information which is beyond so it releases itself and the other hand all these pens and all these pads which you are producing we have received certification and what we do is a copy of what you do so in a  what way it’s been certified as seems are safe these what we see on the technology that you can use different part of the finger the hand the animals even we see everything fantastically done. People are testing we see the change we need to bring the change don’t forget this time around we are the only one who is going to fail us and nobody else. We have to understand one thing we work as one team throughout the world we work as one nation one planet one race. In the coming days we will ask you to do something which will bring the Keshe foundation into very direct public arena that is what we would like you to do on the weekend after the 11th of February where we release systems we would like you to walk to build as many pens as you can and walk across your cities and towns and give it and give the pen free to every man and woman you see.<br>凯：让我解释一点事情，我们在过去几天一直在讨论，同样的担忧一样存在于使用医疗笔与医疗包以及其他的人心中，医疗笔的结构不会伤害任何人，因为它并不与任何基因系统相连，为了表达明确，我们建议笔不宜被他人使用，但我们可以根据我们的进展，为他人使用这只笔，原因首先是它是由铜制的，铜不会被传染性的疾病所侵入或融入，铜不会截留超出它本身之外的信息（铜的导体性），所以铜释放它自己。另一方面，你们正在做的所有的减痛笔与医疗包，我们收到了认证，你们做的就是对我们的复制。这是被认证的，是有安全保障的，我们看到这项技术能够用在手指的不同部分上甚至动物的手  ，所有事情都能令人吃惊的应用上。人们正在测试，我们看见了变化，我们需要带来变化，别忘记，这个时刻能让我们失败的只有我们自己，没有任何人能够。我们必须要明白一件事，在全世界范围内，我们是作为一个团队来工作的，我们是作为一个国家、一个行星、一个种族来工作的。在接下来的日子里，我们会要求你们来做一些事情，即把凯史基金会带到更为直接的公众舞台上，在2月11号过后的周末我们希望你们能够这样做，在2月11号我们会释放系统，我们希望你们尽你可能去制造尽可能多的笔，走进你周围的城市或小镇，把这些笔免费分发给你所看见的每个男人与女人。<br>[Rick]: Do you see the meaning of that cartoon?<br>瑞克：你知道那张卡通图片的意思吗？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes I can see, we need you to do this so what we will like you to do is make as many as you can make next 3 weeks the painless weeks for the others. Build as many pens and the pads as you can go out and give it freely to the people and just give them direction go to Keshe foundation and see the information go to the testimonials a piece of paper let us start changing the course by interacting with world population not just on the few pages we budget we do we can do we seen Mike Nasser doing this for a long time and he has changed a lot we seen Thomas in the deserted island where he got hit by the problem in Dominican he has changed the life that direction it is time if we can literally on the 13, Saturday the 13th and Monday, Sunday the 14th February let’s call it the pen day give a pen give a pad just give a t-shirt and tell people you have a pain just put it on it. We have given a CO2 pad to one person with lymph cancer and he could feel the change the first 2 days.<br>凯：是的，我能看懂。我们需要你们这样做，我们需要你们尽可能的制造，接下来的三个星期是无痛周。尽你可能制造更多的笔与包，出去免费发给其他人，让他们走进凯史基金会，去查看更多的信息，去看测试报告的网页。让我们通过与世界其他人的接触一起改变这个进程不只是通过这几页纸。我们做预算支持我们所做，我们能做到。我们看见迈克纳塞尔做这个很长时间了，他改变了很多事情。我们看见托马斯在多米尼加一个荒岛上遇到很多问题，但他以此科技已经改变了自己的生活。是时候了，我们可以把2月13号，2月14号称为“医疗笔日”，给别人一支笔，给别人一个医疗包，告诉他们身上疼就可以戴上它。我们把二氧化碳包给了一个有淋巴癌的人，他在头两天就感受到变化的发生。<br>Let’s make the change we have to interact in a way not talking about peace but the tool of peace everyone every way we can let’s make this day a day and then the following week we do something else once a week we gave the chance to the governments to bring peaceful condition of change they have refused let’s make those 2, 3 days the days where we give the pens up where we give the technology free layout we start with the peace process. 21st 22nd 23rd of January we are on it 21st 22nd 23rd of February next month we can do with as a whole three days three days of peace we as people the start a peace process. Every soldier which carries a gun give them a pen say this is the pen of peace in exchange for your gun, every man who works in the defence technology and the rest give them a pen and a pad it costs nothing tell them it’s the exchange for the many things you produce you kill be safe, save your children, save your life. Let us change surface bring that change in.<br>凯：我们必须要使周围发生改变，我们必须要通过某种方式进行接触互动，而不仅仅是谈论和平，每个人通过每一种方式我们能使这天真正成为有价值的一天；接下来一周，我们每周做一次，做一些别的事情，我们给过政府机会带来和平环境的改变，但它们拒绝了。我们让2,3天成为释放笔的日子，通过这种方式我们释放技术，我们开始和平的进程。1月21,22,23以及2月21,22,23这整个三天都可以作为和平日，我们与人们一起展开和平的进程。每一个拿枪士兵，给他一只笔，说这是和平之笔，用来换你身上的枪；工作在军事防御领域的人，也给他们一只笔和包，这花不了多少，告诉他们这是用来换取你所生产的用来杀人的工具，拯救你的孩子，拯救你的生活。让我们一起来改变，一起把改变带进来。<br> We gave the USB stick to the governments for two years they had it when they opened up they released it and we see where we are today we the chance to the government for six month nothing done we choose the government we place the government in position now we decide to change the peace work 21st 22nd 23rd we are today of January no response we knew there will no response we pushed for the response but it got worse because they know the end is near to them now we call on the world governments to step down and world nation as one nation to step up. Let Keshe foundation supporters on 21st 22nd 23rd following the 12 on the 13th of 13th and 14th to change for every soldier every gun you see carried by man you give them the pen the pen of peace where they can release the pains with the gun they carry. We can do that we done it before we can do it this time at the moment the support of Keshe foundation was over 300 million supporters worldwide people who come on websites worldwide look and go or come on regular basis runs over 150 million. We have become a force we have become a force which spreads the peace of message with technology this never happened before, next week when we show the system when we show the technology for health you understand how easily the hospitals will shut the house down we can put one unit in every street people can walk through it be fed they don’t go hungry people don’t need to be struggled and strangled for food that have to work 8, 10, 12 hours a day at the rate of $1 or $2 or Euros to be able to feed  themselves in the past few days when we see 8, 10 people living in one room working 10 12 hour shifts to be able to stay alive.<br>凯：我们已经给政府U盘有2年了，当他们打开U盘之时，我们就开始释放技术，于是我们看到今天我们走到了哪一步，我们给了政府6个月的时间，什么也没做。是我们选择政府的，是我们把政府放在这样的位置上，现在我们决定去改变实现和平的方式，1月21,22,23作为和平日，政府没有任何回应，我们知道结果会是这样，我们只是在要求回应，但是情况更糟，因为政府他们知道他们的好日子结束了，我们要求世界上的政府下台，要求所有国家建立成一个国家，让凯史基金会的支持者在21,22,23号以及接下来12,13,14号进行改变，你看见任何携带枪支的士兵，给他们笔，和平之笔，他们能用笔消除携带枪支所带来的疼痛。我们以前做过，这次我们能继续做，现在世界范围内的凯史基金会的支持者有3亿人，这些人来自世界各地的网络上，稳定的人群超过1.5亿人。我们正在成为一种力量，我们正在成为一种借助这种科技散播和平信息的力量，这在以前从未发生。下个星期，当我们展示这个技术，当我们展示这种医疗技术的时候，你会明白医院是怎样容易垮台的，我们能把这个单元放在街上走的每一个人身上，人们就能通过它得到能量供给，他们不会变的饥饿，不会再为了食物而挣扎与奋斗，不用再为了食物去一天工作8个小时、10个小时、12个小时以得到1或2美元或欧元的报酬，用来填饱自己。在过去几天中，我们看到8,10个人在一个房间里持续的轮换工作10到12个小时以此才能养活自己。<br>Caroline and I were ashamed of being human when we seen what we were told. This is the reality of on of the most advanced nations in this world. 7 10 people living in one room we gonna release the pictures. One of the most prosperous nations in the world looks prosperous on top but the people who work to keep it going cannot feed themselves they are working they are not peasants they are not unemployed they are fully employed 12 hours a day seven of them can afford one room just because they need to feed themselves and to feed their families where with 100 dollars we can have full insurance cover with this system full feeding cover with the system full energy with the system then do we need to be overused. We gave the world leaders a chance and I said before we enter in the world of the political peace very strong in 2016 and now we start. Make as many pens as you can pads as you can a tissue paper you all seen using a pad with one copper oxide CO2 can change the pain. Give it to a soldier go in front of the arm manufacturing’s defence technologies and say this is a pen for the piece use it I change for your gun this is what is does it brings you peace to exchange. We need to do this if you’re going to achieve world peace in a fast through technology you don’t have the money send the request to the Keshe foundation we can we support you to make the units to give to them if you have the finances donate to the to Keshe foundation because you seen what we done. We do not live hand of we given comfortable life we allow the people who work get paid comfortably that they can sell comfortable.<br>凯：当卡洛琳和我被告知这样的事情的时候，我们都为是人类而感到羞耻。这是在大多数发达国家中现实生活中的一部分，7到10个人住在一个房间里，我们得释放这些图片，世界上最繁荣国家中的一个国家看起来很是繁荣，处在顶端，但人们为维持生存在不停的工作，甚至不够养活自己，他们在工作，不是农民，没有失业，他们一天12小时在工作，他们中的7个人不能支付房租，因为他们要养活自己与家人，而用100美元我们就能用这个系统给我们全面的保险，全面的能量供应，那么我们还需要被他人雇佣和利用吗？我们给过世界领导者们一次机会，在2016年我有足够的力量正式进入世界政治性和平事业之前我说过，现在我们开始。制作尽可能多的笔和医疗包，一个面纸，氧化铜以及CO2制作减痛包。把它给士兵，到国防科技工厂的门前，告诉他们这是用来换取和平的额笔，用它吧，用你的枪来换。这就是应该做的，它给你带来和平。我们必须这样做，如果你想通过这项科技快速的在世界范围内实现和平的话，你没有钱，向凯史基金会发出请求，我们能支持你，制造这些单元，然后发送给你。如果你有资金想要捐赠给凯史基金会，因为你已经看到我们所做的了。我们不能靠双手获得舒适的生活的话，我们能让人们能得到舒心的报酬，也能让他们卖的合理。<br>All the members of the Keshe foundation team you see are paid at the highest level we can pay to live a comfortable life their headache is mine I saw them today they sell the life for the humanity. We are looking for heavy investments in Africa in Europe there are more hungry children go to bed than in Africa because in Africa there learn over centuries how to eat that they can have something for the night in the west that’s saved in that training has gone. Let us change the course we change the course from today is your decision you cannot afford wires you cannot afford caustic write to the foundation we try to help we pay for the tools of peace those of you who can afford donate, donate to us because we work very closely in trying to achieve what we can achieve what we can distribute. We sell our systems at the very high prices because the difference goes directly into the research develop and building of the support and what you have seen in Africa and Benjieming get paid the highest wages in Africa by this start making the change. Alex is the same with the wages he gets paid he can live a comfortable life in England and be very happy with it he chooses that Africa because that’s where he is works on the ethos of the foundation this is same in different part of the world. Let us make a date we promise you we deliver you a full health system by the 11th of February. We need your support on the 13th and the 14th to give the first pain pads to the citizen of your city and on the 21st 22nd 23rd of February to man of military. We go with the people when you give a pen say if the pen works and you have less pain and it helps you anywhere use the pen make another one teach them what to do, give them a paper to make it and say next week we meet the army.<br>凯：所有凯史基金会团队的成员被支付一个很高水平的薪酬用以过上舒适的生活，他们头疼的就是我头疼的，我看见今天他们在为人类服务而牺牲自己的生活。我们需求在非洲巨额的投资，在欧洲我们看见更多的儿童带着饥饿去睡觉，因为在非洲，人们几个世纪都在学习，知道怎么获取食物，他们在晚上有准备的食物。而在西方这种为生存的训练与技巧已经看不见了。让我们改变这个过程，你们来决定从今天来改变这个过程，如果你们支付不起线圈，支付不起烧碱，写信给基金会，我们想办法帮助你，我们来支付这种和平的工具；那些愿意捐赠的人，捐赠给我们，因为我们能够很紧密的工作以实现我们的目标以及我们分配的事情。我们以一个很高的价格出售我们的系统，是因为这其中的差额利润被直接用在研发、发展、支持中心的构建上以及你所看见的在非洲的项目。本杰明被支付最高的工资用以支持他在非洲的工作，在非洲我们看到了改变。阿历克斯也一样，他同样被支付最高的工资，能够在伦敦过很舒适很开心的生活，他选择非洲，因为在那里工作能够践行基金会的理念与精神，我们在世界其他地区也看到同样的事情。让我们做一个约定，我们向你们承诺，我们在2月11号给你们一个完全医疗系统，而我们需要你们在13与14号分发你的医疗笔与减痛包给你的邻居，给你生活的城市中其他的人，在2月21,22,23号给军队里的人。我们与这些人在一起，当你给别人笔时，说，如果这只笔起作用，你减少了痛苦，它无论在哪里都能帮助你，使用这只笔，做另外一支笔，教他们如何去做，给他一张纸去制作它，并且说下个星期在军队里见面。<br>We need to make this step 2016 is the year of the peace, peace decided by the people not by those who sit in the high nations and cause more wars. If you remember when the wall came down when there was conflict they put roses on the tip of guns now we put science on the tip of guns a gun for exchange for a pain pad for a pain pen for peace. We make the move of the peace not the governments let me tell you what happens when the world leaders signs an agreement for a jet liner to be bought a fighter plan to be bought for arms to be bought for his nation 5 to 10% of the contract goes in his private accounts. Maybe a lot of you don’t know this I’ve been there in signing of contracts I’ve been there as one of the top man watched how we have to pay the world leaders to sign to buy arms to kill more. I said I have every paper to prove and somebody who opposes the Keshe foundation sitting aboard has confirmed you I have the private telephone numbers of the world leaders and even their mistresses I am that close I know it’s operated. Every time you see a $1 billion deal for arms hundred to 200,000 actually 100,000,000 goes to the family of the private life of the presidents and the people who sign it that’s  why they can sell arms , arms are sold with bribery at a very high level.<br>凯：我们需要跨出这一步，2016年是和平之年，和平是由人们来决定的，而不是由那些身处高位发动战争的人来决定的。如果你还记得的话，当年柏林墙倒了后，人们把玫瑰花插在枪口上，而现在我们把科学插在枪口上，一支枪交换一个医疗包，一支笔，与和平。我们在推动和平的进程而不是政府，让我告诉你们发生的是什么，当领导人为军队为国家签署购买喷气式飞机以及战斗机时，5%到10%的合同金进入到其交易的账户。可能你们大多数人都不知道，我就在那里签署过这样的合同，我就在那里作为最高层人员之一看到我们是怎样付钱给领导人让其购买杀伤性武器的。我说过我有所有能证明（这些事）的材料，某个在座的反对凯史基金会的人已经确认到你了。我有世界世界各国领导人的私人电话以及他们的情妇，我知道里面的黑幕，里面的运作。每次有10亿的军事交易，就有10万到20万，实际上是1亿进入到那些总统以及签署协议的人的家庭私生活中，这就是为什么他们要卖武器，武器在贿赂的支持下被售以很高的价格。<br>Now we exchange it peace costs nothing we don’t give bribes our bribe is to take your pain away we give you a comfortable life. Every 1 million euro spent on arms up to 350 million of is bribe to the officials from the government that they sign to buy and to the officials who arrange the contracts to sell it. We know one present, ex-president that in his cycle of presidency has banked in $13 billion just as bribe and we can show where the money has been spent. Every time you see a signature a new arm deal it means 1,350,000,000 bribe has been paid to the agents to the secretary of the state to the Prime Minister’s office who bought it and to the one who sold it now you decide who is actually peaceful while there is so much war going on. Change peace science knowledge or guns. Go on the internet and encourage people to do I’m print everything on the blue paper the color of the SSI it’s where we are going into space we have enough and we will build enough the Keshe foundation supporters are quiet in time will respond enough. You wanted the peace the peace is in your hand. We gave six months of the government now we got 12 months for public. Don’t go and march just go out and walk and just give a pen to every citizen. You have a pain tested and if it works do the same. We teach freely but our freedom comes at a cost the peace. We need to change and the change comes with us we gave governments a time they failed we chose the governments we cannot fail we cannot blame our governments because we are the government we are the public we are one race one nation. Do we have Ali online?<br>凯：现在我们来交换，和平不花费什么，我们不贿赂，我们的贿赂只是把你的疼痛带走还给你一个舒适的生活。用在武器交易上的每一百万欧元就有350万欧元进入到政府官员的腰包以让他们签署购买的协议，这些钱也进入到安排这个合同项目的人的身上。我们知道一个前任总统在他的任期中将13亿美元的贿赂存进自己的银行账户，我们还能展示这些钱是如何被消费的。每一次你看到一个武器购买合同的签署就意味着13亿5千万的贿赂进入到代理人身上，进入到国家秘书处，进入到购买武器的首相办公室，以及进入到卖武器的人身上。现在你能认清谁是和平的，为什么世界上有这么多战争在进行。改变使世界和平，你们选择科学知识还是枪支？到网上去鼓励人们去做，我把所有事情都印在蓝色的纸上，就是SSI的颜色，这就是我们要进入太空的地方，我们有的已经足够了，我们建造的已经足够了，凯史基金会的支持者一直很安静，但适时我们会相当有力的表达我们的诉求。你想要和平，和平就在你手。我们给了政府六个月时间，现在我们给公众12个月时间。不要游行示威，只要走出去给每个人发一支笔。你已经对笔进行了测试，如果它有用，就做一样的。我们自由免费的教学，但我们的自由是以和平为基础的，我们需要改变，改变也与我们同在，我们给政府一个时间，他们没有做到，是我们选择政府的，我们不能失败，我们不能责怪政府，因为我们就是政府，我们就是公众，我们是一个种族一个国家。阿里在线吗？<br>[Ali]: Hi Mr. Keshe yes I’m online<br>阿里：在这里，在线。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; can you tell us what development we have with you?<br>凯：你能告诉我们有什么最新的进展吗？<br>[Ali]: Yeswe took the unit outdoors at my friend’s house and we had the people coming in and the is as open space about half an hour to one hour later we another rain coming so covered the unit with tar. We basically was similar to what was happening inside the house and saw the shimmers lightening like things around the house and can you come here she is my friend that we are at her house right now. Can we start the video turn on the start video, and we share your screen so that you have.<br>阿里：好的。我们把装置拿到户外，我一个朋友的房子的旁边。有一些其他人过来，这是这个空旷的地方，大概半小时或一小时左右下起了雨，于是我们用幕布把装置覆盖起来。我们基本上和在房子里看到的现象一致，看见围绕在房子周围的一些闪光，能过来这边吗？她是我的朋友，我们正在她的房子旁边。我能打开视屏吗？是的， 打开视屏，你能看见吗？<br>[Person]: myself I was, I was outside today we have seen a lot of flashes like fast flashes I thought someone was turn their camera on or their phone on but that wasn’t the case it was just light flashing, personally since I have been experiencing the plasma energy I have eradicated really bad pain in the shoulder my eye sight has improves my near sightedness has completely improved I can read again it’s just, I don’t understand it it’s totally new it’s like inside my stomach it just kinda holds the energy it’s not bad or good it’s just something I’m not, I’ve never experienced before I have a lot more energy and I can really see it when I am in it I felt like I was connected to it today as at the time when the plasma connected to the trees I felt it, I felt the trees, it connected and then it’s just the tips of the trees just disappeared most of the trees are on the properties the top part thought it would disappear from me.<br>阿里的朋友：我在，今天我在外面我们看见大量的闪光，很快，我以为是有人在转动他们的相机或手机，但并不是这样，就只是像灯一样在闪，就我的经历而言，自从我经历体验了等离子体能量，我已经根治了在我肩膀的剧烈的疼痛，我的视力也有改善，我的近视已经得到明显改善，我又能读了，它是，我不理解，这是完全新的东西，它就像在我的胃部里积蓄着能量，说不上好与坏，它就是某种东西，我从来没有经历这些…..今天我好像能与它产生连接，当等离子体与树产生连接时，我感受到了，我感受到了树，它连接，在树的树梢上消失了，从我这边看，它在树的顶部就消失了<br> When it started to rain it started to rain a little bit and the plasma connected really strongly to the water element and I could that again quite strongly it’s just an amazing for my own personal experience it’s been quite life altering he was just one night that I stayed in Ali’s place that all of this shifted my eye sight the next morning after I stayed in the plasma energy overnight my eyes watered all day they just watered and then the next day my sight was cleared. So I am quite excited to go check it out to see how much it is actually changed and thank you thank you so much.<br>阿里的朋友：当开始下雨，等离子体开始与水元素发生强烈的连接，我能看见，是很强烈的，对我来说这是一个非常奇妙的体验，全新的生命改变，在那晚我呆在阿里的房子里，第二天就完全转变了我的视力状况，我整晚呆在等离子体能量中，我的眼睛一直在流水，一直流，然后第二天我的视力就清晰了，于是我兴奋的出去看，看这些改变的效果，很明显的改变，谢谢，十分感谢。<br>[Ali]: so its amazing experiences we are having and I took some footages from the unit so when I take my camera in the middle there is a bit of a circle as you point the camera toward the plasma unit you will see that there is area is looks like a circle and if you move the camera to other areas out in the city you don’t see that it becomes plain black and when its back you see that circle putting it in the chat for people who want to download the footage make sure to watch it in a really high quality screen if you watch it on low quality you gonna miss it you watch it on high quality like apple iPhone or if you have a really good screen see that so I just posted the link online and if I show it on Zoom because the Zoom takes the quality down is really hard to see but if you like I can still show that what do you think?<br>阿里：这是我们令人惊奇的经历。我们对装置作了一些录像。当我把录像机对着装置的中间，有一个小圈，当你把相机对准等离子体装置时，你会看见一个区域就像一个小圈，如果你将相机移向其他事物就看不到什么，黑漆漆一片，当你再次对准装置时，你又看见了小圈，我们把它放到聊天室里以方便想要下载这个视屏的人，要确保观看的时候是高清的像素，如果你的像素比较低，你将看不清楚，高像素如用苹果手机，你要有一个好的屏幕。我刚把这个衔接发到网上了，如果我缩放它，因为缩放会使像素变低，很难看清，如果你想要我展示，你认为呢？<br>[Mr. Keshe]:Show see what we can do go ahead because when people can go and watch it on the net okay.<br>凯：展示吧，我们才能继续前进，当人们能够在网上看到它</p>
<p>[Ali]: Okay so I just posted the link if you like you can see it.<br>阿里：好，我刚放上这个衔接，如果你能够看到它的话<br>[Rick]: I put it  in the live stream off<br>瑞克：我把它放到直播上<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We’ve seen a lot of people have started making these units a lot of people have started making the new energy battery units which we saw it on Tuesday, I’m wanna go through this because Alex is not here we have developed it from ways of doing it lets see what you have if you get anything you develop systems I have seen a large number of people posting these 5 stacker units now. Tell how you feel what you experience how do you feel and what you see this test should be done in a closed very big barn that the air cannot affect the position till then you can get it out.<br>凯：我们已经看见很多人正在开始做这些单元，很多人正在开始做我们在周二所看到的新电池系统，我想要再说明一下，因为阿历克斯不在这里，我们从各种途径对它进行了改进，让我们看看你现在手上的，如果你正在发展你的系统，我看见大量的人正在展示5个能量层单元组合。告诉我们你们的感受，你们有什么体验，以及你看到什么。这个测试应该在一个封闭的很大的仓库里进行，以使空气不能影响里面的状态，一直到你出来为止。</p>
<p>[Ali]: So this is the if you can see my screen it was raining at this time and we put it outside we put a tarp on it’s an orange tarp and it was still raining and the unit was still working and if I turn the camera to the left it becomes dark completely dark but if I move it toward the unit there is lie a orb or a circle on the middle of the screen I don’t know how well you can see on Zoom and there is shimmers and stuff I send the original rar file that way you can put it on the high quality screen and have a look at it. It’s about 1 minute or so and we go back and forth and compare that and even if turn that light off the was reflecting on the unit you will still see the same effect so whenever you point to the unit it will you see that circle effect on the unit. Last night I worked on turning my coils 90 degrees so all of the coils are now at 90 degrees similar to what was discussed in the international knowledge seekers. Rick do you see any the thing that I am explaining that in the middle you see some kind of a circle or energy field?<br>阿里：这就是你在我的屏幕上所看到的，那时正在下雨 ，它放在外面，我们在上面放上油布，这是一个橘黄色的油布，正在不停的下雨，装置仍在运行，如果我把相机调向左边，就变得完全漆黑，但当我把相机对向装置时，就会在屏幕中间出现圆形物或小圈 ，我不知道你在这个缩放的视屏里看得怎么样，但在我上传的原始视屏中有微光和一些东西，你可以放在高清的屏幕中观看，这有大概1分钟，视屏里画面是来回比较的，即使我关掉灯，装置仍有反射，你仍会看到一样的效果， 无论何时你把相机指向装置，你仍会在装置上看到有圆圈的效果。昨晚我把线圈转换成90度，现在所有的线圈都是90度了，就像在国际知识寻求者的讨论中说的一样。瑞克，你能看到我解释的在中间的类似圆圈或者能量场的东西吗?</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: We don’t see anything so<br>凯：我们看不见什么。<br>[Ali]: Okay<br>阿里：好。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Because I am not a high resolution what do you call it laptop.<br>凯：因为我没有高的分辨率，就像你们说的笔记本电脑。<br>[Ali]; okay sure so please download the file I just sent it to the chat and have a look at the higher resolution.<br>阿里：好，请下载文件，我刚传到聊天室，在高清分辨率里观看。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you send me the link too please<br>凯：请发给我们衔接<br>[Ali]: Yes I will send you the link the other thing I saw somebody post on my Facebook which was really interesting was the plasma UFO that was seen over in Russia and Australia and also New York and the shape of these is pretty interesting and it’s in popular news would you allow me to show this? Il bring it over it was seen on 17th of December 2015 and I wanted Mr. Keshe to verify that if we create these plasma UFOs whether it’s going to look something similar to this so I’m going to move it<br>阿里：好，我会发衔接的。另一件事情是我看见有人在我的脸书上发帖，很有趣，他说等离子体UFO在俄国，澳大利亚以及纽约被目击，这些东西的形状很有趣，现在成为一个公众新闻了，我可以放一下吗？是在2015年12月17号的看见的，我想要凯史先生验证一下我们创造的这些等离子体UFO是否与这是相似的，所以我要播放一下<br>[Rick]: I dont think  we should we play the news program so<br>瑞克：我不认为我们应该播放新闻栏目，所以<br>[Ali]: This is the picture so this looks like a plasma UFO that was shot over in Russia  and these are footages from around the world the people have recorded it and I was wondering if the star formation that  we are creating is it gonna create something similar to this field<br>阿里：这个图片看起来像等离子体UFO   ，是在俄国被目击，这些视屏来自世界各地，人们拍了下来，我想知道我们正在创造的星型组合是否能创造与这个场相似的东西<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We don’t usually comment on this thing we try to keep away from showing these thing I prefer you not to show<br>凯史：我们通常不对这些东西发表评论，我们试图与这些东西保持距离，所以我建议你不要展示。<br>[Ali]: Okay I will pause<br>阿里：好的，我将停下来</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]; I release the picture of the lighting in summer because I was there I took it myself and it was shown the reality is that if you create a strong enough field you will see it.<br>凯：我释放了在夏天的闪光的图片，因为我在那里，我自己做的，它被展示出来，真实情况是如果你创造足够强大的场，你就会看见它。<br>[Ali]: Okay<br>阿里：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: I have seen couple of units which I think there will show such a position where you have to allow this situation to build up if you have like a bomb that you can put it that there is no interaction at least 10 and 20m with the system he will be kept in that then you can build up the plasmas specially if you use the new battery capacitors which we introduced that give some building up till we gets a point that it reaches the transformation. You can use as part of your system a Magrav system which you have built or you buy it from the foundation where you connect the batteries after the Magrav systems and you connect the load side to your system so the power you put into your system is a Magrav system what this means is that you have a power supply from the grid you connect this into a Magrav system box and then you connect the load side into the new batteries as a on the negative side and then you connect this to yourfivestacker this combination converts electric energy into the plasma energy and what you feed into your system is total plasma then you can reach high fields within the circle if your system is set in the right way so you put your system out now in the field and is relying on the batteries which you have made you build what you can do connect your battery or your system from your batteries into a new battery set capacitor battery unit we taught or connect it directly to a Magrav system which you had connect it to the main power to the grid this box converts your energy totally into Magrav so now you can control the flight feed I tell you I am taking you step by step for work<br>凯：我看见过几个我认为能产生这种状态的装置，你要能够让这种状态建立起来，如果你有一个比如炸弹，你能把它放在离装置10到20米的距离，在这样的距离就不能发生互动，它就这样保持着，然后你能建立等离子体，尤其当你使用我们介绍的新的电池电容单元时，<br>就能产生一种建构，这种建构能让你达到实现转换的位置点。你能使用它作为你的磁引力场系统的一部分，这个磁引力场无论是你建造的还是你从基金会买的，将电池连接在磁引力场装置的后面，然后将负载的一端连接到你的系统，所以你放入你的系统中的能量源是磁引力场装置，这个意思是你有来自电网的能量供应 ，将其连接到磁引力装置 ，然后你将负载端负极连接到新的电池 （实心点是负极，竖杠是电池），再将其连接到5个能量层 ，这种组合将电能 （左边）转换为等离子体能量 （右边圆圈），你所供给给你的系统的是整个等离子体，然后你能在这个圆圈中达到高磁场 ，如果你的设置合理的话；如果你把系统拿出来放在磁场中 ，依靠你所制作的这些电池 （下面方块），然后将电池连接到新的电池上 ，或电容电池 （左上方方块），再将其连接到磁引力场系统 （左下方方块），再连接到主要能源-电网上 （左边圆圈），这个盒子 （中间的磁引力场盒子）能将能量全部转换为磁引力场，这样你就能控制飞行能量 （右边大圈），我在一步步教你。<br>[Ali]; In a standalone where we don’t have access to the electrical power from the grid what is the best way to fit it because it’s going to …<br>阿里：在户外时，我们没有办法连上电网的能量，怎样使最好的办法去满足她，因为它将会…..<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Use the battery, use a normal battery car battery connect your Magrav power unit to it and convert into plasma you Magrav power unit are converted from electrical vibration to a plasma condition so this way you can feed your system till you reach your energy point you want that it allows you to create the full dome and control it. You have built the first phase I have seen a lot of people are building these 5 stackers move it one stacker to 4 stack take the top stack if you want off we can always add the 5th one on top so when you built your stacker you keep it as it is and then feed it to the batteries which you already built because those batteries are essential I tell you what you what this will do in a later date actually we can tell you now if you remember when you made these batteries the 70-80 batteries you made for your systems Ali I asked you to put different kind of food into it like I don’t know orange or whatever did you do that?<br>凯：用电池，普通的电池，汽车的电池，将你的磁引力场装置连上它，然后转换为等离子体，你的磁引力场装置将电能转换为等离子体能量环境，这样你能供给你的系统直到你达到一个你想要的能量点 ，即能让你创造一个完全圆顶状的你能控制的能量点 ，你建造了第一阶段 （上面的5个能量层），我看见很多人在建造这5个能量层，移走一个能量层变成4个能量层，如果你想要的话就拿走最上面的一层，你能随时将第5个能量层加上去，当你建造了你的能量层，将它变成这样 （星型组合），然后用你建造的电池供给它 ，这些电池是必要的，我告诉过你这些会在未来用到，事实上，我们现在就能告诉你，当你做这些电池时，为你的系统制作70到80个电池时，阿里，我要求你将不同的食物放进去比如橘子或者什么 ，你做了吗？<br>[Ali]: yes I put I blended mango banana and apple and I had the inner core dipped it in and I basically fire it up and made it nano and then put CO2 gans around it and put another coil around it<br>阿里;是的，我混合芒果香蕉和苹果，将其浸润里面的核心，然后火烧制成纳米涂层，再把CO2甘斯淋在周围，再把另一个线圈绕在外面<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay so what these units we should put food into in your plasmas into your batteries these becomes the food when you built up your structure so now you can connect your unit into your system so your Magrav system now converts electric power into a plasma power and then you can control it till you build a powerful enough plasma generated that you don’t need this and now one of these power generators is the new battery setup which we taught on Tuesday international teaching. Please go on the Keshe foundation international teaching and look at it, what it is I am not going to go into a lot of depth into it some other people have tried it already since Tuesday have achieved the process.<br>凯：好，我们应该放什么到这些装置里，放食物到你的等离子体，到你的电池中，当你构建你的结构 （圆顶）的时候这些变成食物 ，所以现在你可以将你的单元连接到你的系统即磁引力场装置 （笔所指），连接电源再将电能转换为 （左边为电源）等离子体能量，然后你就能控制它 （右边星型组合），直到你能产生一个足够强大的等离子体能量，你就不需要左边这些东西了，这个新的产生能源的电池 就是我在星期二国际教学中所讲的。请到凯史基金会国际教学中去看。它是什么，我不会大量的继续深入的讲下去，因为星期二取得进展后，人们已经试过很多了。<br>What you do with the new system is that I put it this way that I can use the full page, you have your centre wire which you use for the capacitor, you use what we have seen and I explain this I forgot to explain this on Tuesday your wire try to use a standard wire in a cable so the wire you use here is a stranded wire the ones in the wall used for electricity your equipment they hardly nowadays get a solid wire and cables all the wire cables used in the house in the electrical equipment is stranded what you need to do is you need to nano coat the wire inside the plastic do not take the plastic of the different ways of doing this and that is you nano, you allow this wire to be nano coated with its plastic jacket one way to do it you put the wire you cut it 20cm wire put in a coca cola bottle you out one end of it in the coca cola bottle you put caustic in the coca cola bottle and as you see as you done the coca cola experiment the only way which the caustic and the plasma can go is through the gap inside the wire so your wire gets nano coated perfectly when you see black and copper wire and this end it means your wire is nano coated some other ways to do it some people are doing it is they are cutting the plastic taking the wire nano coating it and putting it back in the plastic it’s all the same then what you have to do this jacket the plastic Jacket has to be nano coated it has to go in the caustic you understand the reason now then you put on this a layer or what we had the tissue what you put the gans on it you put your tissue here and so you have a tissue paper gans here so this is your gans I try to do it in a way that you all can see. This you gans and this is your plastic and this is the wire which is in the centre so you have put the gans of material here now what you do you put on half of your capacitor an aluminium foil so what you have now is this side is gansed with the tissue this side gans with aluminium. Now what is done if you remember when we had the aluminium with the coil on it this forms our battery, battery combination and we do 2 of these on the paper side what Alex has added is his added 3 of these so now what we have is combination of a battery with the storage what we call capacitance the system continues to produces feeds the battery, battery feeds back itself.<br>凯：怎么处理你的新系统呢？我这样来，以便可以用到整个页面。你有一个制作电容器的中间的线 ，你用我们看过和解释的，这个我在星期二教学中忘记解释了，你的线，试着用电缆里面的标准线 ，所以这根线是标准线 ，墙里面用作通电的连接设备的线，如今你们很难得到一个稳固的电缆线，所有在墙里的用来连接设备的电缆线都不是很好的，你需要做的就是给这个塑料膜（壳）里的线进行纳米涂层， ，不用取下塑料膜（壳），有不同的方法这样做，这就是纳米涂层，与塑料膜（壳）一起纳米涂层，你切下20CM的线，一个可口可乐瓶子，将线的末端放进可口可乐瓶子里，然后倒入烧碱，你就完成了可口可乐实验，烧碱和等离子体能够通入的唯一路径是线内的间隙 ，于是你的线就得到完美的纳米涂层，你就会在末端看见黑色的铜线 ，一些其他人做的方法是将塑料取下，将里面的线进行纳米涂层后，再放回塑料中，这也是一样的。你要做的是，这个塑料外衣也要被纳米涂层，也要浸泡在烧碱里，你知道原因，然后你加上一层面纸，在上面涂上甘斯，你把面纸放在这里 （黄色框），在这里也是甘斯面纸 ，所以这是甘斯，我这样画你们都能看到，这是甘斯 ，这是塑料 ，这是在中间的线，所以你要把甘斯材料放在这里 ，然后在你的电容器一半的身上包裹上铝箔 （外层黑色部分），那么你现在有什么呢？就是这一边是甘斯纸， ，这一半边是甘斯与铝 ，什么做好了呢，如果你还记得，我们在这个铝上裹上线圈 ，这就形成我们的电池，电池组合，我们做两个 。在这个甘斯面纸上阿历克斯加上去的是3个线圈 ，现在我们得到的就是这边是一个电池的组合 ，这边是容器 （右边），这就是叫做电容器，这个系统持续的给电池部分功能，然后电池部分再反馈回去。<br>What you done is you connect the end of the first to centre wire was your negative then you decide to connect what you do in what way to make it a power generator or use it as part of another connection with another system of the same to connected to the battery to the probe of the house to speed up the nano coating and free energy in the house. Go back on the international teaching of this week on the Keshe foundation knowledge seekers and you see so with this system we have introduced a new way of work a battery plus a capacitor you can connect one end to your system and the other as a negative and a positive so you convert whatever you put here you put a  DC or  AC on here at this end you convertor of the plasma you get the total plasma energy don’t forget all your things aluminium or titanium and everything else has to be nano coated in the plastic jacket has to be nano coated it has to be put in the caustic to be nano coated the reason you put the stranded wire with this cover into the caustic is because once you rap it straight away with the paper and the gans in the past if tried Alex’s beads as  energy supply after 5 or 10 days, 10 20 days the energy slowly withered it was not there anymore because the interaction of the plasma could not be cleared, here with the presence of the plastic you continuously being in a caustic you release atomic structure hydrogen the way same as the universe don’t forget the all the plastic have a C-H bond.<br>凯：把第一个线圈的末端连接到中间的线圈上就是负极 ，然后你来决定连接什么，使它成为一个更强的能量产生器，或者作为连接上另一系统的一部分，将房间的插头连上这里电池，从而加速房间系统的纳米化，以及增加房间里的自由能。回到这个星期凯史基金会知识寻求者的国际教学里，你会看到相关的。所以这样我们就介绍了一个新的系统：电池+电容 ，你可以将你的电容器的一端连上你的系统 ，另一边 作为一个负极或者正极，所以你能转换，无论你这里放上什么 （笔所指），放上AC或者DC，然后在这一端 ，你就得到等离子体的转换，你就得到完全的等离子体能量，别忘记这个铝箔或钛箔 或其他的都必须进行纳米涂层，你的塑料也要纳米涂层，要放在烧碱中进行纳米涂层，你把线连同塑料一起放入烧碱中，因为一旦你把线缠绕在甘斯纸上，如果你以前用过阿历克斯珠子作为能量供应，在5天，10天，20天后能量逐渐枯萎，直至没有，因为等离子体的交互作用不能清晰的显现，这里的等离子体环境 ，你持续的浸泡在烧碱中就能释放出氢的原子结构这就像宇宙的运作方式一样，不要忘记所有的等离子体环境都有碳氢键。<br>The C continues to become part of the gans of the CO2 in your layer and the H becomes an energy plasma release this new system this new battery combination plasma capacitor will give you a total new dimension in the energy production if you connect one of these middle of the 3 to earth through the experience we have you will create a sinusoidal feedback so you can connect this to earth and connect the other part of It if you want into your system to create a post which is needed to release the plasma in your Magrav unit the system become a generator. We know this we done this, this is experienced on long time ago we are aware what it can do it’s for you to expand it you need for the full system such a combination I call this unit A unit. What we see which is the most advantageous to do is to put 4 As in parallel and then connect every 4 if I call this a B unit, you need to put 4 B units in series if in all the 4 you connect what we called here if I call this one because it’s a capacitor C2 if you connect at least one of the C2 here earth or any of the 4 you will find out you create the impost looking for that triggers the power generation in the Magrav you build or you buy from us or you bought from the foundations around the world. Now this system become a generator you will see it will take time for it to work the way to speed it up you can put this into your power supply connect it to the grid and then connect this to your Magrav system you will up to 100% reduction in total electricity consumption in the specific cases if you stand the correct way. This is the way to break through the shackles of the energy control don’t forget test it and let us know this what we see this is what we are testing and this is how we see the generated power unit to become the what do you call the Magrav unit to become public generators we will develop this technology this side as additional unit to the power Magrav unit when the full test come teh  formations come so if you test it and tell us is correct as well it helps us to be able to speed it up.<br>凯：碳持续的变成CO2甘斯层中的一部分 （黑点），氢就变成能量形式的等离子体释放出来，这个新的系统新的电池组合新的等离子体电容器给你一个在能量生产上的全新的维度，如果你把这三个线圈的一个连上地线（或土地） （下面黑色箭头），根据我们的经验，如果你做的正确，你就会有一个正弦曲线式的能量反馈 ，然后把它的另一部分连接上你的系统 （这个线圈的另一边），就会产生能量投射，能够在你的磁引力场装置中产生等离子体释放，这个系统就会成为一个发动机。我们知道这个，我们做过这个，这是我们很久以前的经验，我们意识到这能做什么，你需要去扩展它，你需要为这整个系统，我叫它A单元 ，最有利做的是把4个A并联起来 ，然后我们把这4个A我们就叫B单元 ，你需要把4个B组成一个系列 ，如果这4个都连接上，这里的电容我叫它C2 ，如果你连接至少一个C2到地上 ，或者这4个中任何一个C2连到地上，你就会创造一个你所需要的输入，能够激发你的磁引力场装置中的能量，不管是你买的还是自己做的装置。现在这个装置成为了一个发动机，你会看到它需要时间来工作，能够让其加速的方法是将这一端连上电源电网 （左边），然后将另一头连上你的磁引力场装置 （右边），你将会看到在特定例子中你会减少100% 的电能消耗，如果你做的正确的话。这就是打破能源控制与束缚的方法，别忘了，测试它，报告给我们，这就是我们所看见所测试的，这就是能量单元怎么变成磁引力场单元，变成公共的发电机，我们将会发展这项技术作为磁引力场装置的附加装置，当全面的额测试报告出来，整体架构出来时。所以你测试后就反馈给我们，这样我们就可以加速进程。<br>This gives you the power energy as a battery this gives you the power energy as a capacitor one feeds back to the other you can even connect one of these directly to back to back to the capacitor feeds the system too where on the other hand you can connect your capacitor to this end don’t forget don’t look at the connections as a matter state looks at this connections as a plasmatic state go on the teachings of the Thursday with Alex we went through it then you understand exactly what we are told how we are developing it. I tried to get hold of the drawings that we can go back on the same papers  that we can see these are papers that we went through and the plan of the system he has explained thoroughly how you will go from a you can use one as a power unit and one as, for load and one as for plug system that you  can connect to your plugs we have explained this thoroughly this step-by-step in the teaching of Thursday on Tuesday went on international teaching go over it and I am sure as part of the Keshe foundation worldwide with the intelligence we gathered and we have  amongst us we can improve on this drastically so if we follow this method we think over all we have managed to change the Magrav power system into the power system. I have seen something very interesting as I said the enemies of the foundation not the enemies ones who have been paid by the governments to create a lot of mistrust and distrust that they write that you are criminals because when this Magrav system explode when I read I could not stop laughing if any of you have built or seen or shows this people have no sense have never made they just been paid to put words on the internet<br>凯：这一边给你能量动力作为电池部分，这一边给你能量动力作为电容部分 ，其中一个反馈给另外一个，你能将其中一个连接到后面部分  ，于是这个电容部分也能供给这个系统。你能把这个线圈的一端与这个线圈的一端连接起来 ，别忘记，不要将这样的连接看成物质状态下的连接，而要将其看成等离子体状态下的连接，去星期四与阿历克斯的教学，你就会明白我说的是什么意思，以及我们怎样发展它的。我试着保留这些图画，我们在这些纸张上回到以前的教学去，你能看见我们在这些纸张上面是怎么走过来的，他完全解释了你怎么去做这个系统，你能使用它作为能量装置，一个作为负载，一个作为插入系统，这样你可以连接到你的插头，     ，我们完全是一步步的教，在星期四，以及星期二的国际教学中，你可以去温习一下，我肯定作为世界凯史基金会的智力总成的一部分，我们所有的智力能够不断的将之戏剧化的改善。如果我们遵循这样的步骤，我们就能深思熟虑，就能将磁引力场装置转变为能量装置，我看见很有意思的事情，就像我所说的，我们基金会的敌人，不是说那些被政府雇佣的，他们创造了很多的误解，他们写信说，你们的额磁引力场装置会爆炸，我看后忍不住笑了，如果你们中任何人建造过，看过或展示过这个，都会认为这些人完全没有理解，完全没有做过，他们只是被付薪水在网上发表一些言论。<br>Can you explode this? This is what’s in the system how can this explode? That’s how heavily the wage pages of those sitting in Antrel and Germany are getting damaged that they come up with any nonsense that’s what you seen in you seen in your system and they said these systems will explode and create mayhem, my god the whole house in ground should have been blown up by now because they all use the same copper wire. They are relying on the fear the houses on the pent houses for half a million is going down the bin these cannot be paid because the governments don’t pay for their jobs because they cannot create enough mayhem, so next time somebody tells you this system can explode just show them this can they that the copper in their house should explode every day what did you say?<br>凯：你能引爆这个线圈吗？ 这就是这个系统，它怎么爆炸，这就是在德国和安特普的网站怎么遭到严重的损害，他们完全没来由的攻击，这线圈就是你在系统中看到的，他们说这些系统会爆炸造成恐慌，我的天，这整个房子都会被夷为平地，因为他们都在用同样的铜线，他们基于恐惧，将房子封锁，把钱放入地下室，他们不是被付薪水的，因为政府不会为他们的工作付薪水，因为他们还不足以创造足够的恐慌，下一次如果有人说这个系统会爆炸，展示给他们看这个线圈，难道你房子里的铜线每天都在爆炸吗？你在说什么？<br>[Devek]: Mr. Keshe Devek here I would like to add to that, I would like to show something later on but just to add now but if rarely it’s the case that it explode I would have exploded a few times already<br>戴夫：凯史先生，我想要加上一些，我想以后展示，但现在要加上，它极少会爆炸，不然我已经爆炸几次了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: how come you getting them or you are living on them?<br>凯史：那你是在吃它还是住在它上面？</p>
<p>[Devek]: I dont know I might see doing a lot of different things with them I touching them, moving them around connecting them in sometimes in certain cases wrongly and there no explosion<br>戴夫：我不知道，我做过很多不同的事情，我触碰他们，移动他们，连接他们，在某些情况下还是错误的连接，都没有爆炸<br>[Mr. Keshe]: no but this is what there are putting out<br>凯：不，这是他们发消息上面的<br>[Devek]: Correct this is what I am saying If…<br>戴夫：是的，这就是我要说的…<br>[Mr. Keshe]: If we have a very beautifulsaying firstly, we say they have nothing they got nothing left in the top now they are scratching the bottom of the pot<br>凯：我们有一个很好的说法，我们会说他们不会得到什么，不会有什么收获，他们正在抓一些皮毛…<br>[Devek]: yeah very soon they will be a whole at the bottom of the pot that’s why I am saying if that is the case if realty is the case it would have exploded a long time ago but I am still here.<br>戴夫：是的，很快他们将远远落在后面，这就是为什么我说的这种情况如果是真的，我很早以前就被炸掉了，但我现在还在这里。<br>[Rick]; I have got a video that is 2 minutes that I could show that is a great example of what you talking about there and it’s in  a foreign language pardon me<br>瑞克：我这里有一个2分钟的视屏，我能展示一下，这是一个你们谈论的很好的例子，<br>是外国语言。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Can you show it<br>凯：你能展示一下吗？<br>[Rick]; yeah just a second here<br>瑞克：是，等一下<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No this is what we are saying that’s what they say this is the way they are paid the problem is up to now they could try as I said they poison me and Caroline they blew our car up the police of the Belgium paid for us to be shot on the motorway they came to the house to shoot with 7 officers now they get nowhere the paid wages has to stop now you see what is coming up we don’t have the voice. So now they go to the bottom of the pit. Are you redoing it?<br>凯：不，这就是我们所说的，那是他们说的，这就是他们被支付报酬的方式，问题是现在他们可以继续试一下，就像我说的，他们毒害我和卡洛琳，炸毁我的车，比利时警方悬赏，在高速公路上我们被人射击，他们来到房里射击7个办公人员，现在他们无处可去，报酬也停止了，现在你看发生什么？我们听不见。所以他们深陷其中不能自拔，你是要重新做一下吗？<br>[Rick]: yes just a second there<br>瑞克：是的，等一下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: So what we want to see exactly what it is about the now and people’s ignorance and fear and that’s what we said what we showed last week that’s what they have to do to get their wages paid.<br>凯：这就是真实发生的，人们无知和恐惧，这就是我们在上周所说的和展示的。这就是他们必须做的以此得到薪水。<br>[Rick]: This is from Austria and his name is Olav and he speaking in I guess Austrian so we don’t hear while I don’t understand what he is saying but if you look at the video I think we will understand<br>瑞克：这是来自澳大利亚，他的名字是奥拉夫，他用澳大利亚语言讲话，所以我们听不懂他说的如果我们看视屏的话，<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Devek is here he can translate<br>凯：好的，他在这里我们能够翻译<br>[Rick]; sure we could do that, the story just gets the gist of what’s going on its kind of acute, so the setup here is that he is getting ready to plug his, plug in his home made Magrav unit for the first that’s why he got his safety glasses on and it’s like he has this idea he got the time and he is ready for testing now he still looking a little apprehensive<br>瑞克：当然，我们能这样做。只能理解里面的主要意思，有些敏感，这个装置他正在准备插入他的磁引力场装置，是第一次， （凯：我也看见他在用玻璃），这是他的想法，他正准备测试，他看起来有些忧虑。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It’s like he is going execution<br>凯：他看起来像是去行刑的。<br>[Rick]; well maybe he was already told this from the bad guys who talk, I think anybody has an event that makes something for the first time, I always put my safety glasses on<br>瑞克：可能他已经被那些别有用心的人告知有些不好的事情，我认为任何人第一次做什么事情都会遇到些什么，我总是把我的安全玻璃戴上。<br>[Mr. Keshe]:  I tell you something Let me explain to you something when this guy is finished we are doing.<br>凯:我来告诉你一些事情，我来解释一下我们在做什么，当这家伙做完后<br>[Rick]: So his first problem the plug wasn’t high enough so we get the chair<br>瑞克：他的问题是他的插头不够高，所以拿了一个椅子 </p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]; Keep your fingers crossed. People are making in every way of life<br>凯史：祝他好运，人们在探索生活的各种方式<br>[Rick]: Each one is unique and in completely different it’s amazing how many different structures it’s the single concepts that every single one different. The first step is plugged it in he doesn’t have plug on it he has plugged it in.<br>瑞克：每一个都是唯一的，完全不同的，是神奇的，这么多不同的结构，这是基本的理念：每一个都是唯一。第一步是插上去，他插上去了<br>[Mr. Keshe]: He has got on floor to speaker or the light<br>凯：他快屏气凝声了<br>[Rick]: He breathes a sigh of relief he is smiling takes the glasses off and he is obviously quite happy and satisfied<br>瑞克：他长舒一口气，笑起来，拿下玻璃罩，很明显他很高兴，很满足<br>[Devek]: The video speaks for itself Mr. Keshe I think I couldn’t hear a word it’s just bad recording I don’t know<br>戴夫：这个视屏在自言自语，凯史先生，我简直听不见一句话，糟糕的视屏<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yeah but it shows people are taking the position and they have made a difference, now I give you a tip, give you a very good tip you have seen these all flat with systems try to make them the same as a space technology turn them 90 degrees and put the gravitational in the horizontal position you will see the power of your system will increase.<br>凯：是的，但这展示出人们正在一步步取得进展，做出改变。现在我给你们一个提示，很好的一个提示，你们看到过这些平的线圈，试着将他们做成用在太空的技术，转成90度，使引力圈成水平状态，你会看见你的系统能量在增强。<br>[Rick]: Like this one you mean?<br>瑞克：像这样吗？ </p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]; you have seen it with Ali and he shows us his picture, yes but yes exactly that’s how it should be if you can do this. You see when you use straps like this you have to nano coat the straps do not put even the plastic you put it on try to nano coat you can’t put the matter coming in touch with the gans. Everything here you have to nano coated<br>凯：你看见阿里向我们展示过，是的，正是这样， ，如果你能做成这样的。如果你用这样的带子，你必须给这个带子纳米涂层，即使是塑料也要纳米涂层，你不能把物质态的东西带进来使之与甘斯接触。这里所有的东西都要进行纳米涂层。<br>[Rick]: It shows the level string thing here so<br>瑞克：这展示了这种使之固定的结构<br>[Mr, Keshe]: Let me tell you what it is I am trying to negotiate hopefully I will confirm it in the coming time. One of the biggest hotels in the world we trying to save them huge amounts of energy by placing these units in the hotels, it’s been tested so the biggest cost for hotels after the wages is electricity. Electric current bills is back breaking for the hotels and now with this technology they can reduce is by 50-100%. We announce the name of the hotel when we finish the work it’s one of the leading hotels in the world. We are prepared we are preparing to input free systems into the whole hotel that it shows the technology works and how much they can save. There is a very very big point and I keep on going on it, I have seen a lot of people especially people who are there to just to get fame on the back of the Keshe foundation what they don’t see what they aredoing it if you have built the unit.<br>凯：让我来告诉你这是什么。我正在很真诚的进行协商，很快就能确认出来。世界上最大的一个酒店，我们试图节省他们的能量消耗，通过放置这些装置，这是经过测试的，对于酒店来说最大的开销除了工资就是电费了。电力账单削弱酒店的预算能力，如果运用我们这项科技他们能够节省50%—100%。当我们完成这些工作后，我们会公开酒店的名字。它是世界上处于前沿的酒店。我们准备将这些系统植入酒店中，这将展示技术的效果，以及他们节省的能源。有很大很大的一点，我一直不断在重复，我看见大量的人，尤其是那些在凯史基金会的支持下获得名声的人，他们有不明白他们所做的，如果你建造了这样的装置，<br> Where you put, can you share my screen please if you built the unit here and you have seen a lot of people connected to a power and they put some load on it here and now they put some load here and then they put their metre here and then the whole of the house is behind it till the government metre. Your public metre and they say oh this does not read anything here it doesn’t do, our foolish friend you have seen the work of the plasma 129 the more demand  goes the one which is asking for more. These units are feeding all the energy here of course you will not see any reading as the others have done look at your public meeting reading at this point because here you are part of the structure here the flow of the current is different than at the point through your metre so what you have your meter reading counts not what you put on there to show it doesn’t work because it means you haven’t understood. So those of you who are putting metres on the table and putting the load and you say  you see only 5 or 10% because the rest of the body is taking the energy in the house, your meter counts even at you meter it’s still feeding more into the grid those of you who are doing these tests understand what you are doing exactly how you are doing if you run this side of the test long enough you can connect this side any of the equipment dishwasher whatever to a sink earth it and put a light or a load on one. Whatever you use here is totally free. So after a while when you move your system up you can take energy from any system which you have set.<br>凯：你所放的地方，能分享我的屏幕吗？如果你建造了这个单元，我看见很多人将其连接到一个电源 ，并放一些负载在这里，还有电表， ，然后后面是政府的电网 ，公共电网，并说，哦，这个米表没有读数 ，我的愚蠢的朋友啊，你们看见过129等离子体的运行，要求的更多，控制就更多 （上面黄框），这个单元把能量都供应在这里 ，所以你就看不到读数，当其他人做好，看你的电网读数，你也看不到读数，因为这是你是整个结构的一部分 ，而这边电网的电流是与你的米表不同的，你放在这里的米表的读数并不是表示它不工作 ，只是意味着你并不理解。那些人把米表放在桌子上，再放上负载，说只有5-10%的节省，因为这一部分正在吸取房子里的能量 （黄色部分），你的房子的电表正在给电网供能 ，正在做这些测试的人要理解你正在做以及怎样做，如果你使测试的效果足够长 （笔所指），你能把这个设备的一边如洗碗机或其他连接到水槽到地线，再把一个灯或者负载放在上面 （中间的线），不管这个负载是什么，它都将是免费的。过后当你移走你的系统，你就能从你设置好的系统中取得能量。<br>These meters you are putting these meters say 5 or 10% reduction is means you have an understood what about the rest of the building is your meter sitting here then we talk but if you system is sitting here we have to take we done that in the group with the Iranian officials who took the samples and they have seen it. So you’re as we seen people who report reduction on the meter bill reading that’s where is comes because this interface at the meter to the high power because it comes in different rate than what you consume it creates a blockage it creates a power that it delivers most of the energy at this point so, you read your meter don’t worry about meter you put on the table to discredit yourself your lack of understanding intelligence and that’s why we see people now putting the metre readings on we have seen the 0 readings since September on one meter and if you use the new structure which we have taught you as part of the supply you reach the 0 condition or near more than 50% whatever much faster it need time to work, understand, is somebody online?<br>凯：如果这里的米表显示有5-10%的节省 ，那么这剩下的部分呢 ？如果你把米表设置在这里 ，我们再说吧。如果你的系统在这里 ，就要拿走。与伊朗官员的合作结束了，他们拿走了样本，他们已经看过了。我们看见人们报告的所减少的电表账单读数，这就是它如何来的。电表的接口处于高电压，它与你所消耗的电流在不同的频率中 ，在这创造一种屏障 ，一种能量 ，它传送大部分能量到这里来 ，所以你读房子的电表，不要在乎你放在桌上的米表，别让它影响你的判断，这就是我们看见人们把他们的电表读数展示出来，自从9月份看见是0读数，如果你用我们交给你的新的结构，作为你供能的一部分，你就会达到0消耗，或者50%的节省，更快，但需要时间自适应。明白吗，有人在线吗？</p>
<p>[Devek]; yes Mr. Keshe about to ask may I add something that I just saw, Devek here.<br>戴夫：是的，凯史先生，我想要再提一些事情，我是戴夫<br>[Mr. Keshe]; yes Devek<br>凯：好<br>[Devek]: I made a very interesting observation today which I would like to ask for your advice<br>戴夫：我刚观察到一个有趣的现象，我想要征求你的意见。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; can you tell to our people where you are from<br>凯：你能告诉我们你来自哪里？<br>[Devek]; Singapore, okay I made a very interesting observation today and I would like to ask on your advice on this because I believe this will clear up a lot of things for a lot of people who media  their own stacker units. Okay I’ll just quickly share the screen when I first constructed the<br>戴夫：新加坡。我观察到一个有趣的现象，我想要征求你的意见。我相信这会给很多连接他们磁引力场装置的人解决心中的疑惑。好，我会很快分享屏幕，我首先建构了…</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: wait wait wait, Rick has to allow you to share the screen<br>凯：等一下，瑞克来分享你的视屏<br>[Devek]; Okay, one moment, one moment share screen share ok when I first made my stacker unit this is back in November what I did was I added a little bit of a an extension cord to the wires that are running to plug from the socket as well as the wires running from the power strip behind the Magrav student because it was a little bit difficult to strip the insulation around the 3 wires so what I noticed today because I wanted to see how far the nano coating has propagated through these wires I removed these wires and I noticed that the nano coating has actually propagated in a very interesting way but only through the extension wires so for example on the right hand side we see over here this was the path that was connected to the stacker it is nano coated but although here were the extension was twisted on to the main wire coming from the plug this was not nano coated<br>戴夫：好，等一下，分享视屏， ，当我第一次制造我的能量层单元时，在11月份，加长了用来插在插座上的以及磁引力装置后电源线的电线，因为很难剥光这三条电线的绝缘皮，我今天注意到，因为我想知道纳米涂层通过这些电线繁殖都多快，于是我拿走这些线，我注意到实际上纳米涂层以一种很有趣的方式在扩展，它只是通过延长的线在扩展，比如，在右边这是连接能量层的地方，被纳米涂层 ，但这里被扭结在一起的连接到主源线的插入的线尽管是延长的，但没有被纳米涂层 。</p>
<p>so what I did next is I stripped back the wire which is the extension wire to see how much of it was nano coated so the majority of it over here was seen to be nano coated but at the part just before where I twisted it on to the other wire that was where the nano coating stops this was for the live wire I noticed so next thing I did was that I stripped back the neutral wire which you see on top and where the green arrow is pointing there is a very clear demarcation where the nano coating stops so what I have understood from this is that yes the nano coating propagates but something I did over here is preventing the nano coating from going through the rest of the system so I suspected the same thing happened on the load side as well so I took a look so this a close up view of the 2 wires you can see where the nano coating has stopped it’s very very clear. So I look at the load side this where I tested the wires on there was no nano coating over there so stripped the wires out and the same thing had happened. For the life wire the nano coating had progressed almost all, it had progressed all the way up to where I had twisted the wire on and for the neutral wire where came off of the capacitor and went to the neutral wire on the power strip the nano coating had only progressed maybe about a quarter of the way through the wire and it stops where the green arrow is over here. So Mr. Keshe why is it happening like that?<br>戴夫：所以我接下来做的是我把延长线的绝缘皮都剥下来，看看纳米涂层的效果， ，这里大部分都被纳米涂层，只有在这个与其他线用来连接的缠绕的部分，纳米涂层停下来了 ，我注意到这是火线，接下来我把中间的线的皮剥下来，屏幕上面的，有一个绿色的箭头表示纳米涂层终止的地方 ，我从这个现象明白了纳米涂层能够这样不断延伸，但是我在这里做的却在阻止纳米涂层的进行，于是我猜测同样的事情发生在负载的一端，这是2根线清晰的照片 ，你能看见纳米涂层在那里停止下来，很清楚，看负载的一端， 这就是我连接线的地方，那里没有纳米涂层，就把塑料皮去除了，同样的事情发生了 ，在火线上纳米涂层几乎全部涂层了，一直到我缠绕线圈的地方，连接到能源带中间的绿线纳米涂层好像只进行到四分之一，在绿色的箭头那里停止下来，所以，凯史先生，为什么发生这样的事？</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: In time the whole lot will be nano coated. In time all your wires will be nano coated the only thing is as you, as we explain in the battery plasma today the nano coating needs confinement to be attach tool and the cover creates that and if you leave it long  enough, if you just put a plastic cover where over where the interfaces between your wires where there no nano coated come back in few weeks it will be nano coated.<br>凯：迟早，整根线都会被纳米涂层，迟早，你所有的线都会被纳米涂层，有一件事是，就像我们今天在等离子体电池中所讲的，纳米涂层需要一个束缚从而成为一种附着物，这覆盖就创造了这种情形；如果你就让它们这样，如果你把塑料就覆盖在线与线之间没有纳米涂层的接口处，几个星期，纳米涂层就会出现。<br>[Devek]: You mean this one?<br>戴夫：你是指这个？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yes just cover it with a piece of plastic and then come back and let it snow<br>凯：是的，用一片塑料覆盖住，然后让它自己慢慢涂层<br>[Devek]: Because this was initially covered with the electrical insulation tape and …<br>戴夫：这个最初是被绝缘材料覆盖的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: No cover it with the plastic, cover it… even these junction in the long run will become nano coated.<br>凯：用塑料覆盖，甚至这个接合处在长时间内也会被纳米涂层的。<br>[Devek]: Right okay<br>戴夫：好</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: Because something in the long run becomes nano coated we see this before but as we set now you have proof that what we said that the wires in time in the whole house will be nano coated and then you find out you don’t even need to connect to the power supply because what does this nano coating you just showed does. Nano coating means absorbing all the energy so when I look at your black and the brown side in the middle it’s not fully done yet it looks not really fully black, it takes time to really fully black and it depends how much power you put on the load side and this would change the situation that now the nano coating will absorb all the energy as they go across the room and the house as they go to the pipe. And then the energy flips the point that you can and you will reach a point of supplying the house without any power supply we have seen this with 2 houses now. The more you load on the load side of your unit the more the faster you create this condition this is the process which I said when a large number of people use these units you have shown it clearly the nano coating will go to the power stations and what will close down then nuclear power stations because is atomic structure plasma and the only place that will interfere with is a plasma in a nano layers in the nuclear power stations<br>凯史：因为长期看这些都会被纳米涂层，我们以前看过这样的，就像我们所说的，现在你能证明我们所说的，在房间里的线路迟早会被纳米涂层，然后你就会发现你根本不需要连接到能量单元，因为这个纳米涂层就能展示自己所做的，因为纳米涂层吸收所有的能量，当我看你的黑色的棕色线时，它还没有完全完成，不是真的全黑 ，它需要时间变成全黑，这取决于你把多少能量放在负载端，这就会改变这种情形，纳米涂层会吸收所有的能量，在它所经过的路径上，房间里，管子里。然后能量会翻转到一点，你能达到的一点：不需要能量供应就能维持房间的自运转，我们已经看到2个房间是这样的。你在你的装置的负载端放置的负载越多，创造这种环境就会越快，这就是我所说的过程，大量的人在使用这些装置，你能够清楚的展示出，纳米涂层会进入到国家的电网中，电网会关闭，核电站会关闭，因为这是原子结构的等离子体，唯一能够起干扰作用的是在纳米层中的等离子体，在核电站中的等离子体。</p>
<p>[Rick]: Is it also how it was twisted round as in it…<br>瑞克：这也是它如何在里面被缠绕的</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]: It doesn’t make any difference it does not. The twisting changes a little because you change the environment but at the end the nano coating will carry on true.<br>凯：这不会有影响，不会，这种缠绕改变一点点，因为你改变了环境，但在纳米涂层的末端会继续<br>[Devek]: okay right now I haveactually removed these little extension wires and I have connected the wires directly from the, to the stacker and from the power strip to the stacker as well it’s now a direct connection. Thank you Mr. Keshe<br>戴夫：好，我已经移除这些延长的线，我把线直接连上能量层，连上电源，现在是直接的连接。谢谢你。凯史先生。</p>
<p>[Mr. Keshe]; You are welcome but this is what we said because a lot of people have had a question risen by a nuclear physicist, you know Mr. Keshe this what you telling us is doesn’t make sense because we all will use the nuclear reactor is for your creating a steam and going through the power system and that’s all it does. I said one thing you don’t understand is that this system will go and nano coated the whole power station in time. With the coal we stop with nuclear we cannot stop because then it goes in the flooding and then the whole structure is been nano coated, is a huge flow of energy which will change everything in its own way.<br>凯：不客气，这正是我想要说的，许多人都会问一个问题，这是一个核物理学家提出来的：你知道吗，凯史先生，你告诉我们的没有道理啊，我们都用核反应堆，你在用蒸汽，再用能量系统，就是这些了。我说，你们还没有明白一件事，迟早将会使整个电力站纳米涂层化，用纳米涂层我们就不需要核电站，我们不能停下来，这将如洪水般来临，这整个结构将会被纳米涂层化，这会是一个巨大的能量流，这将会以它自己的方式改变所有的事情。<br>[Devek]: I would just like to say for those who have been posting videos that nano coating cannot occur the evidence is right here it’s very very clear for all of us to see so please go and re-check the system that you built make sure you have followed the instructions and when you connect it up give it time, give it sufficient load like what Mr. Keshe says and with time you will see the nano coating propagate. Thank you Mr. Keshe<br>戴夫：我想说的是那些把视屏放在网上的人，如果纳米涂层不能够发生，原因很明显，非常清楚，请重新检查你所建的系统，确保你遵循了指示，当你连上的时候，多给一点时间，给它充足的负载，就像凯史先生所说的，随着时间的推移，纳米涂层会自我扩展。谢谢你，凯史先生。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; you are welcome this is when put information out we try to be as precise as possible and those who go and show things does not work because they don’t do it their way and they been paid to do. We are getting more and more directed to all the problems of the Keshe foundation comes in one country from one place with the banks with everything else with the companies and we literally fight case by case in the court and the judges are throwing everything out for against these people. And these are paid don’t forget for 10 years they managed to close the foundation and keep us under control and its paid very well, half a million house for a man who has no food to eat is a lot of money. These people get paid heavily now you are doing it you don’t need to do it and whatever anybody puts opposite to what the foundation go and test it yourself and plan it. We warned the government the Swiss government has listen to our warning very clearly they have setup to close down the nuclear power stations because when Italians use these systems heavily Swiss power stations and French nuclear power stations are at high risk, we are warning both nations world governments the French government relies heavily on nuclear industry,85% of the national power  is created from nuclear they have to create that position because the whole thing goes because this is how EU plan control of EU in not EU countries<br>凯：不客气，当张贴信息出来时，我们会尽量确保精确，那些展示系统不能工作的人，因为他们并没有按那样的方式做，他们是被人支付报酬的。我们越来越面对针对凯史基金会的问题，这些问题都来自一个国家的一个地方，有银行的，政府的，公司的；我们事实上在法庭上面对面的反驳，争取我们的权利，法官也在竭尽全力反对这些人。这些被付酬劳的人别忘记10年来他们试图关闭基金会，想把我们置于控制之下，他们被付很高的报酬，50万对一个没有食物吃的人来说是很大一笔钱，这些人被付很高的报酬，现在你正在做，你没有必要做，任何反对基金会运行的人，自己去测试一下这些系统。我们警告过政府，瑞士政府听从了这些警告，他们关闭了核电站，因为当意大利加快使用这些系统时，瑞士和法国原子能机构就面临很大的风险，我们都警告过这两个国家和政府，法国政府很依赖于核能，国家85%的能源来自于核能，他们不得不重新实现那样的功能状态，因为现在整个趋势就是这样的。因为是欧盟在计划与控制，而不是欧盟的国家。</p>
<p>because France is a contour of supply to UK to Germany to France to Belgium to Holland to Spain with the nuclear and if there is a turmoil in the oil industry they will always rely on the French nuclear reactor and now the leg is taken off. I have a very good for the Belgian nuclear industry and those and those who reported them from Antrel if the Belgian government tries to accept and deliver all the power, nuclear what do you call this Magrav systems and the clouding carries on of the nano coating all the cracks in the nuclear power stations especially in the structures can have a big surprise for the nation because there are millions of cracks in the power stations, nuclear power stations in Belgium this should be by international be closed down. The nano coating travels on the strength of where it can change or give not by force and it always finds a path to change to make it easier, this is why at your power point you find where they change gans. You have a higher power on the other side and this side is lower power so in nano coat and take the power on here not on there and then when it works on the eddy currents which is what we call gravitational field in electrical movement then you will find out the power stations get nano coated, they pull the nano coating towards them. In electrical science those of you who are wiser than me and study electrical currents in electrical, what do you call it electronics and electrical power systems as such you have a 2 way flow system what goes with your current and one which is opposition which is eddy currents which is the reversal position. In English in the world of plasma one is magnetic which is the current you put to yourself and the eddy current is the gravitational of the power station so gravitational is always the strong way that’s why you pull the nano coating down the power lines. This is the way the structure works you will be surprised when we will put out the medical unit. Is Renon still online or has disappeared yet?<br>凯：因为法国给英国供核能，给德国，比利时，荷兰，西班牙供核能，如果在石油工业上有什么动荡，他们总会依赖于法国的核反应堆，现在这只腿也被拿走了。我有一个很好的消息给比利时原子能工业以及那些在安特普发布报告他们消息的人，如果接受并应用这些磁引力场装置，在纳米涂层的作用下，所有核电站尤其是这个结构中的缝隙都会有一个惊喜的效果，因为在核电站里有上百万个裂缝，在国际机构的约束下这些核电站会被关闭，纳米涂层是在一个强度上运行中，在这个强度上它的改变与给予不是靠强制力，它总能找到一个途径进行轻松的改变，这就是为什么你在你的插座接口处看到改变。在那边你有很高的能源频率，在这边你有比较低的能量频率，所以纳米涂层在这里吸取能量，而不是在那里，然后它以涡流的形式运作，这既是我们说的在电流中的引力场，然后你就发现核电站被纳米涂层，它们将纳米涂层拉向它们。在电力学中，你们很多都比我更聪明，在研究比如电流，电子学，电力系统，有2中电流运动方式，其中一个是反向的，是涡流形式，处于反转的位置。在英语中，在等离子体世界中，一种是磁力，也就是你将方向指向外部的电流，还有就是涡流，也就是核电站中的引力，引力总是一种很强的形式，这就是为何你将纳米涂层拉向自己的电源路线上，这就是这个结构工作的原理。如果我们释放医疗单元，你们也会很惊讶的。雷农在线吗？<br>[Renon]: I am here Mr. Keshe<br>雷农：我在。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Good morning yourself Renon how are you?<br>凯：早上好。<br>[Renon]: Yes sir good day<br>雷农：早。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: How is medical unit can we show it soon?<br>凯：医疗装置怎么样了，能展示一下吗？<br>[Renon]: Yes I just doing the nano coating by fire that coils are ready that the structure is still in the assembly stage but we have already the first, I think we are going to accomplish this by tomorrow<br>雷农：是的，我刚用火烧法进行纳米涂层，线圈已经准备好了，整个结构还在组装阶段，但第一步已经完成了，我认为我们在明天可以完成。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay if you can accomplish it by tomorrow can you give us a guarantee it will be ready by Sunday?<br>凯：好，如果你在明天完成，你能给我一个保证在星期天能够准备好吗？<br>[Renon]: This Sunday yes sir we can have that<br>雷农：这个星期天，好的，我们能做好<br>[Mr. Keshe]; with all the blueprints ready for it?<br>凯：还有所有的蓝图？<br>[Renon]: the, yes they are basic blueprints which is the basic drawings I can have the …<br>雷农：是的，基本的蓝图，基本的图画，我能…..<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You can give us that assurance that it will be ready by Sunday with the drawings. You can call on Robert to help you in the background.<br>凯：你能向我们保证在星期天能够准备好这些图画吗？你能叫罗伯特在后台帮你。<br>[Renon]: Yes no problems with the drawings I have already started the drawings last Tuesday for the batteries and everything<br>雷农：好的，没问题，这些图画。我已经在上个星期二开始绘制这些图画了，如电池还有其他。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: now we change the game is it good for you if we announce the Tuesday this coming Tuesday instead of afternoon international session we call the Tuesday the health unit day for blueprint and we show internationally public as a full day?<br>凯史：好。现在我们改变了游戏规则。这是好消息。我们会在下个星期二宣布，而不是下午的国际教学，我们就叫做星期二医疗单元日，我们一整天在国际教学中展示出来？<br>[Renon]: We can do that sir, then unit will be accomplished and but we have, we will be, we need to test it, its  already…<br>雷农：我们能做到，先生，这个装置会被完成，我们要，我们需要对它测试，它已经….<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We don’t need to test it I already tested it, you just…<br>凯：我们不需要测试，我们已经测试过了，你只需要<br>[Renon]: Okay sir. It will be done by Sunday sir<br>雷农：好的，先生。星期天完成，先生。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay Vince can we guarantee the Tuesday as a health public day blue print?<br>凯：文斯，我们能将保证将星期二作为蓝图的健康公众日？<br>[Rick]: On the various channels sure<br>瑞克：有很多办法实现，当然。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Vince is that what you can do?<br>凯：文斯在那吗，你能做什么？<br>[Vince]: Yes we are working very hard for that goal<br>文斯：是的，我们为那个目标加倍努力。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; so we are now, we bring it from 11th forward to next Tuesday because we usually do the health on Tuesdays<br>凯：那么我们现在把它移到下个星期二，因为我们一般在星期二做医疗教学。<br>[Renon]: Okay sir no problem<br>雷农：好的，没问题。<br>[Rick]: Did you say that would be all day Mr. Keshe or will just be for that<br>瑞克：你是说是全天，凯史先生？或者只是<br>[Mr. Keshe]: all day we run, it will be run directly live presentation from Philippine they will show the system unlike the last time because the systems are nowhere near from part of the world we are not so we rely on Renon and his team to have the systems and we explain and then move straight to it from points of the world there will show the systems and I will explain the uses of them, is that ok with you Renon?<br>凯：全天。将会从网上在菲律宾展示全过程。他们会展示这个系统，不像上一次，因为系统不在附近，所以我们依赖雷农和他的团队制造这个系统，而我们来解释，然后发布给全世界，将会展示系统，我来解释怎么使用。这样可以吗？雷农<br>[Renon]: Yes sir， that is okay with me we will just prepare the station.<br>雷农：好的，这样没问题，我们准备这个展示。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: The reason we are doing this we literally off lagging the pharmaceutical if they want to block anything for the 11th and it runs very fast through this. I told you that there will be no guarantee that we will do it on the 11th now we do it on the 26th of January, so we have the job where the Magrav units the governments will give them public on 26th of November if I am correct now on the 26th of January we release the health. Is that okay with the people?<br>凯：我们这样做的原因是，我们事实上把制药行业拉下了台，如果他们想要在11号阻止什么，而进程会更快。我告诉过，我们不会保证在11号做，我们会在1月26号做，我们在11月26号把磁引力场装置交给了政府，如果我没记错的话，现在我们在1月26号释放健康装置。这样可以吗，各位？<br>[Rick]: Sure of course absolutely 26th of January Vince how will you live<br>瑞克：好的，1月26号，文斯，你怎样<br>[Vince]: Sorry say it again.<br>文斯：再说一遍。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Is the 26th Tuesday okay for you whole day 9 o’clock we start usual at 10 o’clock Central European time worldwide we go as long as it takes to this system, application implication what it got to be done and the way it is produced reasons its reduced and the way it is set. Is that okay with you? Renon can you setup such a structure for us to do the presentation<br>凯：26号，星期二，整天的教学，9点，中欧时间是10点，我们尽可能长时间释放解释这个系统，它的应用，它的含义，这必须完成，它制作的方式，它的工作原理，设置的方式。没问题吧，雷农？你能准备一下这个结构，做一下准备。<br>[Renon]: I can will be in the other lab so we set it up there to be in the videos so we can show it.<br>雷农：好的。我能在另一个实验室设计它们，会在视屏中展示。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: All the new batteries systems which go on Tuesday as a back-up energy as discussed.<br>凯：所有的新式电池系统会在星期二展示出来，作为能量的后备补给，就如我们所讨论的。<br>[Renon]: Yes sir it’s for that and then the other one for that.<br>雷农：好的，会准备好，还有另一个<br>[Rick]: Will you have good bandwidth as well Renon that’s important…<br>瑞克：你会有一个更好的网络带宽吗，这是很重要的<br>[Renon]: I believe with the bigger bandwidth<br>雷农：我相信会有一个更大的带宽<br>[Rick]: Excellent<br>瑞克：很好<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much for your help Renon that is fantastic<br>凯：感谢你所做的，雷农，这很棒<br>[Renon]: Thank you so much.<br>雷农：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We will show the working of the first cancer unit for reversal of cancer on 26 we advise and such processes it’s for you to test. We release the system and instead of going to the rabbit we ask people who like to test it. These are the systems we already know we are not putting something on the table which is different but we show the structure<br>凯：我们将会在26号展示第一个治疗癌症的装置的工作原理，然后你们来测试。我们释放这个系统，为避免不必要的麻烦，我们要求人们来测试。这些系统是我们已经知道的，我们不是把什么特别的东西放在桌子上，我们展示这个结构<br>[Rick]: can we make it part of the, sorry part of the blueprint teaching or it won’t be the international …<br>瑞克：我们能制作蓝图教学的一部分吗？这就不会<br>[Mr. Keshe]: we open the blueprint teaching but to have to be a big teaching and food blueprint teaching because the same system can be used to feed. The same system can be used for people, but you have understand something very interesting when we speak about the food we discussed this before maybe we touch on it before we get on Tuesday you have to remember that your body continuously get supplied with energy you eat every few hours you put something in your mouth when you used the gans system it’s the same process you have to take what is not needed and out what is needed you will found out your appetite will diminish because now you get most of the, you change that 20% of the food by intake of the air and the food into the system and you will find out for you to go to big toilet will change too, you will not go to piss that much you will not go to toilet maybe 3,4,5 days because there is no residue anymore the body takes what it needs and then they will change it’s the same as what we just told you and it got confirmed how the bile is getting nano coated. We are making the body of the mad ready for the space and in that process we take hunger out of the structure control of what they think the control have us.<br>凯：我们公开蓝图教学，这也是食物蓝图教学，因为都是用一样的系统来供给的。这是一样的系统用在人们身上，但你要理解一个很有趣的事情，我们谈论食物时，我们以前讨论过，可能我们会在星期二之前解释清楚，你要明白你的身体持续的得到能量的供给，你每几个小时就吃饭，把东西放在嘴里，当你使用甘斯系统时，也是一样的过程，你拿出不需要的，吸收需要的，你会发现你的胃口食欲在减少，因为你得到大部分的，你会改变你从空气与食物中摄入的能量的20%，你会发现你上厕所的方式也会改变，你不会频繁的去小便，可能3,4,5天上一次厕所，因为没有残留的东西了，身体只是吸取它所需要的，然后它们会改变。这就是我们刚才告诉你们的一样的道理，并得到确认，管线是如何被纳米涂层的，我们在为进入太空而重造人的身体，在这个过程中，我们将饥饿从控制的结构中拿走，这就是那些人想要控制我们的地方。<br>Because these units creates a dynamic magnetic gravitational field your body takes what it needs it creates no harm if it doesn’t need it, it doesn’t do when you walk when you sit billions of tons of radiation from all over the universe is going to through your body, you create different lumps and bumps every second no but it only takes what it needs this is what we do, we create the environment that body takes what it needs, banana whatever and we can make even a system that instead of going to the pub and spending god knows 30, 40 pounds for a drink just go to the system we can make enough for you to make you drunk but we only work on your sugar of your blood not on alcohol. So Tuesday we teach you how to feed and how to reverse every known disease to man especially viruses. We would like volunteers to test this system for diseases like Hepatises B diseases like AIDS and HIV we would to like what the governments to use this in Saudi Arabia for the peasant disease which comes from the camel and is killing a lot of people like flu as a virus. We give this as a gift to the nation of Saudi Arabia. We have a meeting setup in that respect in coming days. This goes as a simple system hopefully built by Alex and Benjamin to be given as a gift to the people of Keshe foundation of Sierra Leone which is suffering so much with E.coli and Ebola. You can put these put these units in the Water Rivers of the world and see the changing structure to save drinking water, what we deliver is the promise of the promise of the past be complete the promise.<br>凯：因为这些单元创造一个动态的磁引力场，你的身体只获取自己所需，如果没有需要就不会造成任何伤害，如果你行走在太空中，有来自宇宙上亿吨的辐射穿过你的身体，每秒你就会形成不同的肿块？不会，身体只接受它所需，这就是我们做的，我们创造一个环境能让身体只接受自己所需，香蕉，或其他，我们也能制造一个系统，你就不用去酒吧喝酒消费了，直接去系统就能让你获取你想要喝的，但供给你的能量饮料是建立在你的血糖水平上的，而不是酒精上的。所以在星期二，我们交给你们怎样供给自己，怎样逆转人类已知的所有疾病，尤其是病毒。我们需要志愿者来参与测试，用来测试乙肝，艾滋病。我们希望政府能够将它使用在沙特农民的身上的疾病中，这些疾病来自于骆驼，就像流感病毒一样杀死了大量的人，我们将这个系统作为一种礼物送给沙特。在接下来几天我们在这方面会有一个会议。希望阿历克斯和本杰明能够制作这样的简单装置作为送给塞拉利昂的凯史基金会，那里人正在遭受大肠杆菌和埃博拉病毒的折磨。你能把这些系统放在世界各地的河流中看改变其中的结构使其成为可以饮用的水源。我们所传达的是承诺，很久以前的承诺，要完成这种承诺的承诺。<br>Understand what is about to happen and work toward world peace. No child as of Tuesday should go hungry to bed if you are committed to the work of the Keshe foundation and no person should die or suffer from cancer if you its developed delivered correctly by you as the followers of the Keshe foundation. As we say the ball is in your court not ours but they will be said up to now we deliver the news in seen in the past few minutes. The systems for flight is getting tested from all point of space to reach the sky through the way we reach it. We are now working to lives in the backrooms the system sits in an open air ready for test it very much like the first Apollo on the launch pad of NASA in Florida this is you testing and getting ready for the operation I showed you in a new way to energize the system. I promise you in 2016 we will bring all the pressures to world peace and we deliver now we start the real pressure medical on one side energy already delivered as space getting tested openly and open spaces of pures of Canada I am sure the Swiss team will come up with theirs very soon. The only difference is we do not employ 1800 0people and we don’t have a laugh pad which now used as rental because it’s not used it failed in delivering to take man to space on the primary basis. What do you seen on the tent which is there is literally like a shuttle coming out of its safe but this is the structure of what will be the space ship as we promised. There is now need for you to develop this time we do it together among the worlds across the world at less than a few 100 dollars. Ali how much has the whole structure cost you to build?<br>凯：理解即将到来的，朝和平的方向努力。星期二后就不会有孩子带着饥饿入睡，如果你决定从事凯史基金会的相关工作，没有人会因为癌症而死亡，如果你作为凯史基金会的追随者正确的发展并传达它。就像我说的，下一步就看你们自己了，不是我们，我们已经传达了信息。飞行系统已经经过了测试，能够在我们的操控下从空间的各个方向飞到天空。我们不在密室里，我们在一个开放的环境下进行测试，很像在弗罗里达州美国宇航局发射阿波罗号一样，现在该你来测试了，准备好这个工作，我展示过以一个新的方法给这个系统供能，我承诺，在2016年会尽一切努力施加一切压力实现世界和平，现在我们真正开始施加压力，医疗装置就是其中之一，能量装置已经释放了，飞船已经公开测试了，以及在加拿大的户外进行了测试。我相信瑞士团队会很快带来消息。不同之处是我们没有雇佣18000个人，没有建设发射台，因为这种方式将人送上太空基本上是失败的，你在帐篷上看到的就很像一个梭子，但这个结构将会是宇宙飞船的结构，就像我们所承诺的。你需要去发展它，这一次世界各地的人们都联合起来一起做也不会超过几百美元。阿里，你建造的这个结构花了多少钱？<br>[Ali]: I would say about roughly 130, 40 dollars or something<br>阿里：大概130-140美元<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Canadian dollars<br>阿里：加拿大美元<br>[Ali]: Yeah<br>阿里：是的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It’s about 100 Euro. There is big difference between a 100 billion budget and 100 Euro budget and its done by you, you will deliver in time I will teach you slowly, slowly as our permanent now you are understood what was going on this morning what we taught this morning I showed you the way you can power it, everything is in a very nice blueprint handout. This is the most beautiful blueprint you ever understand these pages will go down the history, page by page you understand what we said in the teaching you understand how we have the total freedom.<br>凯：大概100欧元。在1000亿欧元预算与100欧元预算之间这是一个巨大的差别，而且这是你完成的，你将会迟早会发射成功，我会很慢的教你们，作为我们长期计划的一部分。现在你明白了今天早上我所讲的，我展示给你们供给系统的方式，所有这些都会以很清晰的蓝图呈现出来。这是你所理解的最美妙的蓝图，这些纸会被载入史册，一页一页你会明白我们所教的，你会明白你如何获得了完全的自由。<br>[Ali]: This is a great honour Mr. Keshe<br>阿里：这很伟大，凯史先生。<br>[Robert]: Mr. Keshe while we are still here.<br>罗伯特：凯史先生，我们还在这里。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Pardon?<br>凯：什么？<br>[Robert]: Robert Studdlefield here I am sorry I was just going to let you know I out a picture on Facebook to show how the wiring in your house becomes nano coated you can see it right by the plastic.<br>罗伯特：我，罗伯特，刚来，对不起，我刚去，你知道，在脸书上放了一个图片，去展示如何在你的房子里连接线，然后能被纳米涂层，你能看见在塑料的帮助下实现<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can you share the link with us live now?<br>凯：你能与我们分享衔接吗？<br>[Robert]: Yeah one moment<br>罗：好，等一下。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Is there any advertising in the background that it can cause problem?<br>凯：背景会有一些广告带来的问题吗？<br>[Robert]: No, it shouldn’t be I’ll double check before hand, maybe I’ll come back with it I will have to search for it I am sorry. It’s on there is you search Robert Studdlfield Rick mine is the picture with the horse maybe you can find it quicker than I can on my phone.<br>罗：不会。我会再检查一遍，可能我等下回来，我要去寻找一下，抱歉，它在那里，你就搜索Robert Studdlfield，瑞克，我的文件是画了一个马的，也许你能更快找到，这样我能连接上耳机。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: can I have some water please? Till he get his pictures so we see now another addition be very aware and understand, we just seen a lady who had been 2, 3 times with us. The lady who you spoke about her eyes at the beginning of this talk with Ali, thank you very much is the same lady as you seen in the picture showing her hands and face which is been directly inside the plasma zone. And you seen the changes she is reporting when we show the health system it’s the same condition we put you in a plasma zone. The blind shall we see and the deaf will hear you will see every disease will be reversed if the intention of the person receiving is to achieve to see would you like to share with us Rick did you manage to get it?<br>凯：能倒杯水给我吗？等他找到他的图片，我们另外说一下，请注意理解，我们刚才看见一位女士和我们分享视屏，在与阿里视屏的开始，这位女士谈到她的眼睛，也是这位女士在等离子体区域中展示自己的手和脸部，你看见了她所报告的变化；当我们展示医疗装置时，也是一样的状况，我们把你放在等离子体区域中，瞎子会变得看见，聋子会变得听见，你会看见所有的疾病都能得到逆转，只要这个人的意愿是想实现这样的结果，你愿意和我们一起分享吗，你能找到吗？<br>[Rick]: Yes, I just set up right now<br>瑞克：是的，我正在设置。<br>[Robert]: Yeah I put it on your page, I said I put it on your page, If you look closely you can see the bare wire by the plastic and then it’s getting quite black right around there too I think it is starting to come back out of the plastic I have had plugged in for quite a long time now.<br>罗：好，我把它放在你的页面上了，我说把它放在你的页面上了，如果你仔细看，你能看见带着塑料的线，它正变得很黑，我认为它应该快从塑料中出来了，我已经把它插上去够久了<br>[Rick]: is that the picture that we are actually showing or that’s…<br>瑞克：是那个图片吗？<br>[Robert]: No that’s its that’s it that’s so far that’s what I have posted since we are talking about it I figured I’d post one real quick I just talking with somebody else about it and had already taken the picture.<br>罗：是的，是的，就是我们谈话后我放上去的，我想我已经张贴上去了，我刚和其他人谈论过，我已经拿到图片了<br>[Rick]: Okay thank you<br>瑞克：好的，谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Please don’t wreck the house pull the wire to see if its nano coated<br>凯：把线拉出来时不要损坏房子，只为了看是否纳米涂层<br>[Robert]: No, no worries<br>罗：不会，别担心<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We see the change the change will come in a way we will do it we don’t do it but now but us bringing the full work the health application to next Tuesday please understand that what is about to happen I think you will be privileged we have one or two worlds scientist on Tuesday as well present with me I hope he can make it. We will bring some of the most eminent scientist from around the world to be present in that day if they can join us. These are people who work in a field of health internationally. So we have suddenly changed and we push through with the change the only thing is as I said is that it’s not us anymore, it’s all of us as humanity. Please consider to make as many as you can pens these are pen of peace give it to the soldiers instead of guns of killing and war. Make the pen and write peace with it, we need to do that because that the time that we can change we can bring the change we can enforce the change and we can push the change peace or power. You will find a lot of politicians will get on the bang wagon because it makes votes for them, let them do. We will announce as I said by July that we will decide on which person will be the next president of United States according to the peace plan offered to the nation.<br>凯：我们看到改变，改变正在来临，现在我们在星期二释放医疗装置的全部工作原理，请理解即将到来的，你们可能会很幸运我们会有一两个世界级科学家与我一起进行这次教学，我希望你们能听这次教学。我们把几位世界著名的科学家带来与我们一起分享星期二的教学，如果他们愿意加入我们的话。这是一些工作在国际医疗领域上的人。所以突然间我们改变了，我们将这种改变不断推进。唯一的是，就像我所说，这不再是我们，而是作为人类的整体的我们。请尽可能多的制造笔，这是和平之笔，送给士兵，交换枪支与战争，制造笔，实现和平，我们需要这样做，我们能改变，我们能带来改变，我们能实施改变，我们能推进改变，实现和平，改变力量。我们看见大量的政治家在宣传车上进行政治宣传，这能帮助他们拉选票，让他们做。我们会宣布，正如我所说，在7月份，我们会来决定美国下一任总统的人选，根据提他为这个国家提供的和平计划。</p>
<p> Not on the wars we will interfere directly on the plan of the most powerful nation of the world on the platform of peace with technology. We give a pen of peace to every soldier and one to the president don’t forget I was explaining this to someone before very recently and I repeat to understand how Keshe foundation affects the policy of the most nation on this planet, we have seen the request of his excellency president Obama for asking for the key which came and brought the shake hand and putting the cross the table the hand of peace and we achieved peace and you see the sanctions coming off. We helped the president in a very direct way we saw the senate putting opposition that they are going to wait for the peace process with Iran down. In the interview with Mike Harris and another interview in the united states I explain the simple thing and that was how can any senator in the senate any member of the senate to have to how long a house and member of the communities and whatever can object to 10 million between 2-20 million jobs which is going to be created out of the peace plan with Iran, you show me one member of senate that’s goes and said peace cannot be written because it couldn’t create jobs for my members of the what do you call it community and we saw the leader of the opposition signing peace with Iran and the following Monday after my talks because they understood. We help we interfere and we have a full knowledge of what we are interfering with it. The next president of United States will be elected on the peace platform not war. Who can deliver peace, the Keshe foundation is a matter of peace, Keshe space technology for peace will be elected we will make sure of that. That’s why we deliver everything in public very fast and if we can interfere that level and bring peace and prosperity to the Americans we can do with the rest of the world. Last time I put the hand of peace in the United States now I put the hand of peace collectively to the world leaders. American senators understood they had no ground to stand to oppose 10 million jobs in this high recession time and we saw the first announcement of Boeing agreeing and signing contract the way we set. Create hundreds and thousands of jobs for Americans.<br>凯：不是根据战争，我们将会在此项技术带来和平的基础上直接的介入到这个世界上最有权势的国家的政治进程中。我们分发笔给每一个士兵，还有一支笔给总统，别忘记，最近我向某个人解释过，我重复说，要理解凯史基金会是怎样影响这个星球上最有权势国家的政治的，我们看见了奥巴马阁下的请求，要求得到技术，这带来谈判桌上的和平性握手，我们实现了和平，你们看见（对伊朗）制裁被取消了，我们在以很直接的方式帮助总统，我们看见参议院提出反对议案，他们想要以一个和平的进程以使伊朗垮台，在与麦克哈里的会见中以及与其他人的见面中，我解释很简单明了，参议院的任何参议员或成员以及社团的人怎么能拒绝与伊朗签署和平协议所带来的2百万到2千万的工作机会，此前每个参议员都会说与不能与伊朗签署和平协议，因为这并不能为我的社区创造工作机会。我们看见原本反对的领袖与伊朗签署了和平协议，这是在我们谈话后下个星期一发生的，他们完全理解了。我们帮助，我们介入，我们在这方面有完全的知识。下一任的美国总统的选举将会建立在和平而非战争的基础上，谁能传达和平，因为凯史基金会是一个和平的实体，凯史太空科技是实现和平的科技，谁能与我们达成一致，谁就会被选上，我们很肯定这一点。这就是为什么我们在公众间快速的传播各种知识与技术，如果我们能在那个层面上介入，并给美国带来和平与繁荣的话，我们也能在世界其他地区实现这一点。上一次我把和平之手伸向美国，现在我把和平之手伸向其他世界领导人。美国参议员理解他们没有理由和基础去反对在这个大衰退环境下能创造1000万个工作的机会。我们看见波音公司表示同意的一个声明，表示会签署我们所设置的协议。为美国人创造数百上千的工作。<br>The others will follow the same make as many units as you can and give to every American soldier there are a lot of Veterans which listens to this program in US we know. Make one and give it to the soldiers you made you know what the suffering of war brought you, if you suffer if from any disease in Vietnam if you came back with a lot of problem from Iraq and Afghanistan if you come back and member of your family suffers from all sorts of problems in any of the zones in middle east with the wars which was financed by Vatican what they call the spring uprising use this systems to reverse the technology. We have used  it effectively person who is touched both by depleted nuclear war head and chemical effects of the war and is alive and we saved his life with it he decided to do it Brad would you like to come online and explain as you did before? Is Brad online? Is he asleep? Okay I can disclose this to you because Brad himself announced what happened to him in the American meeting last week. This is not a private no it’s a public knowledge, Brad was one of the close members of the Keshe foundation in a trip in trip to Pakistan last year end of last year came across the nuclear material which was used by the Americans in Iraq and the same time he came in contamination with the chemical war material which were used by Sadam against the court and he moved to Dubai and he went on a death roll. And during that time he was literally dying his belief was the only thing which can save his life CO2 gans water and then we support him with the help of well-known doctors in Middle East we saved his life. Maybe on Tuesday if he comes on he can explain to you exactly what has happened to him. When no other technology can save the large number of American soldiers which have been coming back with diseases unknown and it takes a few days not months and years. We put the hand of peace to the soldiers who create the war and mayhem. Both in Middle East and in the other places in the world with the technology with the peace. We give you the peace for life and then it’s between your soul and what you done wrong in these countries the recording of Brad is with Almond if he is online he can play it, it’s been recorded and it’s in US.<br>凯：其他国家也会一样。尽可能制造更多的单元分发给每一个美国士兵，我们知道有很多美国老兵正在收听这个节目，制作一个，把它给其他士兵，你知道战争给你带来的，如果你正遭受着在从越南战场上得来的病，如果你带着很多问题从伊拉克或阿富汗回来，如果你回来，你的家庭成员遭受战争带来的各种问题，这些战争得到梵蒂冈的金融支持，他们称之为春季起义，用这个系统治愈这些创伤，我们已经在一个人身上取得很好的效果，他接触过废弃的核弹头以及化学辐射影响，他还活着，我们用系统拯救了他，他决定去做。布莱德，你愿意到线上来并解释一下吗，就像你以前做的？布莱德在线吗？还是睡了？（瑞克：在这里没看见他，他没有显示出来，没看见他，凯史先生）好的，我们公开这些，因为布莱德已经说过发生在他身上的，在上周的教学中。这不是私人的教学，是公开教学。布莱德是凯史基金会的成员之一，去年去巴基斯坦，经过核材料，这些核材料是美国用在伊拉克的，同时他也遭遇了化学材料影响，这些化学物质是萨达姆用来对付国际制裁的，然后他去迪拜，无可治愈等待死亡，在那段时间，他接近死亡，他的信念是唯一能拯救他的生命的，二氧化碳甘斯水，然后我们请中东最有名的医生帮助他，拯救了他。也许在星期二，如果他来，就能解释发生的真实情况，没有其他的技术能够拯救这些带着未知疾病回来的美国士兵，而且这个系统只需要几天而不是几个月或几年才有发生效果。我们把和平之手伸向这些在中东和世界其他地区制造战争与伤害的士兵，随着这项技术带来和平，我们给予你生命的和平，就在你的灵魂与你制造战争伤害的国家之间，布莱德的记录是由阿曼负责的，如果他在线，就能播放一下，被记录在美国。<br>This technology will change and now we are ready to deliver the change when we say ask collectively as all the Keshe foundation members across the world. We need huge amount of donation from you to the Keshe foundation we are not looking to the cash donation we are looking for donations from pens, pads for you to give to public that they can see how they can use it teach them and go on the mass teaching. You made the pads you seen the wires you made everything else now give it to public and use it as a what we did technology is peace. I can teach you much more but that goes on Tuesday you have seen a new technology a new development and that’s how we will work. WE will deliver the following weeks a full technology blueprint for Agriculture and we decontamination if you countries which are contaminated with whatever we deliver you a technology we can decontaminate they we help with Fukushima now we release the full technology and questions? If it’s your intention yes because we done it before even it stops drug addiction and alcohol addiction. Renon team is building a system for that purpose. We shown that with the, we shown that with what I call Micro bio nuclear materials disease it’s a very horrible to, it creates a lot of mayhem in your body yes it can be done. Renon would, you are on the background put the other unit which we spoke with will be available too. All the units. Hello? I think he is busy getting himself ready for Tuesday we dropped a huge bomb on him.<br>凯：这项科技将会带来改变，我们已经准备好传达这种改变，当我们说，我们世界上的凯史基金会的成员作为一个整体，我们需要你给凯史基金会大量的捐赠，我们不是寻求现金的捐赠，我们是寻求笔，包，然后分发给你们，你们再送给大众，告诉他们怎么使用，教会他们，让他们听公共教学。你做了医疗包，你看见过线圈，你制作了其他东西，现在送给其他人，然后让别人使用，因为我们的科技是和平的。我能教给你们更多东西，但那要等到星期二，你已经看见一个新的技术，一个新的进展，这就是我们如何工作的。我们会在接下来几周释放完全的关于农业的技术蓝图，我们能去污，净化，如果你的国家遭受污染，我们传送给你技术，你就能去污，净化。就像我们帮助福岛事件一样。现在我们释放这完全的技术。有问题吗？（瑞克：是的，这里有人问到，我们会在星期二…..)是的，取决于你的意愿，因为我们以前做过，甚至这个系统可以治愈你的药物成瘾与酒精成瘾。雷农团队正在为这个目标建立一个系统。（瑞克：那能够治愈….)我们展示过，加做微生化核材料疾病，这是一种可怕的疾病在你的身体上创造很大的伤害，是的，能够被治愈。雷农，你在后台，你能把所有的装置都准备好吗？在吗？我想他正在忙于为星期二做准备，我们给了他很大的任务。<br>[Rick]:Yes,it is true.There are questions I want to more comments and suggestions actually that it would be good to have a brochure actually or some work of leaflet to give with the health pen and so on<br>瑞克：是的，这里有一些问题，很多评论与建议，比如最好制作一个小册子，或者发传单时顺便送笔等等<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Build it write it in your own handwriting, make it in your own language we have a leaflet. Is Ella in the background? Ella are you there? Ella can we post the leaflet which is done for the pens and the pads on the blueprint section?<br>凯：制作吧，手写出来，用你的语言写出来，我们有一个传单。艾拉在后台吗？在吗？艾拉，我们能把做好的传单随着笔和包一起放在蓝图部分吗？<br>[Ella]: Yeah we can do that<br>艾拉：好，我们可以做到<br>[Mr. Keshe]: We have it ready?<br>凯：我们准备好了吗<br>[Ella]: For the pain pad we have it for the pen I can ask for it<br>艾拉：减痛包的话我们准备好了，笔的话，正在要求制作<br>[Mr. Keshe]; I think the factory is doing a colourful one if you can ask them from there<br>凯：我认为工厂正在做一个彩色的，如果你们要求他们这样<br>[Ella]: I am going to contact them and the ask them to give<br>艾拉：我正要联系他们，要求他们这样做<br>[Mr. Keshe]: It will be ready by Tuesday it would be nice<br>凯：如果在星期二准备好就更好了<br>[Ella]: We will try<br>艾拉：我们试试<br>[Mr. Keshe]: okay thank you very much any other questions? You don’t see Renon anywhere?<br>凯：好的，谢谢。有其他问题吗？看见雷农了吗？<br>[Rick]: I see him I will try to get. Oh there he is go ahead Renon.<br>瑞克：我看见了，我在联系，雷农上去吧<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Renon the helmet piece should be ready by Tuesday too?<br>凯：雷农，头盔部分也要在星期二准备好<br>[Renon]: Yes sir the helmet piece we will just cut the, because we have already the 6 string design so we will just replace it with the coils<br>雷农：是的，先生，头盔我们将会切这个，因为我们已经有6个带子的设计，我们将用线圈替换掉<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Okay that’s prefect thank you very much indeed so we will show you how we can paralysis and how you can bring a stroke condition back to normality or least most of normality and reverse addiction on Tuesday too but you test it and you tell us.<br>凯：好的，十分感谢，我们将会展示如何治疗瘫痪，如何让中风回到正常，或基本正常，还有治疗上瘾，都在星期二。但你们来测试，并告诉我们。<br>[Renon]: Okay sir<br>雷农：好的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much indeed thanks Renon. The we have one of the most fantastic innovation group in Philippine, it’s a pleasure to have you on board of the foundation as a team there are number of them now 2, 3 of the have become teachers and on the Keshe foundation team on the plasma technology they spend a lot of time teaching at least sharing knowledge with a couple of them for past 4, 5 months and now we see the beauty of how they shine. What are other questions?<br>凯：十分感谢，雷农。我们在菲律宾有一个很有创新性的团队，很高兴能有你们在凯史基金会的团队里，现在其中2到3人成为了教师，在凯史基金会团队，在等离子体科技上，他们花了大量时间进行教学，在过去4到5个月分享各种知识，现在我们看见他们如此闪耀，有其他问题吗？<br>[Rick]: Well there is an unusual question of how do a, from Hans how do I make more family gans for cancer patients.<br>瑞克：这里有一个特殊的问题，怎么做芬尼甘斯治疗癌症？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Listen on Tuesday<br>凯史：等到星期二。<br>[Rick]; CO2 gel pads will go around the eyes to reduce stress and for the eyes skin?<br>瑞克：如果把CO2胶体包放在眼睛周围，来减缓眼部的压力以及眼睛皮肤的问题，会怎么样？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Listen on Tuesday on Tuesday we go through everything possible ask as many people to be online world wide that they can go out and teach. No other question.<br>凯史：等到星期二。在星期二我们会回答所有问题，问尽可能多的在网上的人，我们会尽力教授，其他问题。<br>[Rick]: No there is more. Do you use gans water or CO2 gans?<br>瑞克：没有很多了。你是用甘斯水，还是CO2甘斯？<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Never use CO2 gans. Under no circumstances especially do not consume it. I hear a lot of talk with the almonds and are getting people to eat this and it has nothing to do with gans and people drink it as we see all sorts of stomach bleeding and all sorts of problems. Gans is not almonds it came out of one guy in Keshe foundation got kicked out it was part of the what I call devious activities of the over there and he is pushing this thing through to those of you who work with almonds please do not turn up at Keshe foundation meetings because you sit there and you advice people the wrong way and then you give us a bad do you are the enemies of the foundation. You are the enemies of humanity. Almonds have been around for years and people have tried it and it never worked and now they are using it to discredit the foundation get people drinking it and doing things and bleeding and so you this what it is. If you work around the Keshe foundation you work with gans if you are people who have managed not to do for years and now you bring you old terminology to give people poison and the name of it, it’s the same people who poisoned me in the Soncino it’s the same group they are pushing the same to create the same mayhem never ever drink gans.<br>凯：从没用CO2甘斯，无论任何情况下，尤其不要直接消费。我听过在Almond很多这样的谈论，它在教唆人们直接吃它，这与甘斯无关，教唆人们饮用它，我们看见各种胃出血，以及其他各种问题。这种情况发生是由于这样一个人，他在凯史基金会被踢出去，这是那里很多不正当活动中的一部分，他在推动这些事，那些与他合作的人，不要出现在凯史基金会的会议中，因为你们在教授人们错误的方式，你们给我们造成很坏的影响，相当于是基金会的敌人，是人类的敌人，Almond已经存在很多年了，人们试过，但从没有成功，现在他们想使基金会名誉扫地，让人们饮用它，做其他的，然后流血，这就是他们所做的。如果你工作在基金会的周围，你就在与甘斯打交道，如果你是那些这几年一直没做什么，现在开始用一些旧的术语忽悠他人，给他人毒药，这是一些同样的人在意大利松奇诺毒害我的人，是同一个团队，利用同样的手法制造同样的伤害，绝不要喝甘斯。<br>Those who tell you its almonds are the people who are trying to destroy you and they work, and you use that word. It’s the same people, it’s the same 2, 3 people who plan my death of poisoning in the Soncino and they use the word Amish because they fix it now they go somewhere else to poison you and so you see this is what is does. Gans cannot, should not drank. This is the same part of the circle the red circle in Entrap who are doing the same thing. Do not touch use gloves when you touch nano material because your body can change the nano material in the gans condition if you carry salt on your body which most of you do? And then that’s what we say do not ever never consume gans. Let those who do tell them you drink one litre and not call it the almonds as you seen the guy in golden age of gans it touched a little bit of our… is he online he can tell you he was pissing blood.<br>凯：那些告诉你Almonds 的人是想要摧毁你的人，他们这样工作让你相信他们的话，这是一些同样的人，就是这同样的2到3人计划在松奇诺毒害我，他们使用这个词Amish，因为他们改了。现在他们去其他地方来毒害你们，你可以看到这是怎么一回事，甘斯不能喝，这也是在安特普的红圈所做的事情，不要触碰，用手套，当你碰到甘斯材料，因为你的身体能够改变在甘斯环境下的纳米材料，如果你的身体里有盐分，你们大多数人都有。就像我说的千万别直接食用甘斯，让那些叫你饮用甘斯的人自己去饮用。我们见过在甘斯的黄金时代上的一个人触碰到了一点….他在线吗？他会告诉你怎样滴血的<br>Marcus and he put the pictures on the internet. Anybody tells you it’s almost tell them you drink it, gans is not drinkable and use the right word for it that is what it does it’s a plasma high level energy. These are bunch of fail people who would not do anything for decades now they see the back of the Keshe foundation to get the right and this guy’who uses it almost when he started it is the same group as they tried to poison me to kill their name is on the international police file. Never touch gans never drink gans. As Caroline says on the internet if you read the guidance almonds is the opposite of gans. And these people are causing the mayhem and allow you to drink and cause problems so you see how dangerous it is, we tell you as the head of the Keshe foundation do not touch do not drink anything which carries pure gans in it, the water which is taken from separation of the part wall from the gans can be drunk<br>凯：马卡斯，他把一些图片放在网上了，任何 人告诉你饮用甘斯，你都要明白甘斯不能饮用，你要使用正确的用语，它是一个高层次能量的等离子体，这是一群失败的人的组合，几十年都没有做成什么，现在他们要利用凯史基金会的漏洞， 就是这个家伙建立的团伙试图毒害我，他们的名字在国际警署文件里，绝不触碰甘斯，绝不饮用甘斯，就像卡洛琳所说，在网上，你读到Almonds的指导，都是站在甘斯的对立面的。这些人正在制造伤害，让你饮用甘斯，引出问题，你看，这是多么危险，作为凯史基金会的领导人我告诉你们不要触碰，不要饮用里面带有纯甘斯的东西，如果是从有屏障能将甘斯隔离的装置取出的水可以饮用。<br> because that carries energy according to what the water can carry not the material itself. It’s very much like when you make serum you cannot inject yourself with the poison it kills you but you make a certain weaker condition for it to be absorbed there is no other way to explain anyone in any of the talks any of the teachings of Keshe foundation you say they talks while they almost see you at the end the enemy of the foundation. That’s how you stop it there is no other way. And this is for the almonds thing trying to create mayhem by the same people who poison me in the Keshe foundation to kill. The name as I said is signed and locked with the international police. In time they will see prison for it it’s not easy to go and kill a child a man and a woman understand gans is a high energy package and when you drink a lot of it your body cannot absorb even a tip touch of it cannot absorb. It’s a huge energy. Understand exactly what you are doing<br>凯：因为那携带的能量是根据水自身能够携带的程度决定的，而不是材料本身。这就很像你制作血清，你不能直接混合毒药给自己注射，这会杀死你，但你如果制造一个更为弱的环境使它被吸收，没有其他方法来解释，任何人，任何在凯史基金会教学中谈话的人，你说他们在谈话，然后再见，结果成为凯史基金会的敌人，这就是你如何阻止而没有其他办法，就像Almonds这样的事都是同样的人，同样的想在凯史基金会杀死我的人。他们的名字就像我说的，被国际警署锁定。迟早他们会进监狱，想要杀死一个孩子，男人或女人不是那么简单的，要理解，甘斯是一种高能量包，当你喝了很多，你的身体会接受不了，即使是触碰一点，也会接受不了。这是巨大的能量，清楚理解你所做的。<br>[Rick]: Mr. Keshe what about the nano coated copper wire in a cup of water to clarify the pollution and so on…<br>瑞克：凯史先生，那么将纳米铜放在一杯水净化污染，然后<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You don’t use it the water left over can be used but not the bottom material.<br>凯：放上一段时间后可以用，但不是瓶底的<br>[Rick]: You allow to stand for a while to allow the …<br>瑞克：所以你得放上一段时间<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You have to for an hour or 2 and you only take the top. One of the biggest problems in the future will be the amount of ganses we collect to clean up the mess what we are going to do with the them. We will show you what to do with them. This is what I explain in the other teaching on Tuesday or in the other teachings yesterday fir the institute we have all got involved in with the gans get this material, this is a change of matter to plasma condition a lot of you have to start looking on how to change the plasma of the gans into a  matter state so what they collect during the rivers they you find you have tons of gold or whatever plutonium aluminium whatever which is been floating and all the poisons which just been  in the rivers now we can separate them we collect them we separate them. Conversion of the plasma to gans to matter state is another art itself, any other question? No questions we call it a day it’s nearly 2 and half hours we have a long day on Tuesday.<br>凯：必须这样，1到2个小时，而且你只能使用顶部的水，在未来最大的一个问题是收集大量的甘斯来去除污染，我们会用它这么做，我们会告诉你怎么做，这就是我们一个星期二的教学或者昨天的为太空学院的教学中所说的，我们都介入到生产甘斯的过程中，这是一种通向等离子体环境的物质改变，你们很多人开始考虑怎么讲等离子体转换为物质状态，于是他们在河水中收集到的是，你会发现你有上吨的金子，或者钚，铝，这些都是漂浮在河水上，所有的在河水中的污染我们都能分离出它们，收集它们；将等离子体转换为甘斯，以及物质状态是另外一种艺术，其他问题？没有问题，我们已经进行了2个半小时，我们在星期二有一整天。<br>[Rick]; Okay I have these other question but we could go on for hours as far as that goes and many of the question will be answered on Tuesday.<br>瑞克：好，我这里有另外一些问题，可能会持续几个小时，这些问题会在星期二被解答。<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Yeah I think it is better than we are ready people can see we have a full demonstration with the units that we can see like we did with the Magrav systems we gave the power unit the gift to the ambassador we give the health unit as a gift to humanity so everyone of you is an ambassador to receive it, it depends on how you receive it and give it to the nationalities and people of where you live. Thank you very much for you time today and hopefully we meet on Tuesday. Yes.<br>凯：是的，我认为最好我们准备好了，人们会看见我们有关于装置的充足的展示，就像我们对磁引力场装置做的那样，我们把磁引力场装置交给大使。我们将医疗装置作为礼物交给人类。所以现在你们每一个人都将是来接受这个装置的大使，这取决于你怎么接受它，并把它交给你国家的人们以及你居住地的人们。谢谢，星期二再见。<br>[Mamira]: Hello Mr. Keshe this Mamira from India<br>麦米拉：你好，凯史先生，我是来自印度的<br>[Mr. Keshe]: yes welcome.<br>凯：好，欢迎<br>[Mamira]: hi, very nice work Mr, Keshe I am doing everything for myself I hear today I just want to present my testimonials and I have been preparing my pain pad and pain pens and I use for myself and I was giving, I right now I have given for 30 people here and everyone till now have really gotten instantly relief and they say that it works like magic, from my grandmother to many elders and youngster and people with lumps and people who couldn’t walk and not even one side effect and it has worked perfectly till now I have been given. Its been one month till now no complaints and it’s been working marvellous, I just want to thank you and apart from that I have also been, my friends are all here we were just a little bit fascinated by this technology when they are ask me how I do it and show them, and I though its little strange few matter they just appreciate this technology because they receive the research and I just want to thank you and next month I am planning set up a meeting with one of the orphanage where there are like 50 kids girls kids who are like, below the hips it’s not functional nothing is functioning below the hips I thought I would give this pain pen and pain pad right now that’s the data I have.<br>麦：嗨，凯史先生，我在做相关的所有事情，今天我想要展示我的测试报告，我已经制作了我的减痛包和笔，我自己在使用中，我也在分发给其他人，已经给了这里的30个人，每个人好像立刻得到了缓解，他们说这就像魔法，我的奶奶，许多长者，年轻人，有肿块的人，不能行走的人，甚至有许多问题的人，这些装置都在令人惊奇的良好的工作，我想要说很感谢你，除了那之外，我的朋友们在这里，我们对这种科技很着迷，他们问我怎么制作的，展示给他们看，我给他们看了一些东西，他们很赞赏这种科技，因为他们看到这种神奇，我想说很感谢，下个月我计划在一个孤儿院举行一个会议，那里有50个孩子，臀部以下不能正常运转，我在想我能给一些减痛笔与减痛包，这就是我要说的。<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Thank you very much indeed can you please go to Keshe foundation webmaster give your name we can do a lot with you, India is one of the weakest point of Keshe foundation we cannot break through so easy we support you and if the webmaster will write master at spaceshipinstitute.org straight away and then they will out you in touch with me and then through that I will teach you how to get most of these children walking.<br>凯：谢谢，请你到凯史基金会的网站，告诉你的名字，我们可以为你做很多，印度是凯史基金会的一个薄弱点，我们不能很快的取得突破与进展，我们支持你，在spaceshipinstitute.org上写信给站长，他们会让你与我取得联系，然后我会教你怎样让这些孩子走路<br>[Mamira]: wow thank you<br>麦：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Take a camera video take a telephone mobile camera video I will sit online case by case I will tell you what to do that you get the children or majority of them hopefully a lot of them walking back again we got to see what he case is if you can’t hear and how it will be done, and you do it locally<br>凯：拿一个视屏相机，手机视屏，我会在网上一步步教你，让这些大多数孩子又能站起来行走，我看看具体是什么情况，如果你听不见或者不知如何做，你就现场示范<br>[Mamira]; Thanks<br>麦：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Please get in touch with us we need to do that<br>凯：请联系我们，我们需要你这样做<br>[Devek]: Mr, Keshe, its Devek here my brother and I have been working for some time together now I can get all the necessary contact information.<br>戴夫：凯史先生，我的兄弟和我已经在一起工作了一段时间，现在我们能得到所有必要的联系信息<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Please get with me directly. Let me tell you what is the problem how we see the problem sitting. We have a young brilliant guy sitting in India his name is Abina, one of them, Abina he start making the pens and sending through DHL India DHL. DHL is another company to be trusted you have seen the work of DHL in Belgium too they steal technology, what they did he sent pain pads to people to discredit the technology they took the copper coils out of the pen and they delivered empty pens to the customers it show how much the government pay the what you call it pay DHL even in delivery of the systems. DHL is heavily interfering with the books of the Keshe foundation with everything to do with the Keshe foundation, if you are sending anything through DHL as a gift one of the systems please do not do so.<br>凯：请直接与我联系，让我来告诉你问题是什么，以及我们怎样观察问题的状态。我们有一个年轻的人在印度，他的名字是阿比拿，他制作笔，通过DHL快递公司发到印度，DHL被许多人信任，你们已经看到这个公司在比利时所做的，他们偷窃技术，他发笔给人们，而DHL拿走里面的铜线圈，发空心的笔给顾客，这显示出政府付给DHL多少钱，在它的发送系统中。DHL严重阻碍凯史基金会的运行，书的发行，如果你要寄送这些系统装置，请不要用DHL<br>In India we have a huge problem DHL is part of the terrorist organisation which sits with the government because we seen them empty pens deliberately Abina can tell you what they have done to it, to discredit him to discredit the technology. I use the name freely let us, let them sue us, every book which is gone will be seen as gone missing everything which is delivered by DHL has gone missing with the Keshe foundation. So it’s the same with the PayPal we stopped using the pay pal because of the same instruction these are supposed to be free companies but are part of what we call the old structure. Do not use account of pay pal because pay pal is there for one purpose to control what is happening as part of the international banking system to control. Close your account with pay pal. Use any other company but PayPal because that is what they do. Let them through the foundation we show it black and white. DHL has emptied every single pen which Abina has sent out just to discredit in India the same in Belgium so it cannot be coincidence. Anything else let us know we can help you we support you as I told you we are, we have a huge structure to help India we are approaching as many Indians as we can to break into this country that we can set up manufacturing for people by the people. If you do such a work I am prepared to what you ask to put and finance you deliver these units and help people. Get in touch with me through Rick and then we tell you what you do. Now you are a lady and  The word you tell me you done the same as what we done with Angeline with Alex we will ask you to build and deliver.<br>凯：在印度，我们有很大的问题，DHL是恐怖组织的一部分，与政府有紧密联系。因为我们看见他们将笔掏空，阿比拿能告诉你他们所做的，用以使他和这项科技声名扫地。让他们起诉我们，每本书应该会看到的书都不见了，每个从凯史基金会由DHL寄送的东西都不见了，在Paypal也是一样的情况，我们停止使用Paypal,因为同样的指使，这些本应该是自由的公司，但确是我们所说的旧制度的一部分，不要使用Paypal账户，因为它的存在是作为国际银行系统进行控制手段的一部分，关闭这个账户，使用其他的除了Paypal,这就是它们所做的，让他们对付基金会我们自会展示出黑白，DHL掏空了阿比拿寄送的每一只笔，在印度，同样在比利时，所以这不是巧合。有什么其他事情请让我们知道，我们能够帮助你，就像我告诉你的，我们有一个强大的结构帮助印度，我们正在逐步推进，与许多印度人一起在这个国家取得突破，我们能在印度由印度人建立工厂，如果你做这样的工作，我准备好满足你的任何需要，在金融上帮助你传递这些装置给其他人，通过瑞克与其取得联系，我们来告诉你做什么，现在你是一位女士，你所说的告诉我们你在做与安捷利尔和阿历克斯同样的事情，我们会告诉你构建系统并设法传递出去。<br>[Mamira]: Thank you<br>麦：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]; Thank you very much indeed. Make sure when you go to these people with the children with the paralysis a lot of them can be reversed we have enough knowledge in the foundation to give support to do it.<br>凯：真的很感谢你。当你再去这些人，这些有瘫痪症的孩子的身边时告诉他们，他们能够被治愈好，我们在基金会有足够的知识来支持这样做<br>[Mamira]: Yes Mr. Keshe thank you<br>麦;谢谢，凯史先生<br>[Mr. Keshe]: You are welcome I have all the they need a special seat and we have these seats available already in the stock in Italy we can send it to you freely immediately we can send hundreds of them I tell you how to structure it and you get the children to sit in it for 2, 3 months they can’t go anywhere and you see most of them will start walking what the problem with what the disease could be.<br>凯：不客气，他们需要一个特殊的椅子，我们在意大利的库存里有很多，我们能够立刻免费寄送给你，寄送上百个，我告诉怎样排列，你让孩子坐在里面2到3个月，不去任何其他地方，你会看见他们中大多数会站起来走路，治愈这个病带来的问题<br>[Mamira]: Thanks Mr. Keshe thank you.<br>麦：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]; isn’t that what you need thanks for your work. Thank you very much. Devek please make sure you see her as fast as possible.<br>凯：这正是你所需要的，谢谢你的工作。十分感谢。戴夫，请尽快与她取得联系。<br>[Devek]: yes sir I sent you an email within the next 10 minutes.<br>戴夫：好的，在10分钟内我发给你一封邮件<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much indeed<br>凯：谢谢<br>[Devek]: Thank you sir<br>戴夫：谢谢<br>[Mr. Keshe]; anything else any other surprises?<br>凯：还有其他的吗？还有其他出人意料的吗？<br>[Rick]: that was … she had her hand up earlier, but I think there is various many other question but I guess it have to wait till Tuesday for the answers.<br>瑞克：那是….她举起了手，但我认为这是一个很偏的问题，还是等星期二的教学吧<br>[Mr. Keshe]: Thank you very much indeed I thank especially Renon and the innovation team in Philippine and US and hopefully we will see on Tuesday get as many people as possible to come online on Tuesday advertise worldwide that we can deliver that we can change the whole of the pharmaceutical on humanity. Thank you very much indeed. Thank you bye<br>凯：谢谢，特别感谢雷农和他的菲律宾创新团队，以及美国团队，我们期待在星期二见面，让尽可能多的人进来，在世界上发布消息，我们能传递我们能改变人类目前的整个医药史。十分感谢，再见。<br>[Rick]: Okay, Thank you Mr. Keshe. Okay that will wrap it up for the 97th Keshe knowledge seekers works for Thursday January 21st 2016 and once again thank you everybody for attending and we will see you next Tuesday for more of this public information. Okay we will end the live stream.<br>瑞克：好的，谢谢凯史先生，好的，这就是2016年1月21日的第97次凯史基金会知识寻求者教学，谢谢每一个参与进来的人，我们会在下个星期二为公众释放更多的信息，好的，我要关闭直播了。</p>
