<p>Beginning of the video<br>（宣传）视频开始<br>“You are people listening from every corner of this planet …<br>“这个星球各个角落的听众都在收听我们的教学。<br>No knowledge has been disbursed so beautifully, so balanced, across the planet, on this planet ever … maybe in the Universe!<br>知识从来没有像现在这样在这个星球、在宇宙中如此美妙、如此平衡地传播！<br>You have the full potential of achieving everything in the Universe. There is no need, and there is no reason for Man not to achieve. So, wherever you are, the way I taught you to make the coils, the double coil inside, you have continuous equal gravitational-magnetic fields, and if you put Co2 on it, and you put Zinc on it, you have connected the emotion of the Man through it, in a stable condition. And you will find out, you become a very peaceful Man.<br>你拥有在这个宇宙中实现任何事物的全部能力。没有必要也没有理由说人类无法实现。 通过我教给你们制造套在里面的双线圈，你拥有了持续的平衡的斥引力场。 如果你把CO2、锌放在（线圈）上面， 你通过它就能连接到人类的情感，在稳定的条件下你将发现你会变成一个非常和平的人。<br>Here, instead of having galaxies and universes, and creating connection magnetically, we have used the matter-state gravitational-magnetic field strength, to dominate and dictate the shape of the Plasma. The nano-technology, the nano-materials which you have collectively developed in different ways, by caustic, by electric currents, by whatever, fire or whatever, has that advantage, that the Matter, the Nano, and the Plasma is all the same. So, connection is very solid, it’s very strong.<br>在这里，我们用物质状态的引力-斥力场的强度去描述星系和宇宙，用引力去创建连接，去支配和控制等离子体的形状。这些纳米技术、纳米材料在不同的地区通过不同的方式获得， 通过诸如烧碱、电流、火烧等任何方便或麻烦的方式，纳材料和等离子体（的属性）仍然维持不变。因此这个联接是非常牢固非常强大的。<br>The power of the Plasma technology the way we have thought, is beyond imagination of the man. Now, you can create and control the Plasma, which is the Mother of the Creation of the Universe. We are given the seed of the Essence of the Creation.<br>The Foundation does not belong to no one, and is not made of one anymore. You are developing it, you are structuring it, and from today, we’ll still be the same. We’ll still develop the technology, in different names, in different colours, in different nationalities (which they do not exist). It is beautiful when we see, the Christian, the Muslims, the Jews, and every other belief, are working together to build up systems. We have already become one faith. We already have become one nation, and we already have become one planet.<br>我们认为这样的等离子体技术的能量的方式，是超过人类的想象的。现在，你可以制造和控制等离子体了。等离子体是宇宙造物的源头。我们已给了你们非常重要的造物的种子。凯史基金会不属于任何人，也不是由一个组成了，你们发展、构建她。以后都这样一直通过不同的名字、不同的肤色、在不同的国家（以后它不存在）来发展这项技术。当我们看见基督徒们、 穆斯林们、犹太人和其他不同信仰的人在一起共同建造这个系统，是非常美妙的。我们早已变成共同的信仰，我们已经成为一个种族、一个星球。<br>You’ve got to remember one thing… “Dates” is irrelevant. Today is the last day of the Christian calendar, or tomorrow is the beginning of another… One date is connected to another. We don’t stop. We are working around the clock. The Keshe Foundation team is working irrespective of time, position, religion, country.<br>你们必须记住一件事情：“日期”是无关的。今天是基督教历法的最后一天，明天会是新的开始，一天接着一天，我们不会停下来，我们会日以继夜地工作，凯史基金会团队的工作不分时间、地域、宗教、国家。<br>And now, we achieve what we set out for !”<br>现在我们正在为实现目标而前进！”<br>(Mehran T. Keshe to the Nations of the World, transcribed by Pawel)<br>(迈赫兰.T.凯史致世界各国    帕韦尔记录）<br>第一部分<br>00:08:31<br>Rick:Welcome everyone to the 108th … sorry, welcome everyone to the 8th International Knowledge Seekers Workshop. That would be the other Knowledge Seekers Workshop, that would be the 108th.<br>We are on the 8th International Knowledge Seekers Workshop, it’s Tuesday, March 8th 2016 and we’re online with Mr. Keshe of the Keshefoundation Spaceship Institute.<br>And I believe he’s ready to go with this teaching and on international affairs.<br>Mr. Keshe, are you ready to go there?<br>瑞克：欢迎大家收看凯史基金会第8次国际教学，今天是2016年3月8日星期二，我们将在线上与凯史先生共同探讨。<br>凯史先生，准备好了吗？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:Yes, good day to you, good morning, good evening, whenever and wherever you’re listening to these teachings as usual.<br>Keshe先生：准备好了，大家早上好，晚上好，祝所有正在收听教学的人们拥有美好的一天。</p>
<p>You were correct in a way we are already this week on the 104th teaching. Which is exactly two years, we started these teachings. Two years ago, this week, officially we started the Knowledge Seekers and when we come to Thursday, it’s our 104th program anniversary.<br>两年前的周四，我们正式开始知识寻求者教学，所以本周四是凯史基金会开展教学的2周年纪念日。</p>
<p>No scientific organization has worked this way.<br>No scientific group has ever achieved, what we have achieved collectively.<br>以前从没有任何科学团队能以这样的方式开展教学，但我们做到了。</p>
<p>No organization has gone so advanced in the knowledge of the man what gathered, what was, what took thousands of years. In matter of two years is rewritten.<br>几千年来没有任何组织能如此超前地向人们传授知识，但凯史基金会仅仅在2年内就做到了。</p>
<p>00:10:11<br>But this time collectively we have done it. We have managed to do it and in the coming time we will open a new cycle of teaching. As we said, when we started the first term of 2015 for 1st Year Knowledge Seekers or 3 Years course, we explain very simply, that we will open the door of the space technology in it´s true form. And, as some of You have seen in some of the teachings, and especially what we received after the public teaching from the two sessions of the private teachings last Tuesday, You most probably have got an insight in what´s going to be brought out and what’s going to be taught. There are a couple of things, which are important to understand:<br>通过共同的努力我们已经成功地做到了。接下来我们将开启新的教学周期。2015年是开展新教学的第1年，也是知识寻求者教学的第3年。在这期间我用最简单的方式为大家传授知识，我们将真正步入发展太空科技的大门。在公开教学和两期的私人教学之后，你们应该猜到接下来我要开始教授哪些知识了，这里有2点非常重要：</p>
<p>00:11:10<br>The space technology in the background is 99 % of our teaching.<br>Can You hear me?<br>隐藏在幕后的太空科技几乎是由我们的教学指导的。<br>能听到我说话吗？</p>
<p>Rick:Yes<br>瑞克：可以听到。</p>
<p>MT KESHE:Yes. So, on the other hand, this is space technology, as the need of the man in the space has different sections:<br>You have food, You have energy, you have space travel, You have everything, what a man needs becomes part of this structure.<br>凯史：另一方面，根据人们的需要，太空科技包含不同的方面：<br>人们需要的食物，能量，空间旅行能力，这一切只是这个结构的一部分。</p>
<p>We have seen, how we have to go through understanding the basics.And now, we still have new people who are coming in trying to understand the basics, while the others have got to the point, that the basics are completed for them and they are trying to look at different avenues of it.<br>我们已经看到了人们是如何去学习基础知识的，当一批人掌握要点同时又有新的一批人开始学习基础知识，对基础知识有了一定了解后又会以不同的途径进一步学习。</p>
<p>In our meetings in China and with the chinese leadership and the military and the space agency and the Keshe Foundation China we will release a new dimension into the Keshe Foundation. A new dimension in application and use of the Keshe Foundation Technology. A new structure work , where, as we have said, we will go close with every government hand in hand, to see these applications and implications.<br>通过与中国凯史基金会，中国领导人、军队和航天局的会议，凯史基金会和凯史科技的的发展会向前迈出新的一步。我们会与世界上每一个国家的政府合作共同发展凯史科技。</p>
<p>So, if we speak about the energy part of the Keshe Foundation, like Magrav Units, this is literally finished for the foundation. We have done. We released. Factories are going to be set up.<br>We already have set up the factory of the Keshefoundation in Italy.<br>Germany has gone into production or getting to setup to go for production.<br>Today i have signed four new agreements with World Companies in the United States.<br>In China we will sign new agreements for the establishing of new factories.<br>So the power technology is gone, is irrelevant, we shared the knowledge across.<br>谈到凯史基金会的发展，凯史基金会已经研发了能量单元，在意大利建立了工厂，<br>德国凯史基金会也已经投入生产。<br>今天，我们与在美国的世界性大公司们签署了四项新的协议。<br>我们将与中国政府就建立工厂的问题签署协议。<br>随着我们向全世界传播凯史科技，旧的能源技术将会被淘汰。</p>
<p>And we hear a lot of talk about “Free Energy”.<br>Those people who talk about our Technology and “Free Energy”, these are the people who have some different agenda.<br>This is not a “Free Energy”. If nuclear energy is free, if oil industry is free, then the plasma technology is free, too.<br>So we are talking about total universal free energy.<br>So when you come to energy, energy is irrelevant. We finished it.<br>而且有很多人在讨论新能源技术。<br>这些讨论新能源和凯史科技的人有他们不同的议程。<br>如果核能是免费的，石油工业是免费的，那么等离子技术也是免费的。<br>我们讨论的是全宇宙的自由能源。<br>我们不需要再为能源担忧了，能量单元已经成功地研发了。</p>
<p>From this week Keshefoundation Manufacturing company in Italy is going public in Italy for sale of products. Because now we have received all the licenses. We have completed the cycle of the movement of the factory to come in hand. So from this week, … the beginning of next week or so, … you’ll start seeing the advertising in the next couple of weeks in Italy to buy the products. You should be able to buy all the pens, all the pads, all the Car-Units, all the Magrav-Units in the shops.<br>从本周意大利凯史基金会将公开在意大利出售产品。现在我们获得了了所有的许可证。工厂的运行已经就位。从这周开始……下周……在意大利接下来的2周你会看到凯史基金会的广告。你在商店里就能购买点痛笔，止痛带，车用和家用的能量单元。</p>
<p>It’s not on the Keshefoundation website anymore because we are an Italian organization, we have committed ourselves to the Italian nation and as they have supported us, now that everything is perfect, … we had a tuning to do, 6 months setting up a new technology, new factory takes time … For this reason we are ready and from this week in Italy you will start seeing Keshefoundation products. The Magrav system, for health the pen and the other things which are coming to production in the coming weeks on the shelves in the shops.<br>我们已经成为意大利的一个组织而不单单只是一个网站了，我们致力于意大利的发展，意大利政府也大力支持我们，所有的一切都是如此完美……我们打算在6个月之内开展新的技术，增建新的工厂……未来几周在商店里就可以买到我们的产品。</p>
<p>You can literally buy a Magav Unit off the shelf.This shows how confident we are.Data, energy, medicine, health, agriculture will all follow one by one.<br>我们可以自信地向大家许诺，以后各种与数据，能源，医学，健康，甚至农业相关的产品都会上市。</p>
<p>00:15:00<br>So in this pattern we have achieved what we set out. But energy is irrelevant any more. We don’t have … we still support the factories to go into production. We expect about 16 factories as I see around the world this year. In conjunction with the others we see about 35 factories which I look in the background they could be set up. And each one of these will work the same way. We now have 6 factories written and set starting up or agreement has been signed to start.<br>Each one of these, Keshefoundation Italy will push into 25.000 to 100.000 a month within the next three, four weeks. And then it takes us two months to reach the target.<br>And then we go further to production of other things.<br>我们已经开始实现产品的市场化。但是电力相关的能量装置已经不重要了。我们没有…我们仍然支持工厂投入生产。今年在世界各地预计会有大约16家工厂建立。而且在幕后大约可以建立35家工厂。每一个工厂都会按照相同的模式运作。现在已经有6个工厂签署了协议。<br>意大利凯史基金会会在未来3–4周内提供给每个工厂25000—100000欧元，争取在2个月之内建设完成。然后再进一步实现投产。</p>
<p>So Energy to us is a closed book. Because we have done it, the energy has been tested. We have received huge backup from governments who tested it, they understand it.<br>And there is no way, it doesn’t matter what people say, they can cry and do whatever they like. Because even and some number of countries now are placing orders to be delivered in the next two – three months from the factory because they’ve done their test.<br>所以电力方面的装置已经完结了，并且能量单元也顺利通过测试了，一些测试过能量单元的国家也给与我们巨大的支持。<br>甚至有些国家对能量单元测试完成后，提前2—3个月就向工厂下了订单。</p>
<p>We always said in the energy: “If it’s 100% + 1 then it’s a breakthrough”.<br>At the moment we show 20% - 30% - 60% reduction. People are putting their electricity bills out and open, show they save 60% in the winter time.<br>Because a lot of you never understood: These systems are not kilowatt based!<br>The kilowatt we put is at the beginning that you can’t load your machine, but the rest is open to you.<br>So if you use … we are testing in a school now. Five thousand kilowatt a day usage.<br>This is a huge organization, a school, 5.000kW per day energy use.<br>We start seeing 20-30% reduction. Bills of 150.000€ per month is dropping literally to 85-80.000 and below.<br>如果在能源系统中能节省1%的能耗就已经是一个巨大的突破了。<br>但我们的能量单元可以节省20%–30%甚至60%的电能。人们在冬天公开晾出他们的账单，竟然节省了60%的电能！<br>很多人都没理解：因为能量装置并不是基于电子震动的电压，是基于等离子体。<br>能量装置在开始接入电网时不能加任何负载，但一段时间之后就可以加负载了。<br>所以如果你使用……现在我们在一所学校里测试能量装置。这个学校规模很大，一天要消耗5000kw的电能。<br>现在耗电量已经减少了20%-30%，每个月的电费也由150欧元减少到了85-80欧元，随着测试的进行电费会更少。</p>
<p>So the governments are seeing the what you call it, the dividend. These are the organizations which are testing.<br>政府看到了在各个测试带来的“红利”。</p>
<p>So as far as we concerned, energy is finished, this is done. If we add some more to it, we develop new technologies, we release more.<br>就现在而言，能量装置已经完成的，今后随着开发新的技术进一步改进能源装置，我们到时候会释放更多。</p>
<p>Now the focus goes on the health application.<br>The pens and the pads are released, new health systems which are getting tested like the one we’ve seen in Philippines, like the one we’ve seen in Switzerland or in Austria, they all will come into fruition. They all are coming into line for the use. And in that process we are heading ahead. From now on Magrav systems and the rest are part of the production. There are factories getting producing, you follow.<br>现在的重点是应用在医疗领域的装置。<br>点痛笔和止痛带已经公开释放了，菲律宾研发的的医疗系统和瑞士、奥地利研发的医疗系统都将很快完成研发。并且这些医疗系统将会上市公开销售。与此同时我们正在致力于能量装置和其他生产产品在工厂的的批量生产。</p>
<p>The health section is the more important. The agriculture will come, the recycling of and cleaning of what we’ve seen the waters and air and other things are becoming taking paramount.<br>These are the things. In China we release 4 new totally technologies to the government of Chinese.<br>It’s a gift from Keshefoundation to the nation of China.<br>对人们来说医疗装置更为重要，随后农业装置也会跟进。废物的回收再利用、对水和空气的清洁与治理也变得越来越重要。<br>我们向中国政府发布了4项新的完全技术。<br>是凯史基金会带给中国的礼物。</p>
<p>We will announce when we are there and it’ll be handed over the technology we’ll explain, and Keshe Foundation China will become part of the Chinese organizations in every way that they see fit.<br>这些技术会在我访问中国时交给中国政府，而且中国凯史基金会于某种方式上将成为中国组织的一部分。</p>
<p>In so many ways we do not see any process to delay. We do not see any reason for delaying the process. We do not see any reason for not stepping into the Space Technology now that we have achieved most of what we wanted.<br>任何进程都没有被拖延。现在我们已经实现了我们的目标，使对太空技术的渴望深入人心。</p>
<p>We have achieved Space Technology in a drastic way. This is part of the totality. We can’t send man into space. Energy, the way we are producing it, even when you are buying it, does not exist in the space. It’s irrelevant. These are by-products which is coming in.<br>除了已经实现的空间技术，其它要做的还有很多。现在人类还不能步入太空，即使能量单元也不能满足人类步入太空的条件。</p>
<p>The steps are in the direction of change.<br>情势正在改变。</p>
<p>The steps are in the direction of change. These are direction into change the totality.<br>Next step for us is the appeal we have received from people in Cyprus.<br>We have received appeal from the Keshefoundation supporters in Germany.<br>情势正在彻底的改变。<br>下一步是我们为塞浦路斯人民的上诉。<br>同样我们也为德国凯史基金会的支持者们上诉。</p>
<p>20:00<br>We have received appeals from the others, in the Middle East, where due to the wars created deliberately for finance reasons, a lot of people are displaced. We received an email, a communication, a request from Cyprus. We have Syrian refugees in Cyprus who have no food, and they are fighting, over a piece of bread because they have nothing to eat.<br>我们还受其他国家的人民委托上诉。在中东由于人为的战争造成金融低迷，许多人流离失所。我们收到了一封来自塞浦路斯的电子邮件。在塞浦路斯有许多叙利亚难民，这些难民没有任何食物，甚至为了一片面包互相争斗。</p>
<p>20:22<br>These were the richest people in the Middle East two years ago. We respond to you. We release a new technology. We release a new technology today to the request which we have received.<br>Would you like, Rick, you have this email, request from Cyprus. Would you like to read it for us?<br>Are you there, Rick ?<br>这些难民曾经是两年前中东最富有的人。今天我们会为这些难民发布新的食物系统。<br>瑞克，你那里也有塞浦路斯发的电子邮件，你为我们读读吧。<br>你在那里，瑞克？</p>
<p>Rick : As I have to locate that Mr Keshe…<br>瑞克：凯史先生，我得找找……</p>
<p>MK : Can you bring it out ?<br>凯史：你能找到吗？</p>
<p>R: a minute …<br>瑞克：等一会啊……</p>
<p>MK : We are receiving a lot of requests from european nations, from Arab, from Jewish, from Christians, in a way, we are receiving from Keshe Foundation Family. Requests to help in the mayhem which is created by the flow of refugees due to Syria and the Middle East affairs. We are responding. We release today. I ask for a meeting. I need two or three people to confirm that it is OK with them.<br>凯史：我们收到了许多欧洲国家的请求，还有些来自阿拉伯、犹太人、基督徒，他们都是凯史基金会大家庭中的一员。请求帮助处理由叙利亚难民涌入和中东问题造成的混乱。我们正在给予回应。我们今天会开一个会议，并释放一些技术，但需要2个或3个人确定相关情况。</p>
<p>Jacky ! Is it OK if we release what we have been doing with you these past few days ? Are you online ?<br>杰克！前几天我们和你一起开发的技术你准备好今天释放了吗？你在线吗？</p>
<p>J : Yes! Can you hear me ?<br>杰克：我在线，你能听到我的声音吗？</p>
<p>MK : yes! Is it OK with you if we release because you’re part of the test, you set up the system.<br>凯史：我能听到你的声音！今天能释放这项技术吗？因为你也是该项目的一员，你建立了这个系统。</p>
<p>J : Yeah! The team said it’s OK<br>杰克：今天可以释放，我们的科研团队说了可以。</p>
<p>MK : Is Ali on the line ? … Maybe he’s asleep. … Vince, is it OK in what we have been doing in past two, three nights to be released public ? … Rick, you are part of the structure : is it OK with you to release it ?<br>凯史:阿里在线吗……也许他正睡觉呢……文斯，前几天晚上我们研发的技术今天能公开发布吗？……瑞克，你也参与了建立这个系统：今天可以释放吗？</p>
<p>R: I think that will be OK<br>瑞克：可以释放了。</p>
<p>MK : Would you like to read the text we received ?<br>凯史：你能为我们读一读我们收到的邮件吗？</p>
<p>R : I can’t ! From Cyprus… I am not sure what you mean Mr Keshe… I don’t know… what…<br>瑞克：这个，我恐怕不能，赛皮鲁斯的邮件……我不知道您说的…..我还不知道……什么是……</p>
<p>MK : It’s on your messenger, sent to you.<br>凯史：在你的收件箱里，我发给你了。</p>
<p>R : Messenger… I don’t normally… Ok, great thanks !<br>瑞克：收件箱……找到了，谢谢您。</p>
<p>MK : Because you usually read everything out. There, we understand it is not us, it is as ONE Family, ONE Nation, and ONE Planet. We have to respond. We cannot ….(noise)…. we have the knowledge. We can, and if you are people in Cyprus or other involved in Germany:<br>You can just do this in your cities and in your towns. We can go out and feed these people at no cost.<br>凯史：作为一个家庭，一个国家，和一个星球。我们必须做出回应，我们不能……（噪音）……我们拥足够的知识。我们可以，如果你来自塞浦路斯或者德国的人：<br>你可以在你所在的的城市和城镇中这样做。我们解决这些人的温饱问题而不花费一分钱。</p>
<p>R : Ok! I have got it lined up here Mr Keshe.<br>瑞克：弄好了，我的把它放在这里。</p>
<p>MK : Then go public with it ! Read it because you are the reader !<br>凯史：你为我们读一读吧。</p>
<p>R : It says…<br>瑞克：邮件是这样写的……</p>
<p>MK : Can you put it in public ? Because we only see the planet.<br>凯史：你能把内容张贴在桌面上吗？</p>
<p>R : OK! Let me copy and put it in the application. Here we go !<br>瑞克：好的，我先复制一下然后粘贴在应用上，弄好了！</p>
<p>MK : We have received a large number of these people asking the Foundation to respond and now, we have the technology. We are responding. In a way, what is going to be discussed this afternoon is totally … will keyed up.to the food, cycle of food and how we can feed each other. This is the development in the Space Technology which Keshe Foundation Team, in the background, in differents bits, have been doing in past two years and we brought the teams together to complete it. And now, it’s been completed…<br>Is that information gathered. Can you read it please ?<br>凯史：许多人要求凯史基金会回应他们的请求，我们有足够的技术可以帮助他们处理这些问题。我们也正在给予回应。今天下午我们将要讨论的是……如何用食物单元的解决人类的食物问题。在过去2年凯史基金会在幕后和一些团队共同一直在研发新的食物系统，现在我们成功了……<br>找到那些邮件了吗？你给我们念一下吧。</p>
<p>00:25:00</p>
<p>Rick: Ok, it says:<br>“Carolina, I ask for your help, here in Greece there are thousands and thousands of Syrian immigrants coming every day. Those people come from a country full of war, starving, afraid, with no hope at all.<br>I want to help them eat but I don’t have enough food for all of them, how can I ease their hunger? How can i help them not starve to death. I don’t know how I can use this technology to feed man, is there anyone that can teach me, please? Thank you!”<br>瑞克：我来读一下：<br>“卡若琳，我请你的帮帮我们，在希腊每天有成千上万的叙利亚移民涌入。这些人来自一个充满战争、饥饿、恐惧的国家，对他们来说生活毫无希望可言。<br>我想帮助他们，但我没有足够的食物，我该怎么帮助他们缓解饥饿？我该怎么做，他们才能不饿死。我不知道该怎么用凯史科技帮助他们，你能教教我吗？谢谢你！”</p>
<p>Feeding the World at No Cost and Without Harming Any Other Living Entity<br>在不伤害其他生命，不花费一分钱的情况下解决世界上的温饱问题。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:Today, we are going to teach you!.Today we are going to open the door!<br>凯史：今天，我们要教给你们新的科技；今天人类将步入新科技的大门！</p>
<p>Because today it’s Cyprus, … in a few days or weeks time or months time there will be another earthquake in China, in America, whatever, … Hurricanes in another part.<br>因为今天是塞浦路斯……在一段时间内，中国、美国等其他国家要发生地震……其他地方还会有飓风。</p>
<p>And now that we have the knowledge, we share it!<br>This is a major breakthrough in the world of Food. And it’ll be in the world of Health.<br>现在我们有了新的科技知识，并在今天向世界！<br>在解决世界性的饥饿问题有了重大突破，还有能保证每一个人健康的医疗装置。</p>
<p>Let me give you a background how it comes about:<br>The human body, as we said, in the space will respond only to magnetic fields.<br>The human body in the space will only absorb energy in a magnetic field strength.<br>下面我要向大家讲解其原理：<br>在太空中人体只对磁场有反应。<br>太空中的人体只能吸收磁场能量。</p>
<p>We will not see fields of cows and we will not see fields of herds of sheeps and … äh what you call apple trees and orchards of whatever.<br>It will be the pictures which we will carry into space. But the reality will be that we only be able to absorb energies from our environment.<br>我们看不到场奶牛，成群的绵羊……也看不到苹果树和果园。<br>我们能带进太空的只是它们的照片。但现实是，我们只能从环境中吸收能量。</p>
<p>We won’t have man going to space with truckloads of food on the trailer. Carrying tins and food and the only thing we will carry is ourselves.<br>我们不能将成堆的罐头和食物带入太空。我们唯一能带入太空的就是自己。</p>
<p>Our body will change. As I have explained before. In so many ways everything about us will change.<br>人体会发生变化。</p>
<p>In the space, as we don’t have animals to eat, and we go into the cycle of change of absorbing energy we will lose all our digestion system.<br>We will lose the storage system for the minerals and everything else [what] we call liver.<br>We will lose more or less our recycling system what we call kidneys.<br>As the stomach changes because you’re absorbing energy there is nothing to go through it to convert energy, the size of the brain of the man changes because most of the brain of the man, the size of it, on the outer section of [the] brain is just for running these systems internally.<br>在太空中，没有食物为人体提供能量，从而人体进入了吸收能量的变化周期，人体将失去所有的消化系统。<br>人体会失去矿物质的储存系统，比如肝脏。<br>人体也会失去回收系统，比如肾脏。<br>因为不再进食，胃也会产生变化。大脑的尺寸也会改变，因为大脑的外部负责在人体内部运行这些系统。</p>
<p>The benefit with this will be: Cancer will not exist.<br>Because there are no organs to get or to create cancer.<br>We hardly get cancer on our shin or on our upper leg. We don’t get usually. It’s very rare if we do.<br>So even the bone cancers we see is because it’s initiated by the digestion system.<br>人体的改变带来的益处：癌症将不复存在。<br>因为没有器官会被癌症侵蚀或制造出癌症。<br>人类的胫骨或后小腿通常不会染上癌症。<br>所以骨肿瘤是由消化系统所引发的。</p>
<p>In this process we will come to one point:<br>In time, when we lose our digestion system, and we come to the point that our emotion allows to release its hidden problem for years, for centuries, for millions of years, which we physically wanted to eat the animal, but the emotion could hear the emotion of the animal which we are consuming.<br>在这个过程中，人体将达到一个状态：<br>当人体失去消化系统时，人类的多年来的情感得以释放，而这些情感则是人体患病的隐患。几百万年来，人类的物理身体总有吃动物的欲望，但是人的情感体能听到被杀动物的哀嚎。</p>
<p>And it was not happy with it.<br>So in that process we will see the total change in the behaviour of man. Sereneness calm, peaceful man.<br>Because now our Emotion and Physicality come very close to each other. There is no conflict.<br>慢慢的人类的行为将彻底改变。人会变得非常平静，安宁，和平。<br>现在人体的感情体和肉体彼此非常接近，没有冲突。</p>
<p>In this process, as we start absorbing energy, through our GANS of our matter which is our body, we lose the need to breathe air. Air is the signature of this planet.<br>We have created lung to absorb vast energy for our emotion.<br>Now that we are in the space and we don’t need to eat, because we have found an alternative way to absorb energy, we lose our lung.<br>在这个过程中，人体开始吸收巨大的情感能量，而不需要呼吸空气。<br>在太空中，人体吸收能量而不需要食物，最终肺也会消失。</p>
<p>Because now we take what we need at the time we need. The size of our heart will reduce drastically. And lung will be non existent.<br>我们的心脏将变得更小，肺将消失。</p>
<p>This is part of the process when we absorb energy from our environment.<br>这是我们从环境中吸取能量过程的一部分。</p>
<p>00:30:00<br>This is why in all the teachings in past years I always said, what we eat is 20% of what we need. We absorb 80% from our environment.<br>就像我过去常常提到的，人体只能从食物中摄取20%的能量，80%的能量是从周围环境中获取的。</p>
<p>That’s why you have aura.  The aura you see is not just what goes out, what goes out has to be absorbed in too.  So, you see it’s both ways, it’s a circulating aura, it’s a circulating magnetic field, what we don’t need we give to the environment, what the environment wants to give us.  You always assume the aura is what the body stands and shows, [instead] the aura is attraction of your body with its environment, gravitational-magnetic.<br>人人都有灵气。灵气不仅仅只人看到的外部部分，这些外部的灵气也会被吸收。这是是一个循环磁场，人体会把多余能量释放给环境。灵气不单单是身体的表现，更是能够从环境和磁引力场中吸收能量。</p>
<p>So, in this process as we lose, or we do with digestion system, we do with our lung, in this process we come to a new dimension:<br>在这个转换过程中，人体会失去消化系统，呼吸系统，但会迈入一个新的维度：</p>
<p>We become detached from matter-state of this planet.<br>Which means we lose our connection with inertia.<br>我们会与这个星球的物质状态分离。<br>这意味着我们失去了与惯性的连接。</p>
<p>Because our body works through the GANS-state, not the matter-state.  As in all the teachings, I have explained, the structure of this planet is magnetic-gravitational, which comes from the centre, from the interaction of the matters inside, the fields inside. And the inertia, which is gravitational-magnetic field of the matter-state of this planet.<br>因为人体是通过甘斯状态运行，而不是物质状态。地球是由地球内部的物质相互作用所产生的磁性引力场构成的。</p>
<p>Now that we stop absorbing, consuming matter-state, our energy level will only be on magnetic-gravitational level, we become detached from this planet in the process of our living.  In this process we go to the next step when we become ….<br>人体会停止从物质中吸收能量，并且人体的能量水平会停留在磁引力场水平，在生命的进程中会与地球分离。在这个过程中，我们会进行下一步，当我们成为……</p>
<p> (sound coming in from elsewhere)<br>There is a microphone open in the background, please! … When we become detached … There is a microphone open, please! … … … [someone in the background shouting “Michael, Michael…”]<br>（从别处传来的声音）<br>有别的麦克风干扰，请……当我们与地球分离时………怎么还有其他麦克风 干扰呢？[有人在喊：“米迦勒，米迦勒的背景…”]</p>
<p>When we become detached from the matter-state, or the inertia, then we become man of Space, we operate, we receive, and we give, we think, and we live through the true dimension of magnetical-gravitational system.<br>当我们从物质状态或惯性产生分离时，我们就成了一个太空人。通过真正的磁引力系统维度，我们合作，接受，给予，思考，生活。</p>
<p>In that process, then we become correct, we become just, because now we only can give what we don’t need, and it’s correct to us, and we take as we need.<br>在这个过程中，我们会变得理智、公正，因为现在我们只会给予自身多余的东西，而在今后我们会正确地给予和索取。</p>
<p>So, the main problem of man’s existence on this planet, we see how it comes to an end so quickly after 50, 60, 100 years with cancer, with lung, and with other things, now it’s not there, man becomes immortal, man can live for hundreds of years, thousands of years.<br>More or less, we become to live as long as a planet or a star can live, it’s us or accidents who will determine when we want to terminate the life, or not life but the composition we are in at this moment, or the shape we are taking.<br>50、60、100年后癌症、肺癌和其它的疾病都将消失，人类可以永生不死，寿命长达几百年，几千年。<br>我们的寿命会变得像行星或恒星一样长，寿命的长短和生命形式会由我们自己决定（自己决定什么时候死，决定自己物理身体的形式）。</p>
<p>Over the past two years, over past ten years, I have written, and I have directed you, in this path, where the man will start losing his digestion system. Where the man will start receiving food from the environment without eating food. Where the system will allow man to live independent of the shackles of Earth chain supply of energy.<br>过去2年、10年里，我已经指引人们开始走向这条道路，最终人类的消化系统将消失。人类将不用吃任何食物。食物系统将使人类摆脱生活的束缚，摆脱地球食物链链的能量供应。</p>
<p>And I have a news for you, we have achieved that system, the Keshe Foundation Spaceship Unit and Innovation Unit have achieved and have been testing this unit for the past few days.  We are not testing with one, we are testing with a number of people involved, and they are taking their initiative to test other things.  So, this is the news we have for you today.<br>我有个消息要告诉大家，这个系统已经成功研制，凯史基金会的太空学院和创新学院已在过去的几天里就已经开始测试新的食物系统。我们不只测试一台装置测试，而是由一批人自发地进行测试，并且人们还参与了其他系统的测试。</p>
<p>The systems, which we will discuss later on today, is the beginning of the structure of the first man to be taken into Space.<br>If you go to Space the way you have done up till now you need to carry food, .<br>今天我们将讨论的食物系统，是今后第一个被带进太空的装置。<br>而直到今天，进入太空人们还需要携带食物，..</p>
<p>00:35:00<br>… we see what happens to the astronauts, we need to be covered.</p>
<p>We’ve seen what happens to those.<br>……现在我们知道了宇航员进入太空后身体会发生什么变化。</p>
<p>Now, the Keshefoundation WORLDWIDE as ONE Nation, ONE Planet, ONE Race we have achieved and are testing this phenomenon.<br>凯史基金会本着一个国家，一个地球，一个民族的宗旨，已经完成了了新系统的研发，而且正在进行测试。</p>
<p>So what happens because you use your digestion system, you don’t need to go to toilet any more the way you are used to. Because there is nothing there to go through. You get energy and you leave energy.<br>And we are monitoring the volunteers in that way. If they go to toilet. And is there any difference?<br>We are monitoring that if they ate, the reason they ate and how they eat.<br>消化系统和排泄系统都会消失后，人们就再也不用上厕所了。<br>我们也在监控志愿者。是什么差异导致他们想去厕所呢？<br>监测他们想吃食物的原因以及他们如何去吃的。</p>
<p>The process of conversion into the man of the space takes about 6 months.<br>So, in the next 6 to 12 months, amongst you and you yourself most probably will start the process.<br>人们从吃饭到转变为从环境和磁引力场中吸取能量需要大约6个月的时间。<br>所以，在接下来的6到12个月里，你很有可能会开始体验这个过程。</p>
<p>All of you have the technology in your hands!<br>All of you have the knowledge in your hands!<br>所有的技术都在你们手中！<br>所有的知识都在你们手中！</p>
<p>I have trained you and a lot of you have followed the procedure. We have made man independent of the food chain.<br>And this is the reason why you have this on your screen:<br>很多人经过我们的训练而遵循这样一个程序。我们已经使人脱离食物链。</p>
<p>“How can I help them not to starve to death?”<br>“我怎么才能不让他们饿死呢？”“</p>
<p>By the end of this program the Keshefoundation Cyprus, people who are active in Cyprus: Just follow our procedure. We put you the people who have built the system to tell you how to do it … and you follow it.<br>那些活跃在塞浦路斯的凯史基金会成员：只要按照我们的程序。我们会告诉你如何建立这些食物系统……你们按照我们说的去做。</p>
<p>Put one system in every square!<br>Put one system in every mosque!<br>在每一个广场上放置一个食物系统！<br>在每一个清真寺放置一个食物系统！</p>
<p>These are Syrians, they are Muslims. They are as faithful to god as the christians.<br>Open the churches and put these systems in the church and invite them in!<br>这些叙利亚难民都是穆斯林，像基督徒一样忠实于神。<br>在教堂里放置这些食物系统，并邀请他们进来！</p>
<p>And you will find out: You will feed them at cost of nothing!<br>你会发现：不用花费任何东西就可以救活他们！</p>
<p>They can come every day to the mosque, they can come every day to the church and eat what they want, drink what they want, take medicine what they want and walk away with joy.<br>他们能每天来到清真寺，来到教堂，能随便吃喝任何自己喜欢的东西，并且浑身洋溢快乐和富足。</p>
<p>This is the way we bring peace to humanity.<br>这就是凯史基金会为人类带来和平的方式。</p>
<p>The system is very easy:<br>You think of what you like to have and you receive the energy according to what you need from that food.<br>You will taste the food. You will feel the food. You will receive the energy of the food and you will receive the Emotion and the Pleasures of eating it. At the same time, you receive all the energy.<br>Which means you do not need till the next time.<br>When you go to the system, and you give what you don’t need and it takes from you what you don’t need and exchange. [ The system gives you what you need and you take what you need ].<br>Hundreds of people can go to the same post, to the same system.<br>制作这个食物系统很容易：<br>根据自己的喜好，就可以通过食物获得所需的能量。<br>你可以品尝食物，感受食物，获得食物的能量。你的情感也会得到满足，享受到食物带给你的快乐和。沉浸快乐幸福的同时，得到所有的能量。<br>并且能量会保持充沛直到下一次进食。<br>食物系统给予你需要的能量。<br>一个食物系统可以同时供养数百人。</p>
<p>One likes fish and chips, one likes rice.<br>We can’t get all the kebabs the Syrians love.<br>Muslim’s …what you want … Hummus is hard to get to feed thousands of people, but they can all have Hummus for a starter, they can have their kebab and their rice and (gluco???) or whatever they enjoy.<br>You bring the hungry Christians. They like to have from the same post pork. [They] like to have a bacon.<br>Where the Muslims eat out of the same thing hallal meat.<br>You bring the Jews and let them eat kosher food from the post.<br>You all receive what is your ethos. Because in the space, we are ONE.<br>You bring the vegetarians and they eat vegetarian.<br>食物系统可以为叙利亚难民，穆斯林，基督徒，犹太人提供所有他们各自爱吃的特色食物。<br>我们是同一个民族。</p>
<p>To you this is the dream. But in fact I showed you these in the peace conference in Rome. And you were all blind to it.<br>In the conference, Peace Conference in Rome I put a 120V/110V American drill with a 220V/240V European drill and a DC [ on one and the same plug ]!<br>You have seen it, but you’re so narrow minded to Energy, you could not see the other side of it.<br>This is, what it is: The MAGRAV Systems, which give You, what You need!<br>这听起来像天方夜谭。我曾在罗马和平会议上向人们展示过这些，但那时人们都觉得这是不可能的。<br>罗马和平会议上展示的能量单元可以同时适用于美国地120V / 110V电压频率，欧洲的220V/240V的电压频率和直流电。<br>人们见识到了能量单元但还是不能突破传统观念接受它。<br>现在人们要擦亮眼睛：由能量单元构成的食物系统将会给予每一个人想要的任何东西！</p>
<p>AC, DC, … you want to have a Kebab? You want a kosher meat? You want a barbecue? You want to have a bacon in the morning an egg?<br>You decide what your body needs … You will receive it in the taste, You like!<br>You receive Omega 3 from a cow and you receive …<br>交流电，直流电……不论烤肉串，烧烤，还是培根加蛋等任何美食，食物系统都可以满足你。<br>身体的需求由你决定……享受美味。<br>一头奶牛可以提供给你（译者：不明白Omega 3 from a cow是什么意思）……你收到……</p>
<p>00:40:00<br>… leg of the fish from the beef. If you understand what is the “leg of the fish”.<br>……如果你明白什么是“鱼的腿”（译者：不好意思，我不明白“leg of the fish”是什么意思）。</p>
<p>So, you have seen the system. But you were so narrow minded that you could not see it.<br>This system is developed for the space. Because in the space, we take what we need when we need.<br>食物系统已经摆在人们眼前，但人们仍旧视若无睹。<br>食物系统是为了人类步入太空而研发的。</p>
<p>But I warn you:<br>When you start placing theses systems into these churches, the mosques, the central square … you will find out: The city will change.<br>The city will change to [a] land of Peace. Because there is no more … you satisfy the hunger.<br>The city will change into a place of collaboration. Because now man [will] see each other as friend.<br>In that position we don’t see a need for arms.<br>In a way with what we release today we start the disarmament under the condition of the Keshe Foundation.<br>ONE Planet, ONE Nation, ONE Race.<br>但我提醒你：<br>当食物系统被放置到教堂、清真寺、中心广场时……整个城市将会发生改变。<br>城市将会变得和平。因为没有更多的……满足饥饿。<br>城市里人们会相互友爱合作。<br>那时所有的武器会被淘汰。<br>在凯史基金会创造的和平环境下，各国政府会大量裁军。<br>一个地球，一个国家，一个种族。</p>
<p>You have seen this technology, what is about to come, what is going to be shown and the people who are testing it will testify it, not us. And in so many ways by tonight most of you who have worked on that line should be able to walk into the churches and put these systems up and tell the priest: “This is my blood. And this is my body. You will taste it both.”<br>And we’ll see who will like to taste the blood.<br>随着测试的进行和完成，我们会把食物系统展示给大家。从今晚开始任何有能力制作食物单元的人都应该走进教堂，把食物系统介绍给牧师：“这是我的血。这是我的身体。你会尝到它的味道。”（译者：因为凯史先生喜欢抒情，这句“This is my blood. And this is my body. You will taste it both.” 不好意思我实在不清楚它的意思。）</p>
<p>You can not wish it for the others. You only receive what your body needs and what is your emotion.<br>不能向他人索取能量，只能从本身的情感获得能量。</p>
<p>With the teaching of today we start the process of the Peace by changing man.<br>We warn you and you always … I’m very good in putting you in one foot [and] while you are busy, setting the next steps for you to walk in.<br>在今天的教学中，我们通过改变人类进而开始和平进程的推进。</p>
<p>All of you who made the new MAGRAV condition: You can start feeding your nation.<br>所有制造出食物系统的人都可以供养周围的人们。</p>
<p>All of you who made these MAGRAV systems:<br>Don’t do anything to it. Just put it in the back of your car and park your car somewhere.<br>And just walk around and tell people: “Would you like some soup?”<br>They say “Yes!”<br>They say: “Have it!”<br>You’ll see them, they feel the soup. They eat the soup. They taste the soup.<br>You don’t need to carry anything with you.<br>Leave the box and tell them: “Whenever you come here you wish in this square: Your wish will come true!”<br>举个例子：<br>把车停在某个地方，然后把食物系统放在车后备箱里。<br>这样就可以为路人提供免费的热汤。<br>然后你可以告诉人们：不论你们想吃什么，这里通通都免费提供。</p>
<p>Take the crosses from the churches and put these systems on it.<br>You feed the whole neighborhood. No child needs to go hungry into bed.<br>Go to the priest and say “We exchange freedom of the man from physicality to a cross”.<br>把食物系统放在教堂的十字架上。<br>可以为整个街区解决温饱问题。再也没有孩子会饿着肚子睡觉。</p>
<p>Do the same thing with the Star of David.<br>同样可以把食物系统放在大卫之星上。</p>
<p>And do the same thing with the mosques.<br>把食物系统放在清真寺里。</p>
<p>See which priest will object and refuse. And if he doesn’t believe it, tell him: “You wish what you want to eat. You will taste it!”<br>如果有哪一个牧师不相信，那就告诉他：“你想要吃什么，一会你的愿望就会实现。”</p>
<p>But the beauty of it is. … You’ve seen it, when you saw the orange on the cup. And you put the amino-acid on one side, you put the CO2 on one side, you put the water inside and you drank the water.<br>这就是食物单元的美妙之处……把桔子放在盛水的杯子上，氨基酸和CO2各放在杯子一边，那你喝到的是无比美妙的水。</p>
<p>My fellow man:<br>The amino-acid is your body! The water is 80% of what [your body] is the container of.<br>The CO2 is part of existence of its neuro-system.<br>Now you see when you make the system: You are the cup!<br>同胞们啊，你们要知道，身体是由氨基酸组成的，人体的80%是水。<br>CO2甘斯是构成神经系统的一部分。<br>这个杯子不就是和人体差不多吗！</p>
<p>And you receive what you wish, what you need from the system.<br>Now you see … you know it all … now you see it’s just putting the chicks/jigs/eggs [(00:44:46)???] all together.<br>You put the oranges and you taste the orange and the cucumber. The amino-acid, …<br>从食物系统中你可以获得想要的任何东西、能量。<br>现在……现在你只是把小鸡/夹具/鸡蛋[（00:44:46）？？？放在一起。（译者：因为红色部分的英文脚本缺失太多，而且内容不重要，是凯史先生在抒情，所以翻译得不是很准确，小鸡，鸡蛋之类的）<br>你把桔子放进去，那么会尝到橘子和黄瓜的味道。氨基酸……</p>
<p>00:45:00<br>the CO2, CH3 … is You!<br>CO2甘斯和CH3甘斯……这就是是你啊！</p>
<p>You are the Cup of Life!<br>Now it’s you who needs to take what is allowed, what is needed by you according to your existence and no more.<br>人体本身就是一个生命之杯！<br>你需要的能量要仅由你的生命形式而定。</p>
<p>If you made the coils, … if you made the cores and if you managed to make the GANS:<br>Today is your freedom from the life of physicality!<br>如果你制做线圈……如果你制作了甘斯球和甘斯：那今天你就脱离了肉体的束缚，你自由了！<br>No man should die of cancer. Because in a few weeks time you will find: People will not go hungry. They go to the post and you see them chew.<br>Tell them: “You like a steak? You get the feel of the steak. Chew the steak.”<br>The noise of the gum [ (00:45:59) ] will satisfy the emotion of the satisfaction.<br>将没有人死于癌症。因为在几周之内你会发现：人们将没有饥饿。他们去到邮局之后你会看见他们在咀嚼。<br>You saw Alekz getting drunk with the water. And a lot of you tested this. So, you know this.<br>你瞧Alekz 喝那个水就醉了。你们做了许多的测试，你们知道这个。<br>There are a team of about 11/12 people in a close circle of the Keshefoundation who have been involved in this test, in this trial plus 6 people from totally outside the Foundation who came in to test but conected to the man who’s built it.<br>At this moment all of you can build it by tonight.<br>在凯史基金会有一个11到12人的团队在做这个闭合线圈装置的测试，再加上今天6个非凯史基金会的人加入到这个实验，但是先联系到那个建造它的人。<br>今天晚上你们立即就可以制作它。<br>If you are not the man of rope like what we saw and I explained you: Vatican.<br>If you go to Vatican in this most beautiful richest block white building, you just walk 10 meters on the border of the Vatican. You see men and women after 6 o’clock in boxes.<br>The biggest house in the world who claims the most houses owners<br>churches has thousands of people sleeping on the street, hungry. Within 10 meters from its walls.<br>如果你不是和那个人一伙的，例如我们看见的我来给你解释：梵蒂冈。<br>如果你去梵蒂冈走近那个漂亮豪华的白色建筑，在罗马教廷的围墙之外仅仅走十米，你就会看很多见男人和女人在6个小时之后住在箱子里。<br>谁赋予他们权力成为这个全世界最大的房子的主人，当世界上还有成千上万的露宿街头的人，饥饿的人，就在这个围墙之外十米的地方。<br>Now take one of these systems into the center of Vatican and leave it there. And you will see: You don’t find any beggars. Because they don’t need to beg their food. They are there to receive it directly as they need. Then you will see people start bending and praying not to the white building in the back … because he hasn’t given anything to them but has taken everything from them … to the system you leave in the middle of the square in Vatican.<br>现在拿一个装置进入梵蒂冈的中心然后离开那里，然后你会发现：你在也找不到任何乞丐，因为它们再也不需要乞求食物，它们在那里立即接受到正好它们所需要的。然后你将看见人民开始俯首祈祷在后面不要再有这个白色的建筑。因为他没有给予人民任何东西而从人民那里拿走所有东西……梵蒂冈的统治者，请你离开这个广场的中心。<br>We change the “House of God” to freedom of the man.<br>That was never the “House of God”. That was the house to abuse the gods.<br>I told you a couple of years ago: I will return the stones of the<br>Colosseum back to the Colosseum<br>我们改变“上帝的居所”，还给人类自由。<br>那个绝对不是“上帝的居所”。那是亵渎众神的居所。<br>我几年前就告诉过你们：我将投掷石头使罗马斗兽场回到罗马斗兽场。<br>We have a huge support in Italy. We have a factory in Italy.<br>Understand the way we teach today and take these units across Italy. No one should sleep hungry.<br>We will release the cores, you can buy the cores individually from the factory that you can mass produce, mass release systems which is not the energy but the coils which are for the food.<br>In the next day or two we release these in mass on the Keshefoundation website.<br>We make it in a way affordable for anyone to buy and start feeding<br>themselves and their families.<br>我们得到意大利很大的支持，我们在意大利建立了工厂。<br>今天我们教会你们的这个线圈装置，我们将拿到意大利进行生产。日以继夜。<br>我们将发布核心，你可以从工厂购买单个核心单元，也可以组织批量生产。大规模地发售但这个不是能量单元而是食物单元。<br>在接下来的几天我们将把这个放到基金会的网站上。<br>我们的产品将是任何人都可以负担得起的并可以立即和他们的家庭来共同感受的。<br>The way we saw reduction in the electricity bills for the families, 60%/30% that they have more now to spend … we will see people who have enough money to do whatever else because their food is there.<br>我们通过减少家庭的电费支出60%或30%，现在他们可以有更多的消费能力……我们想要看看人们在有了更多的钱财的时候要做些什么，因为他们不缺食物。<br>But there is one position with this:<br>Once you start using theses systems for eating, for energy, you will start becoming a man of the Space, man of Peace.<br>You will not feel like eating and you will not feel like taking energy by wasting another life.<br>So we prepare man to become “Man of the Space”.<br>但是这里有一个态度问题：<br>一旦你开始使用这些装置获得食物，能量，你将成为一个和平的人。<br>你不能把其他可爱的生命拿来当成你们的食物那样吃掉。</p>
<p>第二部分<br>00:50:00<br>(Keshe) You will find out that a lot of features you will change. And when you speak about Peace, the emotion and the feeling of the Peace will radiate from you, because they can see the change.<br>凯史：你将会发现——你改变的诸多征象，当你谈论和平，那种和平的情感和感觉将从身上放射出来，因为他们能看见你的变化。</p>
<p>You’ll know this how to make these systems all by yourself. We have been through it. I started this process on the 26th of November when I showed you the first power unit.<br>你将知道你自己怎样来制作所有这些系统，我们经历过了。我11月26日第一次向你们展示这个能量单元，就开始了这个进程。</p>
<p>You were so hungry for energy , that you like sheep, walked into the slaughterhouse of today to become man of peace.<br>I didn’t take you to kill you by teaching you. I took you to show you the freedom that you can live for hundreds of years.<br>你们过去对能量如此饥饿，你们象绵羊一样走进屠宰场，今天，你们成为和平的人。<br>我没有通过我的教学让你们自杀，我向你们展示自由，让你们能活数百年。</p>
<p>Now, the choice is yours.<br>Those who do not want to receive the energy do not go to the church. This is the Church of God. This is the Church of Equality. This is a Mosque of Peace.<br>现在，选择在你。<br>那些不想接收能量，不想去教堂的人们，这里是上帝的教堂，这里是平等的教堂，这里是和平的清真寺。</p>
<p>Those American armies from NATO and the rest who have been trying to bomb Syria and the rest: Please bomb them, but with the coils we give you. Drop these, carpet bomb the way you did in what you call it, Vietnam? Carpet bomb the whole of Syria with these units.<br>那些北约的美军以及那些试图轰炸叙利亚和其它国家的军队们，请用我给你们的这些线圈轰炸他们，落下这些线圈，地毯式轰炸，用你们在越南的方式，地毯式轰炸整个叙利亚，用这些单元。</p>
<p>You’ll find out the man is not hungry, his behavior changes, he leaves the con on the road and he walks. We have finished with the wars.<br>你将发现那里人不再饥饿，他的行为改变了，他不再反抗，他在路上漫步。我们已经结束了战争。</p>
<p>Today is the 9th of February and within a month, you can change the course of humanity. The 9th of March. Within one month you can change.<br>今天是2月9日，一个月内，你们能改变人类的历程，3月9日，一个月内，你们能改变。</p>
<p>We have a huge support in the Middle East. My friends, build the cores. Keshe Foundation in Italy is on a full blast just producing coils that you can have. And, we’ll get the full support from Iranians covering the street produce as much as we can.<br>Carpet bomb Syria, please do, with the Magrav systems. They don’t need anything. You’ll see the structure.<br>在中东我们有巨大的支持力量，我的朋友们制作核心，意大利凯史基金会集中全力生产线圈，这些线圈你能得到，我们还将得到伊朗人的全面支持，覆盖大街小巷进行生产，尽我们的能力。<br>请吧，轰炸叙利亚，用磁引力系统，他们不需要任何东西，你将看见这个装置。</p>
<p>The man who built it are here today to tell you how they built it and they tell you how they feel since past three, four days since they started it.<br>There should be no child going hungry anywhere in the world if we carpet bomb with the American B52s and the rest of the whole of the world with Magrav systems. These are energy units the way they are built and they start working on their own.<br>今天在这里制造这些单元的人，告诉你他们怎样制造，他们还告诉你从他们开始以来这三、四天的感觉。<br>世界各地将不会有孩子挨饿，如果我们用磁引力系统来对全世界进行地毯式的轰炸，用美国B52运输机。这些是能量单元，他们制造，他们开始制作，尽他们自己的力量。</p>
<p>Remember, in doing so, we start a huge change. You will lose your voice, that’s for sure.<br>Because, when there is no need for the stomach, the mouth will shut.<br>Then, you will see why I deliberately released the teaching last week of interaction of the emotion. You will see the truth about each other without a single word spoken.<br>记住，这样做，我们启动了一次巨大的转变，你们将丢失你们的声音，这是确定的。<br>因为，当不需要胃，嘴将闭上。<br>然后，你将明白为什么我上周谨慎地释放关于情感交互的教学，不说一个字你将看见彼此之间的真实。</p>
<p>Now you see energy is irrelevant, because if your plan was to warm yourself, that you could eat something, that you could stand the frost of the winter, the system will give you. You will learn to be camouflaged. You will learn to take energy and give energy at the rate you want. You will perfect the art of becoming a man of space.<br>现在，你看到能量不是问题，因为，如果你只想温暖你自己，你吃些东西，你就可以在冬季站在严寒中，系统可以给予你，你将学习被掩护，你将学习按你的比例摄取能量和给予能量。你将成就太空人类的完美艺术。</p>
<p>And now that you done that and now in the next few weeks and months, when the man achieves his detachment from physicality, you will find out your space ships will fly, because it doesn’t work in a matter-state, but it will work in a plasma GANS state.<br>现在，你完成了，在接下来的几周，几个月，当人类实现从他的肉身分离，你会发现你的太空船将会起飞，因为，它不工作在物质状态，他将工作在等离子体甘斯状态。</p>
<p>54:58<br>What I am telling you now, I have be teaching the team last night for an hour or two (whatever it took). So those ten people who were in that meeting, they are here. Repetition plus more, because they had to be ready, to be ready for today.<br>我现在告诉你什么呢，昨晚我对团队进行一到二小时的教学（无论什么），在那会上的十个人，他们在这里，再重复多说一次，因为他们已经准备好了，为今天准备好了。</p>
<p>In the upcoming changes, man will not touch.<br>You know you used to go and you used to put things somewhere to go “trick-or-treat” [in America, children go from house to house and say “trick-or-treat” to get some sweets], to make a box and leave them around and play “trick-or-treat” with the peace.<br>即将到来的改变，人们将不须接触。<br>你知道，你们习惯，习惯于把东西放在某处，然后玩“trick-or-treat”游戏[原注：美国游戏，孩子们一间一间的房屋寻找，说着“trick（骗子）-or-treat（招待）”，然后找到事先放置的甜食]，做一个盒子，离开盒子，然后玩“trick-or-treat”游戏，找到和平。</p>
<p>I will tell you one thing, for sure a lot of trees will bless you. Because now that you have no waste, there is no need for papers in the toilets. You get the blessing of the vertical animals.<br>我将告诉你们一件事情，确实有许多树将护佑你，因为现在，你不再消耗，盥洗室不需要用纸，你得到了[树]对直立动物的护佑。</p>
<p>And as you don’t eat, you don’t slaughter a sheep or a lamb and you have a blessing of their soul, too. But the question is, would the sheep and the lamb change as you are putting these systems on?<br>They are 95%, 99% the as same as us. Would the lion stop eating? Would the wolf will stop eating? But would the wolf will  learn by thinking will receive maybe the minute he feels  hungry and think of a sheep to eat, he has already received the energy there is no sheep to eat.<br>因为你不吃，你不再屠杀绵羊和羔羊，你现在也得到了那些灵魂的保佑。但是问题是，你也给绵羊和羔羊安置系统让他们和你一样改变吗？<br>它们95%，99%和我们是一样的，狮子停止吃吗？狼停止吃吗？狼将会学习思考吗？在它感到饥饿的那一分钟，或许它要思考吃羊的问题，他已经接收到能量，不需要吃羊。</p>
<p>In so many ways, we have completed the promise of blesses Christ: The two animals, the hunter and the hunted will sleep in the same nest.<br>从多方面，我们已经完成了祝福基督的承诺：那两种动物——猎人和猎物在同一个巢穴内睡觉。</p>
<p>We can not go and fight armies to stop, we can not fight head of the states with their only ambition is to be called Mr. President. But we can give enough that nobody goes under arms so there is no head of army, because we are the army of human race.<br>我们不能用武力来停止军队，我们不能攻击国家元首，他们唯一的野心是想被人称呼“总统先生”。但是，我们可以给予足够多，没有人去武器下面，没有人去统帅军队，因为，我们是人类种族的军队。</p>
<p>The beauty with this is:<br>The faster we go through it, the faster we become ready to take into space.<br>美妙之处在于：<br>我们越快通过这个进程，我们就越快准备好进入太空。</p>
<p>A lot of you kept on telling me: “We have to save the human race, all of it.”<br>Now this is your chance. Save all of it. Change them with simple systems into energy users of the atmosphere by losing their digestion system. They all become detached from the physicality of the earth, and so they all become ready to become passengers of the universe.<br>你们许多人持续告诉我：“我们必须拯救全人类”。<br>现在，这是你们的机会。拯救全人类，用简单的系统改变他们，放弃消化系统，成为大气中的能量使用者。只有他们全部都从这个地球上的物理身体分离，他们才准备好成为宇宙的乘客。</p>
<p>That in the [???calm/coming???], the time, that the accidents of different shape of form, [for example the] approaching of the 2nd sun will come: The man who wanted to be will be in the space.<br>Far enough that no field interaction of the [???clusion???] of the two stars will ever reached.<br>在[接下来的]时间，不同类型的事故，[比如]正在接近的第二太阳将来到，人类想要进入太空。<br>[……]足够远，没有场的互动，二个恒星总要到达。<br>In the process of development, you will learn the next step: To change the units and the [???pulse/bulbs] you have here, to the units and the [???pulse/bulbs] in the space.<br>You become immortal.<br>Man always wanted to live, now we have given you the reasons, we have given you the tools and we show you the path.<br>在这个发展进程中，你将学习下一步：改变那些单元，你这里的[???]，在太空中的[???]，对这些单元。<br>你们变成不会死的。<br>人类总想活下去，现在，我们已经给你们理由，已经给你们工具，我们还给你们展示道路。</p>
<p>I am the creator, and I stand by my word.<br>As I said, in my name I deliver, and I have delivered. And I will see every man off in the correct way. As is my wish.<br>我就是造物主，我说到做到。<br>我说过，以我的名公布，而且我已经公布过，我将看着每一个人以正确的方式离开。这是我的愿望。</p>
<p>59:21<br>You got to realize, those of you who built this systems to try which is going to be shown today: You have become a passenger of the space!<br>There is no return!<br>Once you lock into these systems, there is no going back. It’s like the mother, and their milk of cord which is cut but they are still connected.<br>It’s taken me a long time to walk all of you in the same path.<br>你们实现了，今天你们那些制作这个系统的人们，试图进行展示：你们已经成为太空乘客！<br>没有回头路！<br>一旦你锁定这些系统，就没有退转的路。就象妈妈，虽然断奶了，但他们还是连接着。<br>我花了很长的时间走过你们这同一条道路。</p>
<p> We have over 3-4 hundred millions followers and listeners across the world.This is significant number.<br>世界各地有超过三、四百万我们的追随者和听众，这是有特殊意义的数字。</p>
<p>60:06<br>Those who haven’t heard and those who have heard:<br>Now walk into the churches. You wrote how you want to feed the people of hungry of Syria in your Greece. There are thousands more in Germany and the border’s locked out. When you can go to the German Keshe foundation supporters, the Iranian Keshe Foundnation supporters there is a huge number of you, I want to know what you are doing.<br>那些听到的没听到的：<br>现在，走进教堂，你写下你怎样让那些叙利亚的、希腊的饥民吃饱，进入德国的和封锁在边境外的还有好几千人，如果你是德国凯史基金会支持者，伊朗凯史基金会支持者，你们人数众多，我想知道你们在做什么？</p>
<p>60:36<br> Go to these environments and just leave a box. Don’t let nobody know, just park box, leave a box and walk away and tell people: “What you need, wish. The box will give you”.<br>You will find out the Germans will open the door, to the Syrians as they are one. Because now they are all eating from the same. You change the whole ethos.<br>去这些环境，只留下一个盒子。不要让人知道，只要放置盒子，然后走开，告诉人们：“你需要的，只要你许下愿望，盒子会给你”。<br>你会发现德国人将门敞开，对待叙利亚人如同他们是一体，因为，现在，他们都从同样的来源得到吃。你们改变大众的社会思潮。</p>
<p>You wanted the World Peace? This is the tool of World Peace.<br>You wanted to understand it? We have given you the reasons to understand it.<br>You wanted to be, to find the salvation? We have given you the tools of salvation.<br>你们要世界和平？这就是世界和平的工具。<br>你们想理解它？我们已经给你理由理解它。<br>你要找救济物？我们已经给你得到救济物的工具。</p>
<p>I have no problem, we stay online we go through the process, one by one of you, you have made the Magrav systems. Understand how it’s set up, how it is structured, and then you find out your Magrav systems becomes your flying machine into space.<br>我没问题，我们在线等待，我们通过这个进程，你们一个接一个，已经制作出磁引力系统，理解怎样设置，怎样构建，然后你发现你的磁引力系统成为你进入太空的飞行器。</p>
<p>So in so many ways, we are ready to become the man of the space from today.<br>But if you remember, when you went to become astronaut, we had to go to up to 4-5 years to get ready to know how to wear a spacesuit. How to be trained to go to space, how to handle weightlessness.<br>所以，以多种方式，从今天起我们准备好成为太空人。<br>但是，如果你记得，当你想成为宇航员，你必须要花4－5年时间来练习怎样穿宇航服，训练你怎样进入太空，怎样在失重条件下操作。</p>
<p>From now on you have to go to the school of your own understanding to become man of the space. This is 3-6 months change, those of you who come very close on collaborate and operate with this system, very close within next 3-6 months, you will lose all your digestion systems.<br>Because you take energy as you need.<br>从现在起，你必须亲自上学，你自己去理解怎样变成太空人。这是3－6个月的转变，你们非常密切合作和操作这个系统，很快在接下来3－6个月，你们将放弃你们的消化系统。<br>因为，你们得到你需要的能量。</p>
<p>Their body slowly starts going through its own evolution Because what you don’t need the body finds a way to dispose of.<br>When there is no food coming, there is no need for a stomach.<br>When the body realizes that there is enough whenever it needs, the storage tank of the liver is not needed, dying from liver cancer cannot be.<br>When there is no digestion system, dying of the stomach cancer can not be.<br>When you don’t have any system to cross the energy of the lung, to feed or to carry energy to the other places: There is no need for lymph, so a lymph cancer cannot exist.<br>Rectum cancer cannot be because you have nothing to dispose of.<br>身体慢慢地通过自己的进化，你不必要寻找弃置身体的方式。<br>当没有食物来到，胃就不需要了。<br>当身体意识到任何时候它的需要都满足，肝脏存储容器就不需要了，不再有人死于肝癌。<br>当没有消化系统，不再有人死于胃癌。<br>当没有任何系统需要通过肺来供给和传送能量，淋巴也不需要了，淋巴癌也不存在了。<br>直肠癌也没有了，因为你没有东西需要处理掉。</p>
<p>The question comes:<br>What happens to our womb and our testicles, that’s the surprise for you to keep.<br>How would we regenerate in the space, you will understand before we go to the space. Would we re-generate the same as we do at the present? Very far from it but very near to it.<br>问题来了：<br>我们的子宫，我们的睾丸会发生什么？那可是为你保持惊喜的。<br>在太空中我们怎样再生，在进入太空之前，你将理解，我们需要再生出象我们现在这样的吗？这些问题，看似遥远却很迫近了。</p>
<p>What are we going to do with our sound box? We read each other’s emotion, this is what I told you from the beginning.  In the space, before you do anything physical, your emotions will be heard. And I showed you the pattern of it , last week in the teachings after the public teaching.<br>我们拿声音盒子要做什么？我们互相阅读情感，这是我一开始就告诉你们的，在太空中，你过去所做的任何物理上的事情，你的情感都将被听出。我向你们展示了这个盒子样机，在上一周，在公开教学之后的教学上。</p>
<p>The question is: “Is the man ready for it?”.<br>I will put it to you. I have no choice. You have forced us to this position.<br>You are killing each other and planning to kill more, so we let you forget. We put you in the narcosis, we put you in a coma of not knowing what the war is.<br>问题是：“人类准备好了吗？”<br>我把问题推给你，我没有选择，你们已经强迫我们来到这个点上。<br>你们正在彼此杀戮，而且计划更多杀戮，所以，我们让你们忘记，使你们麻醉，让你们昏迷，不知道战争是什么。</p>
<p>第三部分<br>65:05<br>Take one of these units to every capital and leave it with your presence as a gift. Take it to every city and leave it. Take it to the army and leave it in the army. Take it in the companies which manufacture arm without them knowing it. Leave a box somewhere near.<br>Because you know what happens?<br>When the man is hungry and the box is near … “I wish I could have a hamburger.”<br>Zoom! … “Woo, I don’t feel hungry anymore. I receive my … [(blank) food?]. Very strange I can feel and taste the burger!”<br>But chew it as well because you are going to lose your teeth very soon. This is the last bit to crush the energy of an animal for the pleasures of you to survive.</p>
<p>We will evolve, this is the ultimate evolution.<br>But you have made the systems, there is enough of margrav systems and people who made it, that the process has already started. I can not stop, I have already brought you to the slaughter house of peace. Now you see when I tell you energy is irrelevant, because I have given you the energy of the universe.<br>拿其中一个单元到每个医院去，然后留下它作为礼物。将它带到每个城市放在那里。把它带到军队去并送给他们。把盒子带到不知道这个装置的军火制造商那里。或者将盒子带到附近。<br>因为你知道会发生什么？<br>当人们饥饿时而盒子在附近…“我希望我有个汉堡。”<br>变焦！(译者注：看啊)…“哇，我不再感到饿了。我收到我的…[(空白)食物？]。非常奇怪，我能感觉并且尝到汉堡的味道！“<br>但是还是咀嚼一下比较好，因为不咀嚼的话你将很快失去你的牙齿。这是最后一点消除你为了生存而对动物能量有需求的地方。<br>我们将进化，这是终极进化。<br>但是你已经制作了这个系统，有足够的磁引力场系统和制作他们的人，这个进程已经开始了。我不能阻止，我已经把你带到了和平的屠宰场。当我告诉你能量是无关紧要的，现在你明白了，因为我已经给了你宇宙的能量。</p>
<p>In time, when you do this, when you arrive at a point in a very short time, in the next 18 months to 2 years. You will lose your sight because your emotion becomes so strong that there is no need to see, or the size of the eyes will change drastically.<br>What you don’t need, you can see me without touching me, without me being anywhere near you, you can feel my emotion, you can feel what I feel and that’s what it matters to you. DO you need to see?<br>当你适时做这个(译者注：这里指使用磁引力场能量系统)，当你在2年或18个月后能够快速到达某地时，你将会失去你的视觉，因为你的情感变得如此强大以至于没有必要使用眼睛看了，或者是说你眼睛的尺寸已经彻底改变了。<br>你不再需要的是，你不碰到我就能看见我，也不需要我在你身边任何地方，你能感受到我的情感，你能感受到我所感受的，那才是对你来说很重要的。你还需要看见吗？</p>
<p>So, in so many ways, if you don’t understand it, I will tell you one thing:<br>The history of man from today has changed. Because there are those who are doing it. In next few months or weeks or whatever, try to produce as much as possible the New Margrav Combination System we have taught. [(<strong><em>seekers, please find out which one it is referring to here and revise accordingly</em></strong>)].<br>You will still go to the shopping centres, you will still enjoy going shopping, but I tell you one thing, one of the first things you will see will shut down is a food super-market.<br>The next thing you will see will shut down, is toilet roll factories.<br>And the biggest danger to humanity what are called “pampers” will go to the bin, because there is no child to be the need for it to damage the environment.<br>所以，在很多方面，如果你还不理解的话，我将告诉你一件事情：<br>人类从今天起历史将改变。因为有那些人正在做着改变历史的事情。在以后的几个月或者几周或者其他时间，试着生产我们已经教学过的尽可能多的新等离子体组合系统。[知识寻求者，请找出它是指的这里哪一个系统，并修订一下内容]<br>你还是会去购物中心，你还是会享受去购物，但是我告诉你一件事，你将看到的第一件事里面就有一个是食品超市将会关掉。<br>下一件事你将会看到关掉的是生产卫生纸的工厂。<br>对人类最大的危险即所谓的”暴饮暴食”将会被丢到垃圾桶里，因为不会有孩子因为食物需要而破坏环境了。</p>
<p>From today, we start the process of peace. And I tell you one thing, if you want to know how the way is done. We have two men who have pioneered it. We have 3 groups that if one get shut down or get anything (damaged). There are others, and all of you have learned about it.<br>Would you like to speak, the man who has made the first system and is trying it?<br>Jacky: Yes.<br>从今天起，我们开始和平的进程。我告诉你们一件事，如果你们想知道这是怎样进行的话。我们有2个人已经先进行了。我们有3个组其中如果有1个组被关闭或者被破坏的话，还有其他组继续的，你们所有人也已经学习它了。<br>你们想要和已经做出第一个系统并在试用它的人对话吗？<br>Jacky：是的</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Please explain who you are, where you are from and how you are trying it and tell us what are the feelings and the emotion you received up to now.<br>Jacky: Yeah, thank you. I am Jacky from Switzerland and I built my system and you gave us some directions from one week ago and I experimented for myself to feed from my system.<br>I can feel different vegetables and fruits. I can feel the orange, I can have the texture, i can take the energy of the orange. I can feed myself with this energy. I can go in my system. It’s like if I go in the restaurant, I take the card and I choose what I want to eat.<br>凯史先生:请说明你是谁，你来自哪里，你是怎么尝试它的，请告诉我们感觉是什么以及到目前为止你接收到的情感是什么。<br>Jacky：yeah，谢谢。我是Jacky，来自于瑞士，我制作了我的系统，您一周前给了我们一些指导，我自己体验了从我的系统获取供给。<br>我能感受到不同的蔬菜和水果。我能感受到桔子，我能感受到桔子的质地，我能获取桔子的能量。我能用这个能量供给我自己。我能进入我的系统。它就象我进了餐馆，我拿出卡并且我选择我想要吃的东西。</p>
<p>I make my menu and it costs me nothing.<br>And this is for the food. And after 5 days I eat really, really less of food, quite nothing. And I feel a lot of energy.<br>01:10:00<br>My feelings totally changing.<br>I can read the emotion, I can speak with somebody who are not more on this planet.<br>I can have some beautiful experiences with a big friend of as who is not on this planet and we can speak with her.<br>我点了我的菜单，且没有任何花费。<br>这是作为食物。在5天后我真的吃了东西，吃的比以前少多了，完全没有(译者注：没懂)，我感到了很多的能量。<br>我的感觉完全变了。<br>我能读到情感，我能和某人说话，但是这个人不在地球上。<br>我有一些很美妙的体验是和一个不在地球上的大朋友的，我们能和她交谈。</p>
<p>Then I … you want to see if other, with other persons, if it is possible.<br>So I invited five of my best friends, my best confidant friends, and they have all of the same experience. They can eat, they can drink, they can have what they want.<br>And someone doesn’t eat for three days and one eats some food, but it’s not the same relationship with food.<br>They eat really less, they can’t go more in the toilets, some toilets but a little, little bit.<br>然后我…你想要看是否还和其他人，如果可能的话还和其他人说话。<br>所以我邀请了5个我最要好的朋友，5个密友，他们也都有相同的体验。他们能够感受到吃，感受到喝水，他们能够拥有他们想要的。<br>有人不吃东西3天了，有个人吃一些食物，但是这不是和食物相同的关系???。<br>他们真实的吃方面已经减少了，他们不再去更多次卫生间了，还去几次但是很少。</p>
<p>Ummm, then I want to experiment something. I have one of my best friends who live in France, and I connect my system with the video. I just put the camera on the system and my friend come from the video and choose what he wants to eat and now from two or three days, I don’t remember, eat some piece of bread and nothing else quite nothing else.<br>I can drink the same way. I can make it with emotion. I can put emotion in the system and the other person can feel the emotion.<br>We make a test. We have the visit from the Creator, and we can speak with him.<br>And, … um, … yeah it’s mind blowing experiences.<br>嗯，然后我想体验一些事情。我有个好友是住在法国的，我用这个视频连接我的系统。我刚把摄像头放在系统上，我的朋友出现在视频中，他选择他想要吃的东西，现在已经2-3天了，我不记得具体天数了，他只吃几片面包，其他东西完全都不吃了。<br>我可以用同样方式喝水。我可以用情感来做这个事情。我能把情感放到系统里，其他人可以感受到这个情感。<br>我们做了一个测试，我们有来自造物主的访问，我们能够和他说话。<br>并且，嗯，它有一种令人极度兴奋的体验。</p>
<p>And for me you know it’s little bit difficult to speak because it’s so much emotions, you know you, … It’s when you, … I give all my life to see this moment you know. And we are at that point. It’s, a, really beautiful. Yea. It’s difficult to speak, sorry.<br>Mr. Keshe: Thank you Jacky. Can you, we try to make that people understand, we go through this steps by steps. In one session, there was five or six of you sitting, where we asked each one of you to have what you please, what you like, you didn’t have to have to eat all the same thing. Can you explain that session to us?<br>对我来说说话有点困难，因为有太多的情感，你知道的。就是当你…我给了我所有的生命来看到这个时刻。我们就在那个点。这真的很美。Yeah.这是很难说清楚的，对不起。<br>凯史先生：感谢Jacky。你能再说明一下吗？我们试图让人们理解，我们一步一步来看一下。在一次会议中，有5到6个人在你周围，我们询问你们每个人都有自己喜欢或者爱好的东西(译者注：食物)，你不必吃所有同样的东西。你能向我们说明那个会议吗？</p>
<p>Jack: Yes, we start with some food that they like and a every people choose one thing they like. Someone is pizza, another person is tortilla, and another, melon yes, another was spaghetti, and the five I don’t remember.<br>And they can feel and taste the food and can feel the energy. Someone more, someone less, but everyone had the feeling of the food. And they feel thirsty and one person eat chocolate. It was disgusting because it’s too much chocolate in his mouth, you know? She feel really like she’s full of chocolate in her body and the sensation stay for one days long.<br>Jack:是的，我们从一些他们喜欢的食物开始(译者注：不是真的食物)，每个人都选一样他们喜欢的食物。有人选披萨，另一个人选玉米饼，还有人选瓜，也有人选意大利面，第五个人我不记得了。<br>他们能感受并品尝食物，也能感到能量。有人多一点，有人少一点，但是每个人都有食物的感觉。他们感到口渴，一个人选择吃巧克力。这是令人厌恶的因为在他嘴里有太多巧克力了，你知道吗？她感到真的就像她身体里充满了巧克力一样，这种感觉保持了一天那么长时间。</p>
<p>Then we do the same with water and four persons have no problem to drink water, one person it’s a little bit more difficulties, but the five had the feeling of the water.<br>And then you ask to take some alcohol to test if you can have the sensation and for me it’s incredible you know because I was not in the session, I’m in my computer and I see the scene.<br>然后我们也用水做了同样的事，四个人喝水没有问题，一个人有一点困难，但是5个人都有喝水的感觉。<br>然后你提出如果你能有感觉可以用酒精来测试，对于我来说这是不可思议的，因为我不在会议上，我在我的电脑前看这一幕场景。</p>
<p>01:15:00<br>And when you ask to drink something and take a certain glass of what they want to drink, I see that the person is totally drunk, instantaneously, you know?<br>The eyes, the face, all is totally changing in one second, no, no one second, instantaneously!<br>She’s warm and she’s, … she needs to stand up, she’s like [???detubing???] And she feel really the sensation of the alcohol. And then she go back in her house and she sleep and the other day, she’s totally like she had drank a lot the day before, you know?<br>And she can’t eat anything and she have really true feeling of being totally drunk.<br>Another person you make with the [???] to smell good smells.<br>They can have the smell after you do with the bad smell, and one person for three hours had the smell and she can’t change the smell, a really bad smell. And yea.<br>01:15:00<br>当你提出喝点东西且设想喝了一杯他们想要喝的东西时，我看到那个人立刻就完全醉了，你知道吗？<br>眼睛，脸，所有东西一秒内就变了，不，不到一秒，是立即就变了！<br>她感到很热且她…她需要站起来，她就像[???detubing]，她感到真的有酒精的感觉。然后她回到她的房间就睡着了，第二天，她就像前天喝过很多酒一样，你知道吗？<br>她不能吃其他东西，她已经真的感到完全醉了。<br>另一个人闻到了你制造出的很香的味道。<br>当你放出坏味道时他们能感觉到这种味道，一个人有3小时都能闻到，她不能改变这种味道，是真的有坏味道，而且是肯定有的。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: That was the smell of ammoniac.<br>Jacky: Yea. Yea. Exactly.<br>And we make some…after, we make some test with the emotion.<br>So, one person choose an emotion, the group put in the system, and the 4 persons can feel the emotion this person put in the system.<br>It was the peace and the 4 persons and the same concept she, she put on the system.<br>After, um, my ??? i don’t know if i can say that … with the person, she come and speak. One person is not in the room and, a, you said you can speak with this person and the five …<br>凯史先生：那是氨的味道。<br>Jacky:肯定是，确实是的。<br>我们产生了一些…之后我们对情感做了一些测试。<br>所以，由一个人选择一个情感，由小组把它放到系统中，而另外4个人可以感到这个人放到系统中的情感。<br>这个情感是和平，其他4个人也都有和她放到系统中的同样的观念。<br>然后，嗯，我的??? 我不知道我是否可以和这个人谈到…，她来了并且说话了。一个不在房间里，你说你能和这个人交谈，且和5个人…(译者注：交谈)。</p>
<p>Keshe: We have no problem. You can be open about it. We promised: We fulfill the promise.<br>Jacky: OK, you ask if the person in the center of the system, if she want to see the Christ and she said “Yes” and you asked three questions and one question nobody can know what is the answer and one answer is totally 100% sure … it’s the answer showed: She only can have the communication with Christ. So, because she can’t know the answer.<br>And everybody in the room can see the presence of this person, of this Christ.<br>And, what I can say with all these things is that you know it’s a, it’s so much emotion, so much energy you …<br>Two, three people are totally mind blowing and it’s a lot lot lot lot of emotion. It’s like when you said it’s mega millivolts in a matter-state, but in a plasma state, it’s mega mega mega mega watt, you know.</p>
<p>凯史先生：我们没有问题。你可以谈论这个话题。我们承诺：我们履行诺言。<br>Jacky:好的，你问如果人在系统中心，如果她想要看Christ，且她说“是的”，你问3个问题，一个问题没有人知道，一个答案完全正确的…这是显示的答案：她只能和Christ通讯。因为她不能知道答案。<br>房间里每个人都能看到这个人的存在，这个Christ的存在。<br>对于所有这些事情我能说的就是，你知道的它是这么多的情感，这么多的能量你(译者注：能感觉到的能量)<br>2到3个人完全极度兴奋了，这是很大量的情感。这就像当你说物质状态的大量伏特时，它其实是在等离子体状态，它是非常大量的瓦特一样。你知道的</p>
<p>This is incredible person. They are really really nice and really peaceful, but if you are in these states, it’s mega watt of energy you take from this and you need to be ready and you need to really have good thoughts, think-ness.<br>And you need to be peaceful because it is instantaneously that you take what you want and, you know, all that you give you take back instantaneously, so you need to be prepared for that.<br>And now, my room is a, the walls are really like they are grooming and when I go in a shop I can read the emotion of the person. I can read the emotion and all the thing with fruit, with the vegetables.<br>这是令人难以置信的人。他们真的真的很好很和平，但是如果你在这些状态，它是大量你能得到的瓦特能量，你需要准备好，你需要先有好的想法。<br>你需要有和平的状态，因为你想到什么就会立刻发生，你知道，所有你给予的会立即反馈给你，所以你需要做好准备。<br>现在，我的房间是一个墙，这个墙真的就像他们来过，当我去商店里买东西，我能读到别人的情感。我能读到情感和所有水果以及蔬菜的感觉。<br>And I really understand what you said regarding emotions and you don’t need the mouth and ears, because you don’t need that you know you can feel this and with your eyes it is the same.<br>It’s like you can communicate and see things very, very long distance. Space become totally different when you see.<br>The only thing that is difficult for the moment is to shut up the matter eyes, you know? And really feel the things and emotions. It’s why I said we are at 20-30% of the process, but it’s a beautiful life coming.<br>Yea, we can totally change the humanity, you know.<br>It’s …  I can’t have words for the present you give to humanity.<br>01:20:00<br>And I really understand what you said regarding emotions and you don’t need the mouth and ears, because you don’t need that you know you can feel this and with your eyes it is the same.<br>It’s like you can communicate and see things very, very long distance. Space become totally different when you see.<br>The only thing that is difficult for the moment is to shut up the matter eyes, you know? And really feel the things and emotions. It’s why I said we are at 20-30% of the process, but it’s a beautiful life coming.<br>我真地能够理解你所说的有关情绪的话，你不需要嘴巴，耳朵，因为你不需要那些了，你知道你感受到的和用眼睛去看到的是一样的。<br>这如同你能够和距离非常，非常遥远的事物建立沟通，看见他们。当你能看见的时候，太空将变得完全不同了。<br>对于这个时刻唯一的障碍是关闭物质的眼睛，知道吗？然后真正地去感受这些食物和情感。这就是我为什么说我们现在还处在这个过程的20-30%的阶段，但是美好的生活即将来临。<br>Yea, we can totally change the humanity, you know.<br>It’s …  I can’t have words for the present you give to humanity.<br>是的，你知道，我们可以彻底改变全人类，。<br>这是…,我无法用语言去表达的你给予人类的礼物。<br>And now I think it’s in our hand. It’s a big responsibility you give to us, but you know when you ask as yesterday, if we want to continue the process and if we, we want to continue or we want to shut up the system. All the team, the persons involved in this situation, all they are ready to give their life to save humanity, you know? And, yea. It’s beautiful. It’s some great people and they achieve a beautiful realization.<br>It’s a tough decision. It’s not easy to take, you know, but we have no choice. We can’t continue on this way on this planet. We really need to change the course, you know. We can’t kill animals and kill other forms of life. It’s not possible to continue like that. If we continue like that, there will not be another planet.<br>Yea, we need to totally change our mentality, you know, and when you put some foot/feet in this universe, in the plasma universe, and you see things in a different viewpoint, it’s a, it’s really beautiful, because beautiful enough, because you can feel the pain and sadness of the animals we kill and all this war and all this bad emotion and when you can start to feel all this, you really understand that you need to make something about that. Yea.<br>现在，我认为它就在我们手中。你给我们的是巨大的责任，但是就像昨天你问到，我们是否愿意继续这个进程，我们是想继续还是关闭这个系统。整个团队，那些已经参与其中的人，那些所有准备好用自己的生命去拯救人类的人，你知道吗？是的，这是美丽的事业。这是一些了不起的人，他们实现了美好的预期。<br>这是一个艰难的决定。肩负它不容易，如你所知，但是我们别无选择。我们不可以在这个星球上继续这样的生存方式了。我们真的需要去改变航向。我们不可以去宰杀动物和扼杀其它的生命体。继续这样下去是没有出路的。如果我们执迷不悔，没有另一个星球在等着我们。<br>是的，我们需要完全扭转我们的精神，你懂的，当你们立足于这个宇宙，这个等离子态的宇宙，你看待事物就会有不同的视角，这是，嗯，这是非常美好的，因为足够美丽，因为你们能够体会到被我们屠宰的动物们的痛苦和悲伤以及关于这场战争和恶劣情感的所有一切。而当我们能够感受到这所有一切的时候，你就真的能够理解你需要为此做些什么了，是的。<br>And I want to thank you a lot my friends were willing to continue this process. It’s not easy for us, because me, I live on this and we were meant for four or five months, but for us it is all new and in one night it decided to continue and it’s just beautiful.<br>And I thanks a lot and I thanks you, but now my feeling it’s, it’s now we have all the tools and we need to take responsibility and everyone on this planet who know this technology needs to take responsibility and give to his neighbor some Magrav units, some pens, some pain pads, and some patches and we need to go to the government, to the church, and all the places we can put these units because we have a lot of lamp[???]<br>我要感谢很多朋友，你们自发去继续这项事业。这对“我们”而言不容易，由于我，我以此为生命，我们也注定拥有过去的四或者五个月时间，但是对于“我们”这是全新的，并且在一夜之内我们决定继续下去，就是这么美好。<br>我非常感激，我谢谢你们。但是此刻我的感觉是，我们有了所有的工具，我们需要去承担起责任，在这个星球上知道这个技术的每个人都应当承当责任，把Magrav的一些装置，一些笔，一些止痛贴，和一些补丁传递给他的邻居。我们需要走向政府部门，走进教堂，所有我们能够安置这些单元的场所，因为我们有大量的…？？？<br>This is the magic box, you know.<br>All your wishes can become true and now we need to decide what is our wish for this planet and connect together and decide it what we want to make.<br>It’s our decision. You make the present and we need now to make the decision.<br>Collectively, and together what we want to do.</p>
<p>And we can’t go back. Now we are on the process and we need to continue to follow this…yeah.</p>
<p>你知道，这是一个神奇的盒子。<br>你所有的愿望都能成真，现在我们需要决定对于这个星球我们的愿望是什么，联结在一起，决定我们要实现什么。<br>这是我们共同的决定，你们创造了今天，而现在我们需要做出决定。<br>齐心协力，我们一起想要做什么。<br>我们没有回头路。我们正在路上，我们需要继续追随下去…Yeah.</p>
<p>第四部分<br>01:25:00<br>Mr. Keshe:Can you tell us about your friend with the computer, how you interact?<br>凯史：说说你的朋友，你们怎样用计算机进行互动？</p>
<p>Jacky:Yeah, absolutely.So this is, when we make this, I see it’s possible when the people are in front of the system.<br>杰克：好，那当然。是这样的，我们在做这个时，我清楚了这是可行的，当人在系统面前。</p>
<p>And after [that] I tried to see if it’s possible with persons who are not in front, in the [???piece???].<br>之后，我试着看看如果人不在系统面前有没有可能性。[???]</p>
<p>So I asked a friend in France, a beautiful man in France if it’s ok to make a test with me.<br>所以，我请一位法国朋友，法国美男子，请他和我一起做一个测试。</p>
<p>So I take my computer, I put the camera on the system and then I asked him to … if he can see or create an orange, lemon, if he can have the taste, the texture, the sensation and if he can take the energy of this.<br>然后，我用我的计算机，给系统安装上摄像机，然后要求他进行……看他能否见到或创造出桔子、柠檬，是否有味道、纹理、感觉，看他是否能得到这种能量。</p>
<p>And he said yes to all of the questions. Some more, some less.<br>之后，所有这些项目他都说Yes，或多或少。</p>
<p>And after [that] I asked him if he is willing to make some test during the next day.<br>然后，我又问他是否乐意接下来进行一整天的测试。</p>
<p>And I asked him … I sent him a photo [of the system] and I said to him: “When you are hungry, you can come and feed with my system.”<br>我要求他……我把系统的照片发给他，对他说：“当你饥饿的时候，你可以来让我的系统喂养你。”</p>
<p>And he makes this during two days and during two days he had some [solid] food but really little.<br>这个测试进行了整整两天，在这两天中，他得到一些固态食物，但是很少一点。</p>
<p>And he can come in my system and [it could] feed him.<br>And it totally works for him!<br>他能进入我的系统，然后[系统可以]喂养他。<br>这个系统全心全意为他工作！</p>
<p>It’s beautiful and … But I realized at this moment … it’s beautiful when you change your life.<br>真的很美妙，……此刻，我意识到……当你改变你的生命，真的很美妙！</p>
<p>When you don’t take every time from other people, from other beings, from other forms of life.<br>当你不需要每次从别人，从别的存有，从别的生命形态那里索取。</p>
<p>But when you start to see the card in another phase, you know, not taking but giving.<br>你开始明白去下一个阶段签到，你知道，“不拿取，只给予”。</p>
<p>And now I allow in the night or in the day everyone or every entity who wants to come and feed with the energy.<br>现在，白天或者晚上，我允许每个人或者每个存有，他想要他就来接受这个系统的能量供养。</p>
<p>It’s free for everyone!<br>And it’s beautiful, the feeling to give the energy, when you know, you have no … it’s totally infinite in energy. It’s not “Free Energy”, it’s “Infinite Energy” and can give as much as you want.<br>对每个都自由开放。<br>非常美好，给予能量的感觉，当你知道，你不必……整个无限能量，这不是“自由能源”，这是“无限能源”，你想要多少就给你多少。</p>
<p>The more you give, the more you receive!<br>And it’s a totally mind-blowing feeling.<br>You become the Creator!<br>Yeah.<br>你给予越多，你收到越多！<br>这是让人整个兴奋的感觉。<br>你变成造物者。<br>太好了.</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:We have two choices:On the day we tested this thing, we asked the other members of the Keshefoundation who are on Zoom, we were watching the process, to try to have a taste with a hot tea or a coffee.<br>凯史：我们有两个选项：那天我们测试系统，我们要求在Zoom 上的凯史基金会会员，我们观察这个进程，试着得到热茶或热咖啡的味道。</p>
<p>And we only had one person who had the feeling of the heat, of the burning of the tongue, if I am correct.<br>只有一个人得到热的感觉，舌头上发烫的感觉，如果我没错的话。</p>
<p>Jacky: Yes, correct.<br>杰克：是的，没错。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:Would you like to speak? The man who felt the feeling?<br>…<br>凯史：你讲一下吧？你的感觉？<br>……</p>
<p>Are you there or are you asleep?<br>[maybe Vince talked shortly, not hearable in the video]<br>I think so, would you like to say how you felt?<br>你在线吗还是在睡觉？<br>[可能文斯在说话，没听到视频]<br>我也觉得，请你说说你是怎样的感觉？</p>
<p>Vince:Well you, … you asked to … you were talking about the coffee feeling in or on my tongue or on my tongues? And at that moment I had the numb sensation of the hot coffee on my tongue and I knew it quite readily because I had burned my tongue two days prior from a hot coffee.<br>文斯：您……要我……您在说我舌头上的咖啡的感觉？那时，我舌头上有那种热咖啡的发麻的感觉，非常真实的感觉，因为两天前我舌头刚被热咖啡烫伤。</p>
<p>So when … I was actually driving at the time when we were talking about that. And of course at that moment I felt like I was just back two days prior and my tongue was numb and it felt like it had been burnt by hot coffee.<br>当时……实际上我在驾车，我们在谈论[测试]这件事，就在这时，我感觉象是又回到两天前，我舌头发麻，感到被热咖啡烫伤。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:But were you drinking coffee?<br>凯史：但是你在喝咖啡吗？</p>
<p>Vince: No! I was going to get a coffee. [Vince laughs loud and heartly]<br>文斯：没有！我正想着来一杯咖啡。[文斯爽朗大笑]</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:But you’re in Canada and the system is in Switzerland?<br>凯史：但是你人在加拿大，这个系统在瑞士？</p>
<p>Vince: That’s right!<br>文斯：正确。</p>
<p>01:30:00<br>Mr. Keshe:Ok.<br>凯史：OK.</p>
<p>There are a couple of points which I have to say. You have to understand the next step.<br>有一两个要点我必须要说，你必须理解下一步。</p>
<p>If you went through the process of receiving energy as food, … when you went through the process of receiving water, … it should have become obvious to you that you can receive energy to end up with your pains!<br>如果你通过接收能量的进程，比如接收食物，……，如果你通过接收水的进程，……那么显然，你也能通过接收能量让疼痛终止。</p>
<p>You receive energy that if you have for example pain in your back or pain in your arm that the energy which is received is the balance to where the pain is in your body.<br>你接收那些能量，比如你后背疼痛，或你胳臂疼痛，那你接收到的这些能量就来平衡你身体病灶点的疼痛。</p>
<p>So, you can try to see, … you can use the system not as a medicine but as the balance for your body in interaction with his environment.<br>So you can eradicate a lot of diseases.<br>所以，你试试看，……你能利用系统而不是医药，利用身体与环境的交互作用一样能够平衡你的身体。<br>所以，你能根除多数疾病。</p>
<p>Just because we lose our digestion system and our lung does not mean [that] the other pieces and organs do not fall apart or will not suffer.<br>因为只要我们丧失消化系统，肺不想承担别的部件[的能量供应]，器官会崩溃，将遭受痛苦。</p>
<p>But through this method, through this technology you can achieve balance through your emotion to the point where the problem ist.<br>但是，通过这个方法，通过这个技术，你能通过你的情感来获得对问题点的平衡。</p>
<p>This is the new way, new dimension in the space.<br>这是新途径，空间里的新维度。</p>
<p>Sandor:Mr. Keshe, it’s Sandor here. We had recently a case in Hungary when somebody installed the secondary Magrav Unit and what’s interesting it was producing heat<br>sensation [??? hina maria ???] but the units were made pecifically and not as usual.<br>May I present some pictures about?<br>桑德尔：凯史先生，我是桑德尔。我最近有一个匈牙利的情况，有个人安装了第二套磁引力单元，非常有趣，这个系统产生热量，感觉……这个单元被制造得非常特别，不同寻常。<br>我可以呈现几张图片吗？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Yes, go ahead.<br>凯史：好，继续。</p>
<p>Sandor:I hope, these pictures come, … so one interesting thing is the GANS collected on one corner …<br>桑德尔：我希望，这些图片，……其中一件有趣的事情是甘斯聚集到一个角落……</p>
<p>But another interesting thing is that … The gentleman is Mr. Zoltan Sabor.<br>He made several Magrav’s, he made 4 Magravs by himself.<br>另一件有趣的事情……这位绅士叫卓尔坦-萨布尔。<br>他制作了几个磁引力单元，他自己制作了4个磁引力单元。</p>
<p>And this is a unit which he made it at the beginning according to the misunderstanding that the coils were twisted in a reverse direction.<br>这是他制作的一个单元，一开始，他根据错误的理解，线圈是按反方向绕制的。</p>
<p>By that time when he finished this he already had to other Magrav’s in his house.<br>那时，他做成了这台，他屋里已经有另一台磁引力单元。</p>
<p>And here is a corner where he has this Magrav. It’s a green one and with some GANSes around.<br>这角上就是这台，绿色的，它外面涂了一些甘斯。</p>
<p>Here he has the place where he is producing the GANSes<br>这里是他生产甘斯的地方。</p>
<p>And when he connected together in the same room diagonally in opposite corners, the “old” Magrav and the “new” Magrav, which was actually … which he made it previously with the coils in reverse order … so here you can see the other which was already in function …<br>他将它们连接在一起，在同一个房间的对角，一台是“旧”磁引力单元，一台是“新”磁引力单元，就是之前按反向绕制弹簧的那台……这里你能看见[早先的]另一台，它已经在工作……</p>
<p>… suddenly the GANS production stopped.<br>……突然之间，甘斯生产停止了。</p>
<p>And his wife was walking in between the two Magravs always confined that there is some strong heat which she feels.<br>他妻子在两台磁引力单元之间走动，这里总是很狭窄，她感觉到有些强热。</p>
<p>So I made this drawing according to his description:<br>我根据他的描述画了一幅画：</p>
<p>So “MAGRAV 2” was a Magrav which was already in function.<br>“磁引力单元2”已经在运行。</p>
<p>And “MAGRAV 1” on the other corner, it’s the newly put in function Magrav which had the coils made in reverse order.<br>“磁引力单元1”在另一个角落，这是新加入运行的那台，他的线圈是按反向规则绕制的。</p>
<p>The position where this gentleman used to sit, close to the upper right corner of the room, in the front of a desk with his computer and the GANSes beside the window.<br>这位先生通常坐这里，靠近房间的右上角，桌子前面是电脑，甘斯生产在窗户边。<br>And so I supposed that the reason of heating was that one of these Magravs was giving … that with normal coils [ MAGRAV 2 in the picture above] and that with the coils in reverse [ MAGRAV 1 in the picture above] were taking ?<br>我假设产生热的原因，发热是来自这些磁引力单元之中的一台发出来的……，是按正常方向线圈这台[图中“磁引力场2”]在给出，而反向线圈这台[图中“磁引力场1”]在接收吗？</p>
<p>I remember once you said that in one of the workshops that those who have built such a Magrav with coils in a wrong direction: “Do not throw them away” because later you will show us how to use that for heating.<br>我记得一次您在太空学院说过，你们制造磁引力系统，谁要是用错误的[绕线]方向来制作线圈，不要冒险投入运行，因为，稍后你将给我们展示怎样用它们致热。</p>
<p>And now what I suppose that it happened here according to my understanding:<br>根据我的理解，我假定这样发生的：</p>
<p>One Magrav was giving fields which otherwise would be spherical but the other Magrav which was taking the same field strength was pulling along the entire room the fields … and those interacted with the fields of the body and created some friction between the fields and that caused the heating?<br>一个磁引力单元给出场，是球形的场，但是，另一个磁引力单元收到同样强度的场，沿着整个房间场来拉动，这些场与人体场互动，场与场之间形成摩擦，导致热量产生。对吗？</p>
<p>This was my simple explanation for the case.<br>这是我对这个情况的简单解释。</p>
<p>01:35:12<br>Mr. Keshe:Yeah but that is what you can do for heating in respect to the other systems in the house.<br>凯史：好的，那就是说明你能对房子里面的另一个系统生产热量。</p>
<p>What we are talking about [now] is your interaction … we’re talking about development of the technology in a way for [being] ready for PEACE, not for heating.<br>我们谈什么呢，现在是你们的互动……<br>我们谈技术开发，这样的方式是为和平做准备，而不是为了生热。</p>
<p>This what you brought in is somehow irrelevant to here, but is good to understand.<br>你带来的某些方法与这里不相干，但是理解得很好。</p>
<p>Sandor: Maybe however part of  the Oasis-Project.<br>桑德尔：也许做为绿洲项目的一部分吧。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:So, what is important for us and what is part of …Can you stop sharing, please?<br>The process what we are talking about is how to make the system to be able for you to generate the heat within your own body!<br>凯史：所以，对我们什么最重要，一部分……能停下共享吗？这个过程，我们谈论的是怎样让这个系统能够使你在身体内部产生热能。</p>
<p>But what you need according to the environment which keeps your emotion intact, keeps your Emotion and Physicality in order.<br>但是，你需要根据环境，保持你的情感完整，保持你的情感和身体都良好有序。</p>
<p>One of the first things you will see is reduction in the food consumption. But because it’s done naturally, the body will start protecting itself.<br>首先第一件事情是你看到你的食品消耗减少，但是自然发生的，身体开始自我保护。</p>
<p>What does this mean is that:<br>Your digestion system will not dry up that you will have awesome complications.<br>这意味着什么呢？<br>你的消化系统将不会干涸，你将发生令人畏惧的并发症。</p>
<p>The digestion system will use the energy received to keep his operation and through the evolution, the body will shut down.<br>消化系统利用接收能量来保持它的运作，通过这个演化，身体将停歇。</p>
<p>In so many ways we will come in the next few weeks to show you small portable units which you can carry with yourself like in your pocket. That’s your food lunch, that’s your Energy-Pack.<br>以多种方式，下一两个星期，我们将向你们展示小型手提式单元，你可以放口袋里随身携带，那是你的午餐，是你的“能量包”。</p>
<p>And as I explained in the discussions of yesterday … last night with the innovation team is that as you absorb energy, the GANS of the body of the man with the GANS of the neuro-system which stays will create an absorption of the energy from the environment which through your neuro-system which is there through your emotion will start protecting man to become a camouflage.<br>就如我在昨天……昨晚和创新团队讨论时说过，你吸收能量，人类身体保留下来的神经系统的甘斯，建立一个对环境能量的吸收机制，通过你的神经系统，通过你的情感，将开启对人体的保护，[外围]形成一种伪装。</p>
<p>To stand the environments, you go in. We can submerge in a liquid, doesn’t matter what the liquid is. You still take the energy what the liquid provides because it’s atomic-molecular structure still has a friction which releases energy, You take what it [don’t] needs …<br>你进去站在那个环境里面，我们可以淹没在液体中，不要担心液体是什么，你一直摄取由液体提供的能量，因为，液体的原子-分子结构持续摩擦释放能量，你获得你需要的……</p>
<p>So: Death for man by suffocation in the space becomes a history!<br>所以：在太空中，人类因窒息而死亡变成历史了！</p>
<p>We can take off anywhere in the space and go for a walk to see how it looks.<br>在太空中，我们可以从任何位置出去散步观景。</p>
<p>Because your emotion will transfer your neuro-system for the body to transfer to accept the energy at the level which it needs.<br>因为，你的情感将转变你的神经系统，在身体需要的水平上接收能量。</p>
<p>If you go back on all the interactions of the man with men of universe: No one has ever seen any of them wearing clothes on the surface on this planet.<br>如果你回去，在人类与宇宙人所有的互动中，你永远看不到这个星球上的任何人的外表穿着衣服。</p>
<p>None of them walks with a mask.<br>Because the advanced cultures have achieved this process.<br>散步的人没有一个有掩饰。<br>因为先进文明已经达到了这个进程。</p>
<p>And not to waste time for thousands of years to send more teachers to teach that the man learns in one go, we have put the whole package together.<br>不要浪费数千年时间送很多教师去教育人类学习，一下子，我们已经将所有的打包在一起。</p>
<p>So, this goes back to my promise. We’ll bring man into the universal community, equal to the others that will not be abused.<br>所以，这就回到我的承诺：我们将带领人类进入宇宙社区，别的存在同样平等，将不再受虐待。</p>
<p>Now it’s in the hand of the man to abuse it or not abuse himself.<br>现在，虐待或不虐待，掌握在人类自己手里。</p>
<p>Only those who become detached from physicality … now you understand what detachment means … because now that you use the system, you have no inertial component in your body: You’re detached from physicality.<br>只需与物理身体分离……现在，你理解分离的意思……因为现在你利用这个系统，你身体没有惯性组件，你就从物理身体分离。</p>
<p>Physical life is the tangibility. Now with this process, you become independent.<br>物理身体是有实体的。现在，随着这个进程，你变得独立自主。</p>
<p>You become independent of tangible entities. So now you start living a universal life you will find out: You don’t need the clothes of [???fair???] of animal or the skin of another animal.<br>你从有形实体里独立出来。所以现在你开始以宇宙生命的方式生活，你将发现：你不需要动物的[毛来做]衣服或者别的动物的皮肤 [来做衣服]。</p>
<p>You change your skin according to the Emotion and the Environment [in] which you are.<br>你改变你的皮肤，根据你的情感和所处的环境。</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, in the coming months, we teach very rapidly the Space Technology. This is what I told you in past few weeks: We have entered the phase of the change in a rapid phase because we have to.<br>在接下来的几周，在接下来几个月，我们快速地传授空间技术。这是我过去一两周告诉过你们的：我们已经进入急速转变的阶段，因为我们不得不这样。</p>
<p>01:40:00<br>What I would like to do is to ask Jacky to explain his system. How it is, what it is and then, if you like, you can show your system.<br>我请杰克来解释他的系统，怎样做，做什么，然后怎样，如果你愿意，你可以展示你的系统。</p>
<p>You have to understand that Ali is producing the same. And a similar kind of system is getting developed in Philippines. And if you have MAGRAV systems built, I know the German manufacturing group with Richard [ the “Flying Dutchman” Ubique ] have these systems available to them:<br>你必须理解，阿里正在制造同样的系统，一个类似的系统正在菲律宾研发中。如果你有磁引力系统构造，我知道德国理查德制造小组[“飞行荷兰人”]有这些实用的系统——</p>
<p>Start putting it together and and start testing from now to Thursday.<br>从现在到星期四，把这些系统安装在一起开始进行测试。</p>
<p>We have to find out what you take, what you give, if you feel the same or you need to adjust your system to be able to reach the point.<br>我们还得弄清楚你得到什么，你给出什么，如果你感觉是一样的。或者你需要调整你的系统，使之能够达到那个点。</p>
<p>We know and we’ve seen different apparatuses with Ali. Ali forever is changing his system, he teaches us something and he goes to the next one.<br>我们知道，我们已经看到阿里有不同装置，阿里总是不断改造他的系统，他教我们一些，然后他又进行下一个。</p>
<p>With Jacky we have seen the stability of the system. He stays with it, he stays and keeps and now what I would like to do, Jacky: Educate us, how you built your system. How it’s set and if you have a camera, you can show it if you want to show it.<br>杰克让我们看到系统的稳定性，他和系统待在一起，持续待在那里，现在我要请杰克：教给我们，你怎样构建你的系统，怎样设置它，如果你有摄像机，你可以展示给我们，如果你愿意的话。</p>
<p>And then I take you to the next step.<br>然后，我来带你去下一步。</p>
<p>Jacky: Ok, no problem.<br>杰克：好的，没问题。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Thank you very much.<br> 凯史：非常感谢你！</p>
<p>Jacky: One second, I prepare my camera …<br>杰克：稍等一下，我准备一下摄像机……</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: No problem. Do you want me to speak while you getting yourself sorted?<br> 凯史：没问题。在你自己整理的时候要我接着讲吗？</p>
<p>Jacky: I think … yes … I think it’s good if you can speak …<br>杰克：我想……是的……您能讲最好……</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Ok. So what we are going to see with the Jacky’s system …<br>凯史：好。我们要从杰克的系统看到什么……</p>
<p>Jacky: I need to be authorized to put my camera on …<br>杰克：我需要授权加入摄像机……</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Rick, can you authorize him, please?<br>凯史：瑞克，请授权给他吧？</p>
<p>Rick:  Ah yes.<br>瑞克：好的。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: What you need to understand is the star formation in conjunction with other star formations. These are very, very practical ways of doing it. I leave it to you and I stand back.<br>凯史：你需要理解的是，星体结构与星体结构的组合，这种做法是非常非常实用。我交给你，我退后。</p>
<p>Jacky:<br>This is the 1st star formation I do. And then you asked me to make some change and to turn the coils 90 degrees (90°), the coils.<br>杰克：<br>这是我做的第一个星体结构。您要求我做一些改变，将弹簧线圈转90度。</p>
<p>So after [that] I make a new one. It was this star formation:<br>后来，我做了一个新的，就是这个：</p>
<p>And then you said to us to …<br>然后，您对我们说到……</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Ok, let’s … just one second.<br>The 1st set is a flat coil, the new set is a universal coil.<br>These are the flat coils:<br>凯史：OK，让我们……等一会。<br>第一个装置是平面线圈，新装置是一个通用的线圈。<br>这些是平面线圈。</p>
<p>And the other one is a universal core when one coil sits at 90 degrees (90°) with the other.<br>另一个是通用线圈，一个线圈与另一个线圈设置成90度。</p>
<p>Ok? That they can see difference what you mean by the coil.<br>OK？这就是他们能看见的你这个线圈的区别。</p>
<p>Carry on, please.<br>请继续。</p>
<p>Jacky:<br>And then you released the new blueprint of the last system with the one up three down. Three reactors down, one reactor up and the two rings.<br>杰克：<br>您公布过最新系统的蓝图，上面一个下面三个，下面三个反应器，上面一个反应器，还有两个吊环。</p>
<p>The six balls in the middle and the twelve outside.<br>中央有六个球，外面有十二个球。</p>
<p>And I don’t know why but I don’t to change my system. I decided to keep the three systems and when I have the three systems connected together. And me I put in the middle and make the 4th reactor, you know, the 4th system. It’s become really powerful.<br>我不知道原因，但我不改变我的系统，我决定保留三个系统，当我让这三个系统连接在一起，还有我，我加入中间，成为第四个反应器，您知道，第四个系统，这样就变得真正强大。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:<br>Now what is important is that … does not matter where and how you position your systems. The position or … the reality is where the 4th one sits.<br>凯史：<br>现在，重要的是，不要担心在什么地方用什么方法安置你的系统。这个位置或……真正的位置就是第四个的位置。</p>
<p>And your emotion is the 4th one! … Not your physical body.<br>你的情感就是那第四个！而不是你的物理身体。</p>
<p>What are we going to do hopefully in the coming days: We will take this to step further.<br>我们满怀希望，接下来几天，我们将要让这个系统向前推进一步。</p>
<p>01:45:01<br>I have built systems like this before and in the coming time we’ll use these systems for a specific purpose in Switzerland. What we are going to do is to bring a man out of coma using this system. I know there are some people listening they know exactly because I have discussed [??? short sound cut] where it’s going to go.<br>之前我们已经制造了一些类似的系统，往后，我们要在瑞士用这些系统达成一个特别的目的，我们将要做的是用这个系统把一个人从昏迷中带出来。我知道有些人在听，他们正好知道，因为我们讨论过[……]它将去的地方。</p>
<p>You can still share. You don’t need to stop.<br>你可以继续分享，你不要停下来。</p>
<p>So what it is is: If the man in his emotion wants to come alive [he] will receive the energy for him to wake up.<br>那么，如果那个人的情感想继续活下来，他将接收到让他醒过来的能量。</p>
<p>We see a bright light in the middle of your picture. Is that the sun shining in?<br>我们看见亮光在你的画面的中间，那是太阳光吗？</p>
<p>Jacky: Yes, absolutely.<br>杰克：是的，正是的。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:<br>So what we see and what we are heading for is irrelevance … [???sound cut] … the system but having a condition of a star formation. In how you can … your emotion becomes a 4th section.<br>凯史：<br>所以，我们看到我们正在朝着这些技节问题……[声音断开]……但是系统具有星体结构的条件，以你的方式……你的情感成为第四个部分。</p>
<p>All the stars, even when you look at in your amino-acid are not the same. You have a Nitrogen (N), Carbon (C), Oxygen (O) and Hydrogen (H). So they have a different position, structure and number of atoms and molek … (what you call it) protons and electrons.<br> 所有的恒星，甚至你观察你的氨基酸也不一样，有氮（N）、碳（C）、氧（O）、氢（H），它们有不同的位置、结构、不同的原子量和分子量，……（你们叫什么）不同的质子数和电子数。</p>
<p>So in the way you do once you setup a three structure which are built together, they behave as one.<br>所以这样，你一次设置将三个装置搭建在一起，它们的表现就象一个。</p>
<p>And then you become the 4th one if you want to be connect to it.<br>然后，你就成为第四个，如果你想与它连接。</p>
<p>In this process you will understand a lot of things. That you become the system. You are part of the system. And if your wish is to change let’s say [to] aggression, the rest will not allow you, because this is not what they can do, this is not what they can receive. And then they teach you to lose your aggression. That does not exist. If you go through other way, that does not exist, too.<br>在这个过程中你将理解很多事情，你变成了系统，你成为系统的一部分，如果你的愿望是去改变，比如说是去侵略，其余的[那三个]将不允许你，因为这是它们不能做的，这是它们不能接受的，然后他们教你放弃侵略。这不会实现，如果你通过其它渠道来达到，也不会实现。</p>
<p>Jacky tells you, what has happened in the house with you lot emotionally, you were telling me.<br>杰克告诉你们，你在房子里倾注许多情感，将会发生什么，你告诉过我的。</p>
<p>Jacky: Yes it’s a … if you want a … another person can give his feeling, his emotion …<br>杰克：是的，是……如果你想……另一个人能分享他的感觉，他的情感……</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Yes, please, because it’s not just you, we have somebody else who’s participating …<br>凯史：是的，可以，因为不只是你，我们还有一些参与者……</p>
<p>Jacky: She want’s to speak in French and I will translate.<br>杰克：她要用法语来说，我翻译。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Yes, carry on, please. Can you introduce who she is, please?<br>凯史：好，继续，请吧。你能介绍一下她吗？</p>
<p>Jacky: Yes, it’s Janique???, Switzerland. She wants to say hello in French.<br>[01:48:22 Janique is speaking French now, I cannot understand what she says.]<br>杰克：<br>她是珍尼克，瑞士人，她要用法语问好。<br>[珍尼克说法语……]</p>
<p>Jacky: Yes, she said, she is happy to be there. She said “Love” … a lot of emotions, really, really, really strong emotion. … Coming back to the truth … the true meaning of life … and she is a little bit sad, some sadness, she sees this planet, so to come from this … and then she had the feeling … regain her potential of creation of being the creator and can create what she wants.<br>杰克：好，她说，她很高兴来这里。她说“爱”……很多感动，真情，强烈的感情，……回归真实，意思是生命的真实，……她还说有一小点悲伤，她看到这个星球，从……来，她有一种感觉，恢复造物主赋予她的潜能，她能够创造她所想。</p>
<p>This is the goal for the life and this is ??? for Janique.<br>这是生命的目标，是珍尼克的……</p>
<p>What I can say: There is another person.<br>接下来是，这是另一个人说的。</p>
<p>01:50:00 - 01:55:00<br>01:50:00<br>It’s a young lady, she has 20 years … and during a session ??? are crying because it’s so much emotion. It’s really emotional. Lot, lot, lot of emotion.<br>是一位年轻女士，她20岁，……在整个学习期间，[她]在哭泣，因为，太多感动，真正被感动，太多太多太多感动。</p>
<p>And then the next day she’s really depressive, she had a lot, lot, lot of crying of emotions.<br>第二天她真的很压抑，她因为太多太多感动而哭泣。</p>
<p>And then she goes really better and she started to understand what’s happened and now she is really, really happy. She’s listening to us, she’s in the course. Not in this house but she is listening to this workshop and she fell in a lot of emotions.<br>然后，她好些了，她开始理解发生了什么，现在，她真的真的很快乐，她在听我们的课，她在课程上，没在这屋子里，但她在听这个课程，她觉得在很很多的感动中。</p>
<p>Another lady, beautiful lady was so, so, so emotional, she really understand with what we are really dealing, you know? When we start dealing with the plasma world and the true power of the creation , all your fears become and all your … it’s like if you want to have an idea, picture it’s like when you focus your eyes in the sund, you know, it’s so much energy … it’s difficult to stay in front, but it’s beautiful, you know?<br>另一位女士，漂亮女士，有太多太多太多的感动，她真正的明白我们正在做的交易，你知道？当我们开始拿等离子体世界交易，造物的真正的力量，你所有的恐惧成为，你所有的……就好像你想找出一个创意，画面就像当你把眼神集中在[声音？]上，你知道，这么多能量，……难以面对，但是很美丽，你明白？</p>
<p>And now she realizes the true meaning of the plasma technology.<br>But it’s … yeah, it’s difficult to confront, you know?<br>现在，她意识到这是真正的等离子体技术。<br>但是，这……这难以面对，你知道？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:Thank you very much, Jacky.<br>The interesting point is that I know one thing:<br>The way we showed you the pen and you all run to make the pens.<br>The way we showed the pads and you all run to make the pads.<br>When you saw the Magrav system, you all run to make the Magrav system.<br>凯史：非常感谢，杰克。<br>我知道一件很有趣的事情：<br>我们向你们展示止痛笔，你们都跑去做止痛笔。<br>我们向你们展示止痛垫，你们都跑去做止痛垫。<br>当你们看到等离子体系统，你们都跑去做等离子体系统。</p>
<p>Now with this demonstration, you have the blueprint how to become a man of peace.<br>现在，借助这个示范，你就有了怎样让人们来到和平的蓝图。</p>
<p>Not to eat other things and animals and gradually go through the process.<br>不吃别的东西或动物，逐渐地通过这个过程。</p>
<p>This is shocking for a lot of governments, this will be shocking for a lot of world leaders who were planning a lot of wars and killing. Because all you need to do is what I said before:<br>这让许许多多的政府震惊，也将让许许多多那些正在策划战争和杀戮的世界领导们震惊。因为，你们都需要这样做，我以前说过：</p>
<p>If you produce enough Magrav systems we will enforce the change. Keshefoundation stands for PEACE. ONE Nation, ONE Planet, ONE Race. And we start the process today.<br>如果你们生产足够多的等离子系统，我们将实施转变。凯史基金会立足于实现和平，一个国家，一个星球，一个种族。今天，我们开始了这个进程。</p>
<p>We carry on for a time being with the present physical condition but underneath we start bringing the change.<br>一个时段内我们继续呈现物理条件，但是，在下面我们开始带来转变。</p>
<p>As many as you as you can create these systems and understand how each star formation becomes an independent unit on its own and then when you put the three star formations to become part of the lot and then you become the 4th.<br>你们很多人都能建立这些系统，理解每一个星体结构成为独立的单元，然后，你把三个星体结构设置形成一体，然后，你成为那第四个。</p>
<p>Everybody else is the 4th. But the beauty of it is that you will connect. The beauty of it is that we have started the true World Peace by not even eating another animal.<br>每个人都是那第四个，美丽之处是你将跟它连接，美丽之处是我们开始真实的世界和平，不再吃别的动物。</p>
<p>I see Ali, he says: “I’m here, I want to show … “. He is so impatient. Come on Ali, show us …just wait a second … Jacky, can you stop sharing, please? Don’t go anywhere, Jacky, because I got something for you, you ‘re going to be surprised.<br>我看见阿里，阿里说：“我在这里，我要展示……”，他很着急，来吧阿里，给我们展示……等一下……杰克，你能停止共享吗？不要走，杰克，因为，我带给你一些东西，你将会惊喜。</p>
<p>Jacky: Another people with aahm in France can speak, if you want, after.<br>杰克：另一个人可以讲，用法语，如果您想听，稍后。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Ok, we leave it. Do not change anything. Stay there.<br>Come on Ali, we can change. You can speak.<br>凯史：好，我离开，不要改变任何东西，留在这里。<br>快点阿里，我们能改变，你可以讲了。</p>
<p>Ali: Ok, i’m just changing it to my video. So this is a kind of a change that I made, I got a couple of rings on the top and using the free plasma coils that we already made, we just had to put it on in the 12 outer ring format.<br>阿里：OK，我要改变一下我的视频。所以，这是我创造的一种改变，我在上面用了一两个吊环，利用自由等离子体线圈，我已经做成了。我们只要把它放在12个外围环的上面。</p>
<p>And we got 6 in the middle and there is three of them, a star formation in the middle<br>然后，我放置6个在里面，这是它们中的三个，星体结构在中间。</p>
<p>01:55:00<br>And they’re hooked up kind of outer in the serial format.<br>它们和外围的串连结构钩连。</p>
<p>So one of us testing out the voltage and everything when I do the serial connection it increases as it moves to the next coil. So, for example it starts at this coil …<br>我们测试之一，不带电压，我形成这些串连连接，它的增加相当于它移动到下一个线圈，举例来说，从这个线圈开始……</p>
<p>and basically the middle coil is … out here is connected to the batteries, there is a lot them here<br>以中间线圈为基础……这边与电池连接，这里有很多电池。</p>
<p>and the outer one keeps going into the … like the negative to the positive, the negative to the positive going around.<br>外围的一个一个持续进入……好像负数对正数，负数对正数形成流转。</p>
<p>Then the inner one becomes opposite direction, so if if this thing goes counter clockwise, the inner one rotates clockwise. And then again goes into the center …<br>然后，内圈一个直接与之对应，所以，如果这个是逆时针，内圈那个就是顺时针，然后，再次进入中心……</p>
<p>… it goes counterclockwise again in a serial format and it feeds to the center on the top …<br>在串连结构中，这个按逆时针流动，通过顶部馈入中心……</p>
<p>which is a kind of an “upside down coil” in the middle.<br>就是在中间的这种上下倒置的线圈。<br>And then it’s hooked up to the ground goes into the ground.<br>然后，它与地面钩连进入地面。</p>
<p>…<br> And the battery is ??? between the ground and feeds into the first starting point.<br>这个电池……在地面之间，然后又馈入第一个起始点。</p>
<p>And when I use these voltmeters that I have and I put it close to these wires, there is a lot of noise. So it means there is current running through.<br>我用这些伏特计，我让这些线闭合，检测到有许多噪声，说明有涌流通过。</p>
<p>When I tap into the system, I tried the water thing like I was thirsty this morning and I wanted to get some water, there is a phase in like you tune in and what happens, that kind of your mind goes blank … a few seconds.<br>当我连接进入这个系统，我试着找水，像这个早上我口喝，我想找些水，有一个时段，好像你调谐，发生大脑进入一片空白，几秒钟。</p>
<p>And then connections establishes with your body, your GANS ??? with the field and there is like a communication takes place. Ok, “I need this” and then there is an energy transference that you can feel that comes into your body as a result. I think it might be nano particles … and I tried it 3 or 4 times, tried it with different fruits, different drinks or somewhat. Every time I tune in, I have a kind of a blank-out for three or four seconds my mind goes blank.<br>然后，与你的身体的连接建立，与你的甘斯[？？？]的场像是有一种沟通发生。OK，“我需要这个”，然后，有一股能量转移，结果是你能感觉到进入你的身体，我想也许是纳米粒子……我试了3或4次，用不同的水果试，用不同的饮料或一些什么，每次我调谐，我有一种空白，3-4秒钟进入一种空白状态。</p>
<p>And then my body tunes in, there is a communication and ??? receive some energy through it.<br>然后，我的身体调谐，有一种沟通，[？？？]通过这个系统收到一些能量。</p>
<p>第五部分<br>Mr. Keshe:Do you feel and taste it?<br>凯史先生：你能感觉和品尝到它吗？<br>Ali:  Ahm … for me … I do get visuals, the minute …??? even when you sleep, when I sleep, I have a really, really good sleep and I see all these levels … light particles traveling to my bedroom on top of me and I basically start being a sleeping in a really warm blanket. It really feels comfortable and really good because I used a lot of sea GANSes, different kind of sea GANSes in it. It’s like being close even to the ocean.  So it’s a really, really calmly good feeling warm blanket feel, Hehe.<br>Ali:嗯……对我来说……我得到的视觉效果，一……就。。？？？即使你睡着了，当我睡着的时候，我有一个非常、非常好的睡眠，我看到所有这些层次……在我的卧室上方有光离子在游动，我就像是躺在一个非常温暖的毛毯上。感觉真的非常舒服因为我用了许多海水（制造的）甘斯，各种不同的海水甘斯在里面。这就像在海洋里面。这是一种非常舒服，非常温暖的被包裹的感觉，呵呵。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Do you feel and taste it?<br>凯史先生：你能感觉和品尝到它吗？<br>But have felt from an eating point of view, your system is totally different than Jackys.<br>但从饮食的角度看，你的系统完全不同于Jacky的系统。<br>Ali:From the feeling point of view … anytime I ask for anything, when my mind tunes in there is a blank-out that my mind goes blank for a second. It’s like I establish a connection and then within my own body I see connecting with the coils and with the nano particles and then there is a transfer of energy. And after that I was thirsty and then when I did that, it’s kind of subsided and I don’t feel that thirsty anymore. But I would like to experience more because I just finished this last night, I would like to experience a bit more with different kinds of fruit and see if I can go without food like at nights or so, when I get back home to see what are the effects of doing that and then see where it goes.<br>Ali:从感受的角度来看……任何时候我要求任何事情，当我的意识调整到这里的时候，我的大脑一片空白。这就像我建立了连接，然后在我自己的身体内我看到与线圈与纳米粒子的连接然后是能量的转变。在那之后我感觉口渴，当我这么做的时候，它减弱了，我再也没有任何口渴的感觉。但我想体验更多因为我昨晚刚刚完成这个，我想体验更多不同种类的水果看看如果我能否在晚上不吃食物，当我回到家看看这样做的效果，然后看到它在那里。<br>02:00:04<br>And also there is some development on communication over distances. There is a … ??? … that slowly is becoming developed so there are some people that even before they call me or something I see them in my minds eye or I hear their voice which is quite strange but interesting at the same time. It has happened few times with even different people in different parts of the world or I do get a visual a bit before they even thinking about me or something and then it happens in the center of the brain and it’s like having a little TV in the center of your brain and that becomes your point of communication and listening also.<br>而且这里有一些超距离的感应，这是一个……？？？……慢慢变得发达像有些人甚至在他们叫我之前或者诸如此类，我就可以在我的心里听到，或者我听到他们的声音，有时候那是相当奇怪而又有趣的感觉。这种现象在世界上很稀有，只发生在少数特殊的人身上或者甚至在他们想我之前我就得到一个栩栩如生的视觉形象诸如此类，它发生在大脑的中心就好像是那里有一台微型电视，这变成是你的感应通信和倾听点。<br>So there is a lot of changes happening in a certain level. And I’m just learning as I go through.<br>所以这是在某一层面的一些转变。仅仅是通过我的学习带来的。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Ok, thank you very much. When I looked at your picture from the top you’ve taken, it looks like an UFO. … ready for lift.<br>Thanks very much, thank you, Ali.<br>凯史先生：OK,非常感谢。我从上面看到你的图片，你已经采取了，它看起来像一个UFO….<br>准备起飞。<br>What I would like to do: We go back to Jacky.<br>现在我想，我们返回Jacky那里。<br>Jacky, can we come and join you in your little hot?<br>Jacky，我们可以加入到你的视频吗？<br>Can you put your camera on?<br>你可以吧你的摄像机向上面移动一点吗？</p>
<p>And what I want to do:<br>我想要做：<br>We should be able to see the 3 cores if it’s possible, if you can go back enough.<br>What we try to do:<br>如果可能的话我们应该能够看见三个核心，如果你能够回去，我们试着做：<br>I know as I said, a lot of you will start this process. A lot of you going to show if it’s correct or not or if we can make it or not, if it works. Very much what you did with everything else..<br>我知道当我说,你们很多人将开始这个进程.许多你们正在展示的不管它是正确的与否或者如果我们能够制造它或者不能,如果它成功, 你所做的一切都是非常有意义的.<br>The essential is to produce systems very much like the one in the middle.<br>实质是为了制造出系统很像在这中间.</p>
<p>Which is hanging with the control.<br>那个是悬挂的控制器.</p>
<p>Once you achieved these systems … you already have systems built on this basis. You can position them in a way where you feel comfortable they have to be.<br>当你完成这些系统…你已经有系统建立在这个基础之上.你可以把它们放在适当的位置在某种程度上它们会给你带来舒适的感觉.<br>Then what’ll be interesting is if you start absorbing energy as you need from the environment of the system. It’ll be very good if you can sit in the middle, once to start with. That you connect with.<br>如果你开始有从这些系统的环境里吸收到你所需要的能量,那将是极有趣的.如果你能坐在这中间,它将是非常美好的体验,一旦开始,你会产生连接.</p>
<p>But what will be interesting is how much you can go and transfer the energy and the emotion to the others without them knowing you’re feeding them.<br>有趣的是你可以将能量和情感转移给其他人, 但他们尚不知道你在喂养他们。<br>You go out, buy food and give the man who goes hungry.<br>你过去购买食物给饥饿的人.<br>Now you take your emotion and you carry through your system to him. That you tell him: “Whenever you think hungry, you’ll see what comes to you.”<br>现在你带上你的情感和你的装置系统, 你告诉他：“每当你觉得饿的时候，你看看它会给你带来什么”<br>What to follow this it will be very interesting, to do such a test.<br>做这样的测试将会是非常有趣的。<br>A lot of you are watching this system, it’s life.<br>在你们许多人眼里它是装置，其实它是生命。<br>What I would like to do is to invite all of you for breakfast if you are in United States, dinner if you are in East Asia and maybe lunch if you are around London area in that part [of the world].<br>我想邀请你们吃早餐,如果你在美国就是午餐，如果你在东亚也许就是晚餐,如果你在伦敦的某个地方[世界]。<br>So, let us all eat and see how we feel. Let us all see if we can take what we need even though we might not feel it with our emotion.<br>现在，让我们所有人来吃，看看有什么样的感觉。让我们看看我们是否能够各取所需，即使我们可能无法感受到你的情绪。<br>But let us know by Thursday how you felt. Think of what we did last night. We gonna do this test again tonight. We will carry on with this test for the time will come.<br>但是，让我们在周四知道你的感受。想昨晚我们所做的，今晚我们还要做这个测试。我们会抽时间继续这个测试。<br>What you need to do, what I would like to do if any of you can be there, you don’t need to concentrate, you just need to be able to link, if it can be done.<br>你需要做的是，我想如果你能够在那儿，你不需要聚精会神，你只需要能够连接，如果你能够做到的话。<br>I would like you to think to eat your favorite starter. Chew it. It could be a salad, it could be anything, … bread with butter.<br>我希望你想着你最喜爱的一道菜，咀嚼它。它可能是沙拉，也可能是任何菜，……。面包 抹上奶油。<br>Then what I would like you to do is to sit down and have a nice meal. Have whatever you like.<br>那么我想你将坐在那里享受到美妙的一餐。<br>A chips, a fish, steak, piece of bread … I never understood by the girl wanted just a melon as dinner. But chew it, that you get the feel of it.<br>一包薯片，一条鱼，牛排，面包片……我从来不理解为什么那些女孩只需要一条甜瓜做午餐，但是请咀嚼它，你将拥有那样的感觉。<br>02:05:01<br>Then have your dessert. Eat what you like, that it gives you the mixture right for what you need for your body. A pudding, ice-cream, a fruit salad, whatever you think. Don’t forget: A lot of hungry people what you do is to them a phantasy will never come true. Now they can have what you ever had.<br>现在开始餐后甜点。吃你喜欢的，它能给你身体平衡的营养。一个布丁，冰淇淋，水果沙拉，无论什么。不要忘记：许多饥饿的人这样做时只是在幻想而绝不能够成为现实，现在他们可以真正地获得食物的能量。<br>When you leave these systems in the churches and the mosques and the squares, they will have the most beautiful foods they could only dream about. Now they know the taste of and the energy of it.<br>如果你离开这些装置，在教堂里或者穆斯林清真寺广场，最美好的食物对他们来说只能是梦想。现在通过这个装置他们能感受到食物的味道和能量。<br>Tell them “We like you to do is to have a drink. Have a water. Please do not touch alcohol, because you gonna totally crazy with it.”<br>告诉他们：“我们希望你拥有饮料，水，但请不要尝试酒精，因为你可能喝醉而疯狂。<br>And then, what do you do usually, a lot of us?<br>那么，通常你想做什么？你们许多人？<br>The doctor says: “Take your pills after the dinner.”<br>医生常说：“饭后拿上你的药丸。”<br>Now if you have a pain, if you have a cancer, if you are Alzheimer’s, if you have Prakinson: Think about what you don’t want to have and receive the energy for it not to have.<br>现在，如果你有疼痛，如果你有癌症，如果你有老年痴呆，如果你有帕金森症：想想你不希望的，它没有接收能量。<br>Just enough energy that you can walk away without it. And if you haven’t received any of the feelings or emotions … you never know, build your own system and try it.<br>你有足够的能量可以摆脱这些病症。如果你还没有接收到任何的情感或情绪……你永远不了解，建造你自己的装置并且测试它。<br>But this is the path to the freedom of man from tangible life. But those of you who set out from today to build this system to achieve this:<br>但这是人类从有形生命通往自由的路径。你们必须从今天开始建造这个装置来达成这个目标。<br>Understand your agreement and your contract.<br>请理解你的协议和合同。<br>This is where your World Peace Treaty comes into operation. There is no way return. Those of you somewhere in the middle panic that “I want to stop!”. It’ll be very hard to do so. The only way you can do is to drink huge amounts of water. Huge amounts of water. Because you have to reset the energy of the body.<br>这是从你你签署世界和平公约开始生效的。这是不能回头的。 那些中途因为恐慌而说“我想停止”的，这是很难做到的。你唯一能做的就是喝大量的水，大量的水。因为你需要重置你的身体的能量。<br>So those of you who are not in that market: Do not try this.<br>所以你们这样做是没有市场的：不要尝试这样做。<br>But those of you who want to get to states of not eating another animal to become a true, true harmless person, because …<br>但那些想要不去吃其他动物而成为一个真正无害的人，因为……<br>I sit on the tables and I laugh at myself by the time to death.<br>这个时候我坐在桌子旁我自己极度想要发笑。<br>The [??? sorry, one word not understandable for me, please help] says: “I’m a vegetarian. I don’t like to eat animals.”</p>
<p>【？？？抱歉，我有一个词不明白，请帮助】有人说：“我是一个素食主义者，我不喜欢吃动物”<br>And I tell them: “You are eating an animal worse than the other one. There you kill one animal. Now you kill hundreds, because the lettuce, the salad, the tomato and the cucumber count how many animals you have. So in the space we don’t become vegetarian and we don’t become meat eater and we don’t become whatever, “I only eat raw and I don’t eat anything else.”<br>我告诉他们：“你比吃一个动物更糟糕，你本来只杀掉一个动物，现在你要杀死数百头动物，因为这些生菜，这些沙拉，这些西红柿和这些黄瓜可以养活多少动物。所以，在这个时空里我们不能成为素食者，不能成为肉食动物，不能成为诸如此类，“我只吃生的，不吃任何东西”。<br>Now we become the true man of the space: We do not take, we do not eat any entity.<br>现在我们成为这个空间里真正的人类：我们不获取，我们不吃任何实体。<br>Which has a life and we start having respect for true life. This is the change.<br>那些有生命的，我们开始尊重和关心真实的生命。这是真正改变。<br>If some of you did not get enough, you can have a second portion of dessert. Another dessert.<br>如果你还没有吃饱的话，你可以再来一份餐后甜点。<br>Because don’t forget: What you wish to eat is what your body is short of.<br>因为别忘了：你想要吃的就是你的身体缺少的。<br>So when you eat something or you decide to eat something is what your body is short of. So when you think of eating lets say whatever … a tomato is what is the energy of that tomato which is missed in your body. That’s what we call “craving”. But the problem will change from now on.<br>因此当你吃东西或者你决定吃什么就是你的身体所缺少的，因此当你想吃无论什么……一个西红柿，是因为你的身体需要西红柿的能量。这就是我们所谓的“渴望”。但是，这个问题将从现在开始改变。<br>You don’t crave, the only thing man will crave is for Peace.<br>你不需要渴望，你唯一需要渴望的是人类的和平。<br>Because you see it. You become peaceful. You don’t understand what the other says “You’re so angry. Just have a unit, just leave it in the kitchen.”<br>因为你看到它，你成为充满和平的人。你不明白其他人说“你那么愤怒，仅仅因为有一个单元，只是把它留在厨房里”<br>You don’t need so elaborate systems. You can make a star formation, three that you become the 4th one.<br>你不需要那么精心制作的装置。你可以制作一个星体组合，你就成为第四代人类（注：不确定4th one的含义，请知道的朋友补充）。<br>You don’t need the top. You can make three cores in the base that you can connect to become the 4th one.<br>你不需要顶部，你可以做三个核心在下面，你就可以连接成为第四代人类。（注：不确定4th one的含义，请知道的朋友补充）。<br>The innovation center will release a blueprint for this. We call this the “Blueprint of Peace”.<br>创新中心会释放这个蓝图。我们管这个叫作“和平蓝图”。<br>02:10:00<br>We showed you the blueprint of the spaceship.<br>我们已经给你们展示太空飞船蓝图。<br>Now this is the “Blueprint of Peace”.<br>现在这是“和平蓝图”。<br>Where you will not eat and you don’t become only green eater animal than the red eater animal.<br>在这里你不需要吃东西以及你也不可变成只吃绿色植物的素食者和吃红色的动物的肉食者。<br>Any questions?<br>有什么问题要问吗？<br>Rick: Thank you Mr. Keshe. There are a couple of viewers that have questions. Here’s Heather Bryant has some questions for you, maybe she can go ahead. I promote her to panellist there.<br>Rick:谢谢你凯史先生。这里有两三个人要提问。是希瑟·布赖恩有一些问题问你，也许她可以继续。我让他加入到这里。<br>Heather Bryant, are you there? Do you like to speak?<br>希瑟·布赖恩，你在听吗？你喜欢这个谈话吗？<br>Heather Bryant:<br>Yes, I think I found the un-mute button finally.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：是的，我想我终于找到静音键了。<br>Hello, I’m a physical therapist in the United States and have been following these awesome teachings since October and many ideas how to integrate this technology in the healthcare field.<br>Hello,我是一名来自美国的理疗师，从十月起跟随这个的教学，我有许多想法如何将这种技术运用在医疗保健领域。<br>Oh my god, hihi.<br>天啊，嘻嘻。<br>Part of my question this morning is kind of how to start to integrate that in a way that the (you know) say a place like …..and they’re doing traditional medicine and how to start to integrate that, yes.<br>我的问题的一部分，是今天早上想如何开始整合通过什么途径（你知道）说一个地方就像……如何开始整合他们做传统医学的，是的。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Very easy. Don’t tell no one nothing.<br>凯史先生：<br>非常容易。别告诉他们任何事情。<br>You got also [ ??? Heather is laughing, two or three of Mr. Keshe’s words cannot be heard ]<br>你也有[？?? 希瑟走运，这里有凯史先生两三个词没听清]<br>Just make yourself 3 Magrav systems, put a bouquet of flowers on top of it, they look at the flowers and don’t see what’s underneath, they think it’s a part of the plant pot.<br>只需要制作你自己的三层能量单元装置，把一束鲜花放在上面，他们看到鲜花看不到下面是什么，他们想它是一个花盆。<br>[ ??? Heather says “Right”, two or three of Mr. Keshe’s words cannot be heard ].<br>【？？？希瑟说“好的”，这里有凯史先生两三个词没听清】<br>And they call that a “Happy Room”. You understand?<br>他们称之为“快乐房间”。你明白吗？<br>Heather Bryant: I understand.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：我明白。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>So you don’t need … you find people will start walking, they call it the “Miracle Room”, they all come in. Whoever goes in this room … You know there is a room in the hospital [??? one or two words not heard correctly] … old people say “Anywhere who goes in that room dies, we don’t want to be there”.<br>凯史先生：所以你不需要……你会发现人们开始散步，他们称之为“奇迹房间”，他们都进来。谁会在这个房间里……你知道这是医院里面的房间【？？？两三个词没听清】……老人说“谁谁刚在那个房间去世，我们不要去那个房间”<br>I’ve been there, I know what I’m talking about.<br>我去过那里，我知道我说的是什么。<br>So, you make a room that everybody wants to go. Whoever goes in there goes home.<br>所以，你营造了一个所有人都愿意去的房间。相比于回家，他们更愿意去这个房间。<br>What we are going to do even with the case we have in different countries. We can make conditions the same as what we said. You can make conditions, environments where the man becomes the core, the 4th core.<br>我们所要做的是即使我们在不同的国家，我们可以创造同样的环境，你可以创造条件，你在环境中成为核心，第四代人类｛？｝核心。<br>You need to place three in the room. Doesn’t matter, how low it is. Hydrogen is not the same as the Oxygen and the Oxygen is not the same as Nitrogen and not the same as Carbon, but together somehow they accommodate [??? one word too fast spoken] to make the amino-acid that they are all comfortable.<br>你需要放置三个装置在这个房间里。无所谓，它们能量有多低，氢和氧是不一样的和碳是不一样的和氮是不一样的，但不知何故它们相互适应【？？？一个口语太快】制造出氨基酸它们都是很舒适的。<br>In one position you might become Nitrogen, when you walking in and the other one the Oxygen, but you find the balance inside you to be able to interact with the three.<br>在某个位置，你有可能成为氮，当你走进另一个地方你又成为氧，但是你总是能够在这三者之间找到平衡平衡。<br>Heather Bryant:<br>Oh yes, so you talking three of the 3-stacker original units from back in November? That type of a thing, or … ?<br>希瑟·布赖恩：<br>噢是的，所以从十一月以来？你总是谈论三层堆栈式能量单元这样一件事情，或者……？<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yes, you can do that.<br>凯史先生：是的，你可以做那个。<br>But then you have one single core. The development you will see the difference is with the new what I call “Universal Core”, where you put the gravitational and magnetical and just hide it inside.<br>但是当你有一个单层的线圈，去发展它，你会看到不同的新的效果，这就是我称之为“通用核心”，你仅仅是把引力弹簧藏在磁力弹簧里面。<br>Nobody knows.<br>无人知晓。<br>Because don’t get deceived or don’t get … go wrong with it is that …<br>因为没有欺骗或者什么……如果出错那是……<br>The matter-state is irrelevant.<br>物质状态是无关紧要的。<br>Doesn’t matter if you put it in a box or in a plastic or in a wooden box, whatever … the field goes beyond the dimension of the system.<br>无所谓如果你把它放到盒子里或者一个塑料盒或者木头盒子里，无论什么……它的领域将会穿越这个系统的维度。<br>Heather Bryant: Does the box need to be nano-coated? The container? No.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：这些盒子需要纳米涂层吗？这些容器或者不需要？<br>Mr. Keshe:Please do not do that because then you confine the limitation but make sure it has a energy plasma unit that it can feed itself with energy. You need a plasma battery/capacitor that … can feed …<br>凯史先生：请不要那样做因为相当于你把它限制在里面，但是你可以产生一个等离子体能量单元，它可以给自己供能，自给自足。<br>[ ??? Heather speaks in between, some of Mr. Keshe’s words cannot be heard ]<br>【？？？这中间有话筒干扰，凯史先生一些词听不清】<br>Heather Bryant: … that of those in the work right now.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：…那么立即开展工作.<br>Mr. Keshe:Yes. You need 3 of those in the work. Because if you don’t, they need to take from you and give back. So, you’ll find out: If you make rooms or you can put three or four all over the place you’ll find out the whole place where you work will change.<br>凯史先生:是的。你需要三个核心单元来工作，因为如果你不那么做，它们需要从你那里得到回馈。所以，你会发现：如果你把三个或者四个都放在一个房间里你会发现你的工作将会使整个地方都会发生转变。<br>Heather Bryant:So we’re talking one of those Universal 90/90 coils with three battery plasma capacitors?<br>希瑟·布赖恩：所以我们说一个通用90/90线圈有三个等离子体电池电容吗?</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:You are very technical. Yes, please!<br>凯史先生：你非常专业。是的，就这么做。<br>Heather Bryant:Hahaha, I want to play with it, haha.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：哈哈哈，我想要它来玩，哈哈<br>Also I was seeing possibilities using the GANS packs, you know, put it in a chair with the persons sits in bicycles for 15 minutes you know, before I get all this other stuff made. You can put it in the base of the man that had a paralyzed leg and have him stand with the little GANS pack in there for 15-20 minutes while you stand. So many possibilities.<br>我也看到使用甘斯包的各种可能性，你知道，把它放在（残疾人）自行车的座凳上然后坐在上面15分钟，你知道，之前我做的一切其他东西，你可以吧甘斯包放在残疾人瘫痪的肢体下面15到20分钟，他当时就可以站起来了。有如此多的可能性。<br>02:15:04<br>Mr. Keshe:You have to understand what’s the reason of the paralysis.<br>We go in the Space-Health-Teaching using of the system for health purposes from this week on.<br>凯史先生：你还要理解致使他瘫痪的原因。我们回顾本周的医疗健康教学讲的使用这个系统的目的。<br>Because now we enter a total different dimension of the process. Try …<br>因为我们现在全面地进入了一个不同的进程。试验……。<br>Heather Bryant:。Oh I want to know more about the stroke person and how to … restore …<br>希瑟·布赖恩：噢，我想知道更多关于如何使中风病人……恢复……<br>Mr. Keshe:Yes, if you have a stroke person, try to understand what was the reason of the stroke.<br>凯史先生：是的，如果你有中风的病人，尝试弄明白中风的原因。<br>And then you leave them in the room with the system let them to sit right in the middle of it. Mark a chair somewhere which you think is about the right place for them to be the 4th core and see how they come.<br>然后你带他们到有这个装置的房间请他们坐在中间适当的位置上。把做好标记的椅子放在某个地方，你想着这是为他们to be the 4th core（这句不懂，请高手补充）看看他们是怎么走到正确的地方。<br>Just tell them: “Would you like some water?” [Heather is laughing heartily]<br>And then let them see if they can taste the water.<br>只需要告诉他们：“你想要一些水吗？”【希瑟哈哈大笑】<br>     然后请他们看看他们是否能够喝到这个水。<br>“Would you like some orange?” Tell them “Did  you have orange, did you just smell orange?”<br>“你想要一些橙子吗？”告诉他们“你想得到橙子，还是只想要闻到橙子的香味？”<br>And they all come there to sit in that chair.<br>然后他们都会走过来坐到那个椅子上。<br>Heather Bryant:<br>Yes, they have a sit step to receiving.<br>是的，他们有一个步骤来接收。<br>Mr. Keshe:Yes, and then depends on how close your systems are, you start building it with them. And try it! Now all try the power units and the pencils, now you try what we call the “System of Universe”. For you to become man of Universe.<br>凯史先生：是的，然后取决于如何运用你的装置，你开始建造它们。测试它，现在试着做能量单元和止痛笔，现在你测试我们所谓的“宇宙的装置”。为你成为宇宙人类。<br>So we’ll see if your patients just walk out and they come back or they go in a way they don’t like to eat and the hospital or your people who look after them says “There is something wrong. This guy is not eating anymore, he’s going to die, but he’s walking and dancing”, one or the others.<br>所以我们将看到如果你的病人刚刚站起来并恢复或者在某种程度上他们变得不喜欢吃东西和去医院或者你所照顾的人他们会说：“这里一定有些事情是错的。这个家伙再也不吃任何东西，他将要死去，但是他现在可以走路和跳舞了”<br>Heather Bryant:Answer me this quick question. My question always comes background to the ethos of interacting with another person that is going through a you know ??? disease that they have created for their own personal transformation. I feel like there may [no] … [there] should be some consent or they should know that this different than (you know) what … they normally do or …<br>希瑟·布赖恩：请回答我这个快速的问题。我的问题是这些人总是缺少与他人互动的精神气质你知道？？？因为疾病使他们自己创造了这种转变，我觉得有可能【不】……应该取得他们的同意或者他们应该知道这不同于（你知道的）什么……他们通常所做的或者……<br>Mr. Keshe:You don’t consent. … You don’t need their consent because he only takes what they need. They consent themselves without you doing anything.<br>凯史先生：你不同意，……你不需要他们的同意因为他只是取得他们所需要的。他们同意你不做任何事情。<br>Heather Bryant:But then [or “when” ??? not clearly distinguishable] they consent themselves by coming into the facility and into the therapy room.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：不过【或者“但是当”？？？区别不明显】他们同意使用设施并进入治疗室。<br>Mr. Keshe:Aah gradually it becomes a whole city. You go “This city is a Peace City”. You have to understand, so it’s not a consent it is: Your body takes what it needs and no more.<br>And gives what it don’t needs. You can’t take your life away and if you don’t want to change because “This way is good for me to get my attention”, you’ll stay that way.<br>AHA逐渐成为一个整体的城市。你去到“这个城市是和平的城市”你会明白，所以它不是一个同意不同意的问题，它是“你的身体只是拿走它所需要的而给与它不需要的仅此而已”<br>你不能拿走你的生活方式如果你不想改变，因为“这种方式对我是最好的”。你将留在那边。<br>But the thing is: They receive so much energy that they change psychologically anyway. The bigest problem with this technology when it [??? some words indistinguishable] develops …<br>I have a very bad new for the ones who loans [??? or “owns” not clearly distinguishable] funeral parlors: They going to be a big shortage of bodies. A huge shortage.<br>但是最重要的是：他们接受到如此多的能量总会在心理上发生转变。这项技术最大的问题是当它【？？？一些词不能辨别】发展……。<br>Because now we extend the lifes into hundreds.<br>因为到现在我们这样生活了成百上千年了。<br>Heather Bryant:<br>And a shorter stay for the rehab patients, too.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：<br>短暂的停留也是为了康复这些患者。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Aah in a way we see them [???] in it.<br>They don’t need a rehab, we already rehabilitated into space anyway. You understand?<br>凯史先生：<br>在某种程度上我们将在【？？？】AAH里面看到他们。<br>他们不需要一个康复中心, 我们已经康复到太空中，你明白吗？<br>Heather Bryant:Aah, let me interim: What would be my response, Mr. Keshe, to a person that might challenge AMA (American Medical Association), that might challenge the … you know, we’re supposed to use stuff that is researched, that is certified, that is whatever …<br>希瑟·布赖恩：Aah,如果有人问我：我该怎么说，凯史先生，一个人可能怀疑AMA（美国医疗协会），乃至于怀疑……你知道的，我们应该使用被认证过的，就是说，需要具有证明文件的，不管怎样……<br>Mr. Keshe:Who certified it? Who says …You are certified!<br>Put it this way:<br>The MAGRAV Systems are certified by European Standard.<br>The pens are certified under the Health Standard.<br>You’re already certified!<br>凯史先生：谁来给你颁发证书？谁说的……你需要证书！<br>这样说吧：<br>能量装置是通过欧盟标准认证的。<br>止痛笔是获得健康标准认证的。<br>你已经有了认证！<br>Heather Bryant:<br>Where do I find a copy of that I could present that to …<br>希瑟·布赖恩：<br>我在那里找到一份复印件我可以把它展示到……<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>We will release all these in the coming days. I’ve seen some communication going on with the dispatch and the people who answer …<br>Is Ella available, please? … Ella?<br>凯史先生：我们将会在未来几天发布所有这些。我看看是谁在安排这些事情请他来回答这个问题……<br>是艾拉，请问有空吗？……艾拉？<br>Ella:I’m here!<br>艾拉：我在这里！<br>Mr. Keshe:Hi Ella, what is the position with the release of the certificates, where are we?<br>凯史先生：嗨，艾拉，我们关于释放证书的事情进展到哪里了？<br>Ella:We have the certifications, the question is only for make them public.<br>艾拉：<br>我们有这些证书，现在的问题仅仅是把它公布出来了。<br>Mr. Keshe:Let us discuss with our legal department, we have in-house lawyers within the Keshefoundation. Can you ask the … I will do that tonight. That what is our position.<br>We have full certification. So, European Standard Certification for all the systems as is in our position for the pens and pads and the Magrav Units, so you are following the same thing.<br>凯史先生：<br>让我们与我们的法律部门讨论一下，我们又凯史基金会的内部律师。你可以要求。。，。我今晚来做这件事情。看看我们怎么安排这些。看看这些放在什么位置合适，我们有止痛笔还有止痛垫和能量单元，你可以跟踪这些事情。<br>Heather Bryant:<br>So that would be to be presented to our associations that certify our things?<br>希瑟·布赖恩：所以希望将这些展示在我们协会以证明我们所做的。<br>Mr. Keshe:You can do whatever you like, yes there is no …<br>If anybody asks a question, they say “Oh, this is not American Standard … ”<br>You say “Whatever you like to call it. I move all my patients to Europe.”<br>And they come … [Heather laughs heartily again]<br>凯史先生：你可以这么做，如果你喜欢，是的，这是不……</p>
<p>02:20:01<br>Heather Bryant:Or open a place that provides this type of situation first so that people can see a demonstration of how it works.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：或者开辟一个展示空间，让人们首先看到证明并知道这是如何运作的。<br>Mr. Keshe:You can demonstrate … we demonstrated enough.<br>There are some millions of people who are demonstrating it.<br>凯史先生：<br>你可以展示……们的展示很充分。<br>Heather Bryant:Oh I have no doubt! I just mean to demonstrate …<br>希瑟·布赖恩：噢，我没有问题了！我只是想证明，，，，<br>Mr. Keshe:You have to see that there is no harm done because you take what you need and no more.<br>And so if you take something too much, you have to give a little bit more out and it brings a balance.<br>凯史先生：你要知道，这些装置都是无害的因为你只是取走你需要的而已。<br>那么如果你取走很得越多，你就要给予得更多，这样才能带来平衡。<br>Heather Bryant:<br>Aah, Ok, I know my question. Many of the patients in there have metal implants in their knee, in their hip, those type of things.<br>希瑟·布赖恩：<br>Aah, Ok,我知道我的问题。许多病人在他们的膝盖、臀部有金属植入物，这类东西。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>This does not interact.</p>
<p>第六部分：<br>02:20:35<br>This is a plasmatic field, it does not interact.<br>这个等离子磁场，没有相互作用<br>Heather Bryant:<br>But I remember the patches. We don’t put them over …<br>Heather Bryant:但是我记得这个patch ,我们没有把它们放在…<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yes, you don’t do that. But now this is a plasma condition, is totally in balance with all ???<br>凯史：你不用那样做，这是等离子体状态下，有全面平衡和所有…？？<br>Heather Bryant:<br>Ok. That’s the answer I was looking for.<br>Because the other one had some such questions.<br>Heather Bryant:这就是我寻找的答案，因为另外的一个也有同样的问题<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>These are totally different. In the plates we don’t use it, but in other places, because you create a plasma the body will adjust itself to what it needs, to take, to accommodate what’s in there.<br>凯史：这些完全不同，这个盘片我们没有使用它，但是在其他地方，因为你创建的等离子体，身体会自我调整，需要什么就会去获取，在那里自我适应。<br>Yeah, there is no problem because you are not putting it on, you enter an environment.<br>没有问题因为你不是放上去，而是进入到环境中来。<br>If you put a lot of people with paralysis which the nerve is not cut but is what you call it … under pressure or whatever, you will find these people just walk out even if they are more or less blind. If you adjust the system correctly they will see. They will tell you they will see.<br>如果你把神经麻痹中风患者放入，你会发现这些人甚至是盲人（会健全走出来），，他们会说能看见了，如果你设置正确。<br>Heather Bryant:<br>And the Alzheimer’s [???wheighing ???] excited about what it would do.<br>Heather Bryant:老年痴呆，某个病？？<br>我们对将达到的作用很兴奋。<br>Mr. Keshe:Oh god help, god help with Alzheimer’s. Those of you who have families and relations with Alzheimer. I’m waring you. You gonna be in a very good ride:<br>上帝会保佑老年痴呆症，如果你家里亲戚有这病，你会有一个很棒的治疗体验<br>They heard everything over the years whatever you told them and you thought they don’t hear.<br>（患病期间）他们其实听了很多年了，即使你认为他们听不见<br>Then they will tell you what you have hidden.<br>他们还能说出你的隐晦<br>Then man will ever be wrong to no one.<br>而且他们一点都不会错..<br>Heather Bryant:<br>So this helps them to come back into their body like … they’ve kind of been out?<br>Heather Bryant:就像他们有某种分离，如此帮助他们回到他们身体里了。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>This count if they want this. Alzheimer is an emotional condition. They don’t want to part of the present existence and you who want to bring them back to remember, but it’s so harsh for them that they don’t want to remember. But you give them enough confidence and energy that everything is going to be fine, they will come out, they will be there.<br>凯史：这得归于他们想要如此，老年痴呆症的人他们不想存在于当下，你想把他们带回来并记起来，刺耳的是他们则不要记忆起来，但是你给他们创造了足够的条件和能量让情况好转，他们将回归，愿意存在。<br>I’ve done many Alzheimer’s. This technology is perfect for this kind of … [Heather begins to speak and overlaps some words]<br>我们治疗了很多老年痴呆，这种技术对此很有效<br>Heather Bryant:<br>And that’s still free will? We are not doing anything against the persons? [some words missing because of overlapping] They would not come in if they wouldn’t choose to heal or balance their disease?<br>仍然免费？我们没有对人没做任何对抗性行为，（因为重音丢失一段），如果他们不进来，他们就不会选择治愈疾病或说平衡<br>Heather Bryant:<br>Mr. Keshe:No. Nothing at all.<br>You will find these plasma units in every corner in the coming time. Thus people who are on the way … You have to realize as I said before in the other teachings that just because you took a plasma you got to be not hungry for the rest of the day. You still need to pay a visit to it or make a contact to it tha<br>凯史：你将来在到处都能找到等离子体单元，这是人们的行为方式，你要明白我在其他教学所说的，你以后的日子不会再挨饿因为你获得了等离子体.你只是仍然需要前往或联系它，<br> you take from it what you need and you give it to him what you don’t need.<br>你拿走你所需留下你多余的。<br>In a way it becomes a super-market with everything in it.<br>这就成为一种应有尽有的超市模式<br>Heather Bryant:Ya, ok these 3 coils, these 3 universal coils that are in there, 3 corners of the rehab center: Are they plugged in to the wall for a while to condition them?<br>Heather Bryant:哈，在康复中心有3个线圈，需要插电去配置它们？？（应该有前文不确定）<br>Mr. Keshe:No. You have … No no, you only use … never plug these into the wall!<br>凯史：不要，不要插电<br>Heather Bryant:Ok they’re just running on that plasma battery-capacitor.<br>Heather Bryant:好，他们运行在等离子体电池上<br>Mr. Keshe:Plasma battery, that’s enough, yeah. You have no attachment to the physicality.<br>凯史：等离子体电池，不要跟肉体接触<br>Make sure:Everything has to be nano-coated, … GANS which you have no matter-state.<br>确保一切都被涂层，甘丝不是物质状态<br>Heather Bryant:So, there just a brushing of the GANS at a quick dip of the GANS?<br>那么，快速在甘丝里浸泡一下？？<br>Mr. Keshe:Yeah, you are highly educated, it’s phantastic, I like your [??? some words overlapping]<br>你受过高等教育，这是幻想，我像你那样？？？（丢失）<br>Heather Bryant:Then make sure you have the three?<br>Haah … oh I love this, this is … I can just see it … going.<br>Heather Bryant:那么你有三个，我爱这个，我能看见？？？<br>Mr. Keshe:No problem.<br>Come back and tech us when you learned. [??? some words overlapping]<br>凯史：没问题，学到什么再来教我们（丢失）<br>Heather Bryant:Yes I really enjoyed being part of the health expansion in any way.<br>Heather Bryant:我享受这种医疗扩展教学<br>Mr. Keshe:You’re welcome.<br>And no one can tell you: “No”. No one can come and say “We send the armed officers to search for the plasma Magrav system in the building”.<br>It is very, very interesting. Very, very interesting.<br>凯史：你客气了，没有人能对你说“no “,没人能对你说，我们来搜查等离子体系统”（意思你可以自由研究，政府害怕被公开被讨论<br>Heather Bryant:[I can try if I could get] over and work with Renan for a little while and get the hang of it and come back<br>Heather Bryant:我可以和Renan 工作一会再回来。<br>Mr. Keshe: No problem! Let us know. Thank you very much.<br>凯史没问题，谢谢<br>Heather Bryant: Thank you.<br>Mr. Keshe:Thank you indeed.</p>
<p>Any other question? … ah Rick? … We have no more questions. … Hallo? …<br>凯史：还有其他问题？<br>Rick:Hi, ahm I had another viewer that came up there, not sure wht the name was. Just someone else in the panellist now that had a question? For Mr. Keshe?<br>来自讨论组一个不知名的老兄有个问题<br>Rick:There are a couple of other questions in the chat here.<br>有一票问题在聊天频道</p>
<p>02:25:05<br>Mary? Mary asks: “Dear Mr. Keshe, what combination of amino-acids are safe to use for Jacky’s system for Food-Energy? Can we include the amino-acid of copper oxide (CuO2)?”<br>Mary 问Jacky的系统用什么样的氨基酸组合是安全的，能考虑氧化铜的氨基酸么？？（看不到前文联系请修正）<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Why not? Because you don’t touch it. If you need it, you take it. What we can use anything with these system as a GANS coating. Because you are made of millions of different fields and you need the combination, [??? to touch it by ???] the totality.<br>凯史：为什么不能，因为你不用接触它，我们能用任何（甘丝）给这个系统做为甘丝包裹，因为人就是由数百万不同场的组合，你需要（各种）组合，（丢失）<br>Rick:  Waldemar asks: “Concerning food, what are the consequences of drinking cow- and/or seeds milk”, so cow milk or seed milk?<br>Rick:Waldemar问，有关食物，饮用牛奶或种奶有何后果？？（不知问的啥，需联系未知的前文理解修正，是否是问从食物机品尝牛奶有何后果？）<br>Mr. Keshe:’s not my problem. I don’t know. You are talking about a field that I don’t … I have no connection with.<br>凯史：这不是我的研究问题，不清楚，你谈论的场我不…没有考虑过<br>Rick:  Right, he’s asking in terms of based on Kf Plasma Technology.<br>Rick:t他在问基于凯史基金等离子体技术术语的（理解）<br>Mr. Keshe:It’s like you eat a cow itself and most probably it’s the same with what you eat, the goat milk.<br>很大可能就像你在吃奶，山羊奶<br>Any other question?<br>其他问题<br>Rick:  Mr. Keshe I’m … Ianus … Iownes … Iones from Greece that asked a question about the emigrants: “Will there be blueprints for the food device? Because I’m new to this concept. It’s hard for me to build this device from this video”<br>Rick:来自希腊的lones 问的移民问题，有食物装置蓝图么，我刚接触这种概念，很难根据视频来构筑这种装置。<br>Mr. Keshe:Yes, … ahm Renan, can we do this very quickly and release it?<br>凯史“Renqn我们能很快释放蓝图么<br>Renan:Yes, Sir, we have ??? designed for this because it’s similar to the spaceship. Yes, I did some.<br>Renan:先生，因为跟太空船的设计相似，我们已设计出了<br>Mr. Keshe:Ok, if we go on the blueprint, we can find it there by tomorrow or the day after? … Renan?<br>Would we be able to find it in the next couple of days?<br>凯史：好，如果我们完成，我们明天或后台就有了<br>Renan:Yes, Sir. The other blueprints as well that we have it’s all ready ready in up in the public cloud. Soon the “Go” signal once they are passed by the quality control just checking for the spellings and typing. It will be put by the development team on the public blueprint page.<br>Renan:s是的，先生，其他的蓝图我们也准备好了在公共云里，他们一旦完成拼写品控就可流放，将放在开发组的公共蓝图页里。<br>Mr. Keshe:Iones from Greece: You do not know what you released with that little text.<br>You have freed the man from the shackles of his life for millions of years. Thank you very much for sending it.<br>应该是凯史说：你们不知道你们在做的是在将人类从数百万年的枷锁中解放出来。<br>It’s [??? maybe two melted words together] No coincidences! While we were doing the test, Carolina just came up with and says “Look what is just come on my chat”. Just as we finished testing. Couple of days ago we were doing it. And it is very interesting, how the emotion, because it is pure reaches where it needs and you get the answer back for it.<br>它…（丢失），不是巧合，当我们测试时，凯洛林过来说“看看我的聊天里有啥”当几天前我们做的测试非常有趣，情感如何，因为它纯粹基于它需要的区域，你从它获取回应（可能需要更多联系翻译，凯史的概念描述需要我们大量宏观的联系理解，需要对他的知识的积淀）<br>We could have kept it off for a few more weeks, but if you are in Germany, if you are in Belgium, if you are in Holland, if you are in Italy and you call them “refugees”, they are not refugees.<br>我们没有关注有几个星期了吧，在德国，比利时，荷兰，意大利你们称呼他们为“难民”。他们不是难民。<br>These are the man-made refugees. Don’t go out and give them ??? or a piece of bread.<br>Make a system and tell them: “You all eat, what you like.”<br>都是人为的难民，不要出去给他们面包，做个（食物）系统给他们“这里有所有你要吃的”<br>“And if you need heat, take what you need. And if there is a pain, just think of the pain and you will receive.”<br>如果你需要热量，就会获得，如果你有痛苦，只要想到痛楚就会被治疗。<br>And then go and ask them the next day “If you are hungry, we do a public testimonial.”<br>然后改天再去问他们“他们是否饿，我们有公共用品给你<br>They’ll all have, what they need. They eat, what they need. We give back the human race the dignity of living.<br>他们会获得他们需要的，我们由此而还给人类生存的尊严。<br>Just try it and let’s see where we are going to go.<br>让我们努力，让我们看我们能走到哪一步<br>Any other question?<br>其他问题<br>Sandy: Hi Mr. Keshe, here is Sandy …<br>Sandy:凯史先生，我是Sandy<br>Mr. Keshe: Hello Misses Westinghouse? I think the company is going bankrupt from tonight, ha?<br>凯史：威斯丁豪斯小姐，我想公司从今晚开始破产了。（外国笑话？）<br>Sandy: Hahahahaha … yes, I agree. You know, the other day Jacky says I help the 3Year class, Jacky was showing the 3Year class his unit and talking to us about it and I remember, as soon as he showed us this unit, I felt this sort of connection. I want to sit in it. And also I had this vision of sitting in this unit and looking at Jacky’s sealing at his desk just kind of waving out of [me ???]<br>Sandy:哈哈，我同意，Jacky在3年制班级上展示他的单元，我记得他展示完我就感到这种联系，我想坐进去，我也坐在单元看到Jacky密封桌子就像某种围绕波形？？（无联系文不知所云）<br>And he was talking about how he gets the walls of these to move in, he was saying basically he just wants it to move and he notices it, the change. And I was claimed with my imagination being his unit, changing the walls and stuff like that. Oh it felt really fun [??? or “fine”]. I felt very energized by being there.<br>他在谈论着怎样让这个的墙面移动？？基本上他是说想让它移动，他注意到了改变，我随着我的对他的单元的想像，改变墙面和设施，感到很开心，我在那有被极大充能的感觉（是她的想象出的体验？大概需联系更多内容修改）</p>
<p>第七部分<br>02:30:44<br>And then today when Jacky came on and was again showing his additional unit now and I was thinking “Wow, you know: I should be able to myself there and without even having a unit feel myself drinking.”<br>今天当杰克过来的时候，再次展示他的单元的附件,现在我想“哇！你知道：我应该能够在外面就感觉到自己从单元里喝到了饮料.<br>Mr. Keshe:   Do you want to get in the unit?<br>凯史先生:你想从单元里取得吗?<br>Sandy: I want to get in it? So I have to make one? I can’t use Jacky’s?<br>桑迪:我想从它那里取得?所以我应该去制造一个?我不能用杰克的吗?<br>Mr. Keshe:   You can make one or if you want to use Jacky’s, come to Dubai. It’ll be brought here to Dubai to be shown.<br>凯史先生:你可以自己造一个或者如果你用杰克的,来迪拜,把它带到迪拜来展示.<br>Sandy: [laughing slightly] I have to come there …<br>Well I mean I’m enjoying Jacky’s right now to be true, ok … [she laughs heartily]</p>
<p>桑迪:{笑声}我会去那儿…<br>Mr. Keshe:   Jacky! You’ll becoming a very popular man.<br>凯史先生:杰克!你将成为一个非常受欢迎的人.<br>Sandy:Yes, he is.<br>桑迪:是的,他是的.<br>Mr. Keshe: You are feeding the world.<br>凯史先生:你在供养宇宙<br>Sandy:So, I’m thinking: Maybe I don’T bother building a unit or should I still bother building one to pass out? … I guess I should do that.<br>It’s this about just enjoying Jacky’s by myself.<br>Or I can just hold other people when the unit with me, can’t I?<br>I can take people when the unit with her, with me?<br>桑迪:所以,我在想:也许我得建造一个单元或者我更应该建造一个单元并把它传递出去?<br>Mr. Keshe:   Yeah, why not?<br>凯史先生:是的,为什么不呢?<br>Sandy: Yeah, why not? I like that idea. Ok so I can it be answered my own question, I all just take everyone with me into the unit.<br>桑迪:是的,为什么不呢?我喜欢那个主意.好了,我可以回答我自己的问题了.我只是带每个人与我进入单元.<br>Mr. Keshe:Ok, no problem. But what we are going to do: We will are going to put this regularly on the net or we come back.<br>That if you don’t have a unit: Try to see if you can tune. We’ll leave more or less some times Jacky can organize it with Vince that certain hours we put the camera open on the system, that you all can come and eat together.<br>Across the world. We make it a GANS Food Channel or the Link. Let people come and eat.<br>凯史先生:好的,没问题.但是我们要做什么:我们会定期把这个放到网上或者我们回来的时候.<br>那么如果你没有一个单元:看看你是否能够调整.我们会留下一些时间,杰克和文斯可以在某些时间里组织这个我们在系统上把摄像机打开,然后你们所有人来都可以同时获得饮食.<br>整个世界,我们开设一个甘斯食物频道或者链接.让人们来吃.<br>Can we do that, Vince?<br>You know we used to run the life camera on the experiments in Sensano? Can we do this with this unit that people can come and eat when they like, when the restaurant is open til they get used to it? And see if we get a feedback remote?<br>Is Vince about? … He is looking for his silence button. … Hello … [singing] Vince, are you there?<br>Or he’s gone for a coffee to burn his tongue.<br>我们可以做到.文斯?<br>你知道我们在Sensano对像机寿命的试验吗?我们可以用这个单元装置做到让那些人来吃食物,当他们喜欢的时候.当这个餐馆开张时他们会习惯吗?看看我们是否可以得到远程的反馈?<br>文斯关于?….他好像按下了静音按钮…喂…[哼歌]文斯在吗?文斯,还在那里吗?<br>噢,他走了因为咖啡烫了他的舌头.<br>Vince: I’ve got a kid here with me. Sorry, can you repeat that?<br>文斯:有一个孩子和我在一起.抱歉,你可以重新说下吗?<br>Mr. Keshe:   Yeah, I said: Can we put a link that everyday at a given time that people can go that they can put a camera on this unit that people around the world can come and test to eat.<br>Put it through food or what you call it plasma-food-system or whatever you call it dot keshefoundation dot org<br>And let people come and eat. Bring wide world to eat what they come and eat. The Chinese eat their … what you call it Noodles, the Japanese will come for the Sushi, in Middle East they come for the Kebab and the Americans go for their steaks and the other ones who like kangaroos will have the kangaroos. Can we open a food dot keshefoundation dot org?<br>Jacky can you do that with Vince?<br>凯史先生:是的,我刚才说:我们可以建立一个链接,每天在固定的一个时间段,人们可以把摄像机放在这个装置上,那么全世界的人都可以来吃东西.<br>通过给他们食物或者你们所谓的”等离子体食物装置”或者诸如此类,你们叫它”dot keshefoundation dot org<br>然后请人们来吃饭.在广阔的世界范围内请他们来吃饭.中国人吃他们的…你叫它什么?面条.日本人在这里吃到寿司,中东人吃到烤肉,美国人吃到牛排以及其他人喜欢袋鼠就有袋鼠.我们可以开放一个food dot keshefoundation dot org?<br>杰克,你可以和文斯来做这件事情吗?<br>Vince: We can set something up and then announce it on Thursday, I think we can set something up.<br>Jacky Yes sure, no problem.<br>文斯:我们可以把这个建立起来然后再星期四发布出来,我想我们可以建立起来.<br>杰克:是的,确定,没问题.<br>Mr. Keshe:So we start to see if we can feed the people around the world. And maybe we put a screen on the Times Square on the screen on the top, people just go and look at the picture and get fed, they don’t need to go hungry.<br>凯史先生:所以我们开始看见如果我们可以喂养全世界的人们.也许我们在时代广场顶上放一个大屏幕在屏幕上方,人们仅仅看一眼这些图片就可获得营养,他们再也不需要回到饥饿的时代.<br>This is the expansion of the knowledge. It’s an expansion of understanding the knowledge. This is understanding the totality of the whole process. We have not come with these systems suddenly “This is what’s going to do”. We have built to this point. There is as lot more to learn.<br>这是这个知识的扩展.它是在理解这个知识之后的扩展.这是理解全部的来龙去脉.我们不是突然地,莫名其妙的就有了这些装置.”这是怎么回事”.我们已经来到建造这个的节点上,这里有更多的知识要学习.<br>Because once in the coming time, you start building systems and you start finding … you say “I lost my appetite!”. You haven’t lost your appetite because now you take energy what you need from the environment. So, there shall be no hunger.<br>因为一旦在未来的时间,你开始建造你的系统你会发现…你说”我没有食欲了!”.你没有失去你的食欲因为现在你从环境里面摄取你需要的能量.所以,那个地方没有饥饿.<br>02:35:00<br>And the beauty with this is as you’ve seen with the other systems with the health systems when you have a disease, when you feed the emotion, the physicality will not suffer, too and changes.<br>So, we will see man become “Man of Peace”.<br>Because we interrupt the emotion inside our brain to force it to accept our inhuman behavior of eating others to feed ourselves.<br>Where the emotion could have accepted it from its environment. Just all you needed to be a ??? everywhere to get what it needs, a spectrum of it.<br>然后,这是很美妙的,如同你看到的其他系统比如当你生病的时候你使用的健康系统.当你喂养你的情感,你的肉体就不会遭受痛苦.并且发生转变.<br>因此,我们将看到人类成为”和平的人类”<br>因为我们的终止了我们头脑中被强制接受的这个情感,它导致我们残忍的行为:把其他生命当作食物来供养我们自己.<br>在那里情感本来可以接受它从环境中汲取能量.只是你们所有人的被塑造成???在所有地方满足任何需求.被不断地强调.<br>00:35:36<br>If you back to the original teachings, I always said:<br>The physical part is a leach on top of the emotion. And now you can free yourself from all the pains you have caused by eating the other things which you thought is your right.<br>如果回到以前的教学,我总是说:<br>物理的部分是一个在情感上的过滤器.现在你可以自由地从所有的痛苦中解脱,这归因于你吃的其他东西,你认为你是对的.<br>This has one reason why you’re going through this process, that is:<br>When you start using the fields of the universe then you don’t eat. It goes out of your ethos of eating other things and in the space you survive.<br>这里有一个原因为什么你会开始这个进程,这就是:<br>当你开始使用宇宙中的场体,那么你不能去吃,熄灭你把其他东西当做食物的想法那么你在太空中才可以幸存下来。<br>At the moment you share food what I call energy through these systems with the Chinese, with the Japanese, with the Iranians, with the Arabs, with the Turks, with the Italians, with the French, with the Americans, with the Spanish, with Mexicans and the rest.<br>Once you completed this process to become detached you will share the same system with the man from deep space. Does not matter, where he comes from.<br>此刻你通过这些系统分享我所称的能量食物给中国人，日本人，伊朗人，阿拉伯人，土耳其人，意大利人，法国人，美国人，西班牙人，墨西哥人以及等等其他人。<br>当你完整地走过这个进程你将成为在外太空同样也会分享这些系统的人。没关系他就是来自于哪里。<br>This is the beginning of the ch ange and the start of a new style of living without taking life.<br>Then you find out: Anywhere in the universe is open to the man.<br>I have taken man from the wildest animal to the tamest thing in the universe if the man realizes the gift given.<br>[ … some seconds blackout … ]<br>It takes you 6 months to go through the process.<br>We can hear Jacky: Within 3 days, they had the feeling.<br>You have to change every time different elements, different food and then you’ll find out:<br>Your body builds up!<br>这是巨大的变革并开始新的没有杀戮的生活方式。<br>你会发现：宇宙的任何地方都是对人类开放的。<br>我已经把人类在宇宙中从狂热的动物变成驯服的人类，如果人类意识到给予是恩赐的天赋。<br>【……短暂的掉线……】<br>它给你6个月的时间来通过这个进程。<br>我们可以听到杰克：3天之内，他们有这样的感觉。<br>你必须每时每刻去改变不同的元素，不同的食物那么你会发现：<br>你的体格在好转！。<br>Build a system, go in the center of it and then get everybody else to go.<br>A lot of you should have received information when Liza told us that the Chinese when they are testing the Magrav systems, they call it “The Happy Room”.<br>Now you understand why!<br>Because it gives the satisfaction. Lot of people have told us over and over when they are working with these systems, they are not hungry that much any more. When you built a system in the shape we have done and you become the 4th one you receive all combination of the energies you like, you need without you eating and harming another animal.<br>Those who really talk about the peace, World Peace: Come and try.<br>建造一个系统，去到它的中心然后让其他每个人都去。<br>许多你应该接受的信息当丽萨告诉我们当中国人测试能量单元的时候，他们叫它“幸福房间”<br>现在你明白为什么了吧！<br>因为它给予满足，很多人曾告再三诉我们当他们在与这些系统工作的时候，他们没有任何饥饿感。当你在模型中建造一个系统我们已经完成你成为第四代的人，你接受所有的这些组合你看起来充满活力。<br>你不再有吃其他动物的需要。<br>这是在谈论真正的和平。世界和平，来尝试这样做。<br>There is something I have to explain to you:<br>Those of you scientists who’ve written to us and asked for clarification: We put <a href="mailto:security@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@keshefoundation.org</a><br>You’ve been writing to us: “It does not exist”. I made a mistake last time, I called it security.keshefoundation.org. It’s <a href="mailto:security@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@keshefoundation.org</a>. You’ll be responded if your life is in danger or you’ve been threatened or you have problems.<br>We go in deeper section on Thursday. On Thursday we are going to unravel a lot of things what is happening around the internet and the people who appeared the same what I call “Tom and Jerry Act”. We’ve seen it with others, we come into it, because today is not the time for it. But if you are interested, join us on Thursday.</p>
<p>At the same time tomorrow night we give an interview to Kerry Cassidy on the panel of “Energy”. Mike Harris is with me. We are going to open a lot of things about “Free Energy”.<br>And as you know, Kerry Cassidy needs a lot of support. She’s doing a lot of good work. She was dispositioned by others now they had their … been having what we call “cool drink” being the guest of the government in the special houses. Now Kerry Cassidy needs a support that we keep the flagship of discussion to be fair and opened open. We support Kerry Cassidy in every shape of form. She needs huge amount of support to keep the doors open to be impartial.<br>这里有些事情需要向你们解释：<br>你们有些科学家给我们写的要求澄清的信件：我们把它放到<br><a href="mailto:security@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@keshefoundation.org</a><br>你曾经写信给我们：“它是不存在的”，上次我犯了一个错误，我把它叫做安全点凯史基金会点Org.[ <a href="mailto:security@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@keshefoundation.org</a>]<br>它是<a href="mailto:security@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@keshefoundation.org</a><br>你可以回信到这里如果你的生命遇到危险或者受到威胁或者其他问题。<br>在周四我们将更深入，在周四我们将阐明更多那些围绕着互联网发生的事情以及某些人发表的如同我称之为“汤姆和杰瑞的戏剧”。我们与其他人都明白，我们进入它，因为今天不是要谈论这个的时候。但是如果你很感兴趣，加入我们周二的教学。<br>在明天晚上的某个时间，我们给了凯瑞。卡西迪的采访节目“能源”。麦克。哈里斯和我。我们将揭露更多所谓的“免费能源”的事情。<br>然后你知道，凯瑞。卡西迪需要更多的报道。她做了很多有益的工作。她被认为是有某种特质的，现在他们有他们的……具有我们所谓的“冷饮料”特质，是被政府特邀的，在专门准备的房间里。现在凯瑞。卡西迪需要支持，我们要保持良好的状态来讨论火爆的和开放的话题。我们在各个方面支持凯瑞。卡西迪。她需要巨大无限的支持来以保持公正和透明。<br>Thank you very much for today. And think of one thing: 9th of March is the day when the human race changes its habit. New food is on the table: Energy of the Universe.<br>Thank you very much for today.<br>今天非常感谢你们。我想有件事情：三月九号是人类习性转变的节日。新的食物已经端上桌面：宇宙的能量。<br>非常感谢今天。<br>Rick: Thank you Mr. Keshe, thank you very much.<br>瑞克：谢谢凯史先生，非常感谢你。<br>Vivek: Thank you, Mr. Keshe.<br>维维克：谢谢你凯史先生。<br>Someone else: Thank you, Mr. Keshe.<br>其他人：谢谢你凯史先生。<br>Someone else: Thank you, Mr. Keshe, thank you Rick, everybody.<br>其他人：谢谢凯史先生，谢谢瑞克和所有人。</p>
<p>Rick: Ok I think we are in the video with the “Free Energy in Exchange for World Peace” video.<br>瑞克：好咯，我想我们要播放视频“自由能源与世界和平的变革”<br>Someone else:    Merci beaucoup, Jacky.<br>其他人：【法语】谢谢你，杰克。<br>Jacky: Thank you Arent???, thank you.<br>杰克：谢谢你Arent???,谢谢。<br>Mr. Keshe: Gentlemen please remember: We meet as usual time tonight to have dinner.<br>凯史先生：先生们请记住：我们在今天晚饭后再见。<br>Rick: [laughs heartily]<br>瑞克：【笑】<br>Jacky:       Ok, we will be there.<br>杰克：好的，我们到时见。<br>Mr. Keshe:   Usual time we’ll meet you.<br>凯史先生：通常的时间再见。<br>Rick’s child shouting:  Thank you for [??? measua ???]<br>瑞克的孩子大叫：谢谢你【？？？弥赛亚？？？】<br>Mr. Keshe:   Thank you, darling! The voice of the children of the world! … Bye!<br>She’s gorgeous. Thank you. Thank you indeed, bye bye.<br>凯史先生：谢谢你，亲爱的。孩子的声音世界的声音……再见！<br>她那么灿烂，谢谢你，再次感谢。再见。<br>Good night to everyone. We’ll see us on Thursday.<br>晚安所有人！我们星期四见。</p>
