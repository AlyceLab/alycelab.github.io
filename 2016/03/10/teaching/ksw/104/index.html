<h3 id="Beginning-of-the-video"><a href="#Beginning-of-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Beginning of the video"></a>Beginning of the video</h3><p>（宣传）视频开始<br>“You are people listening from every corner of this planet …<br>“这个星球各个角落的听众都在收听我们的教学。<br>No knowledge has been disbursed so beautifully, so balanced, across the planet, on this planet ever … maybe in the Universe!<br>知识从来没有像现在这样在这个星球、在宇宙中如此美妙、如此平衡地传播！<br>You have the full potential of achieving everything in the Universe. There is no need, and there is no reason for Man not to achieve. So, wherever you are, the way I taught you to make the coils, the double coil inside, you have continuous equal gravitational-magnetic fields, and if you put Co2 on it, and you put Zinc on it, you have connected the emotion of the Man through it, in a stable condition. And you will find out, you become a very peaceful Man.<br>你拥有在这个宇宙中实现任何事物的全部能力。没有必要也没有理由说人类无法实现。 通过我教给你们制造套在里面的双线圈，你拥有了持续的平衡的斥引力场。 如果你把CO2、锌放在（线圈）上面， 你通过它就能连接到人类的情感，在稳定的条件下你将发现你会变成一个非常和平的人。<br>Here, instead of having galaxies and universes, and creating connection magnetically, we have used the matter-state gravitational-magnetic field strength, to dominate and dictate the shape of the Plasma. The nano-technology, the nano-materials which you have collectively developed in different ways, by caustic, by electric currents, by whatever, fire or whatever, has that advantage, that the Matter, the Nano, and the Plasma is all the same. So, connection is very solid, it’s very strong.<br>在这里，我们用物质状态的引力-斥力场的强度去描述星系和宇宙，用引力去创建连接，去支配和控制等离子体的形状。这些纳米技术、纳米材料在不同的地区通过不同的方式获得， 通过诸如烧碱、电流、火烧等任何方便或麻烦的方式，纳材料和等离子体（的属性）仍然维持不变。因此这个联接是非常牢固非常强大的。<br>The power of the Plasma technology the way we have thought, is beyond imagination of the man. Now, you can create and control the Plasma, which is the Mother of the Creation of the Universe. We are given the seed of the Essence of the Creation.<br>The Foundation does not belong to no one, and is not made of one anymore. You are developing it, you are structuring it, and from today, we’ll still be the same. We’ll still develop the technology, in different names, in different colours, in different nationalities (which they do not exist). It is beautiful when we see, the Christian, the Muslims, the Jews, and every other belief, are working together to build up systems. We have already become one faith. We already have become one nation, and we already have become one planet.<br>我们认为这样的等离子体技术的能量的方式，是超过人类的想象的。现在，你可以制造和控制等离子体了。等离子体是宇宙造物的源头。我们已给了你们非常重要的造物的种子。凯史基金会不属于任何人，也不是由一个组成了，你们发展、构建她。以后都这样一直通过不同的名字、不同的肤色、在不同的国家（以后它不存在）来发展这项技术。当我们看见基督徒们、 穆斯林们、犹太人和其他不同信仰的人在一起共同建造这个系统，是非常美妙的。我们早已变成共同的信仰，我们已经成为一个种族、一个星球。<br>You’ve got to remember one thing… “Dates” is irrelevant. Today is the last day of the Christian calendar, or tomorrow is the beginning of another… One date is connected to another. We don’t stop. We are working around the clock. The Keshe Foundation team is working irrespective of time, position, religion, country.<br>你们必须记住一件事情：“日期”是无关的。今天是基督教历法的最后一天，明天会是新的开始，一天接着一天，我们不会停下来，我们会日以继夜地工作，凯史基金会团队的工作不分时间、地域、宗教、国家。<br>And now, we achieve what we set out for !”<br>现在我们正在为实现目标而前进！”<br>(Mehran T. Keshe to the Nations of the World, transcribed by Pawel)<br>(迈赫兰.T.凯史致世界各国    帕韦尔记录）</p>
<p>00:05:55<br>Rick:Welcome everyone to the 104th Keshe Knowledge Seekers Workshop step marks the 52*2 which is 2 years worth of Knowledge Seekers Workshops with Mr. Keshe the Keshefoundation Spaceship Institute and we are happy to have been part of that for the last couple of years. And helping to get the original workshops going with Mr. Keshe who suggested it from the Plasma Reactor Group that I had.<br>瑞克：欢迎各位来到104次凯史太空学院知识寻求者教学节目，104标志这个知识教学已经有两年了，这是凯史先生与凯史基金会太空学院组织的教学，我们很高兴看等离子反应堆的技术已经在过去几年里有所促进。<br>Where we had people coming in and showing their various reactors and experiments.<br>任何人可以来这里展示他们的各种各样的反应器和实验，<br>So, … Mr. Keshe, … are you ready to go with today’s workshop I understand you have to lots of dynamite topics to bring up today.<br>凯史先生，您准备好开始今天的教学了吗？我知道您今天有大量的重要的教学主题提出。<br>00:06:55<br>Yes, good morning, good day to you as usual wherever and whenever you listen to these Knowledge Seeker programs.<br>凯史：是的。早上好，日间好，像往常一样无论你在哪里，无论什么时间聆听这次知识寻求者教学。<br>As Rick said, this started as a small participating in his program some 108 programs before and then, when I was there, we suggested to do a separate thing totally and this the 104th program, two years. Summer, winter, Christmas, new year … we’ve been there, we never stop going and in that way we have shared a lot of knowledge.<br>正如瑞克所说，在开始108次教学之前有一些小的程序？在这次教学里，然后，当我在这里，我们建议把104次教学作为一个独立的系统。两年……夏天，冬天，圣诞，新年……。我们在这里，我们从来没有停止以这种方式去分享更多的知识。<br>We have brought a lot of comfort to a lot of people and at the same time a lot of people have started a new way of thinking and adding to the science of man.<br>我们给很多人带来了很大的安慰，并在同一时间有很多人已经开始思考增加人类科学的一个新途径。<br>I think in so many ways the combination of moving out of Belgium where we were in casurated and coming in contact and coming across a man like Rick in his thoughts has been a combination of the success of the Kf spreading so rapidly even though we were in public, we were known but the teachings have brought the knowledge across the world in a very, very simple way.<br>我想在我们从比利时迁出之后在很多方面有新的接触和组合，并无意中发现像瑞克这样的一个想法使凯史基金会发展如此之快，我们公开的组合方式取得巨大的成功，我们知道，通过一个非常，非常简单方式，教学使得知识在世界各地迅速地传播。<br>We have achieved a lot.<br>我们已经取得很多成果。<br>And in so many ways now that we have achieved a lot, we sharing and other people around the world knowing and unknowing, we will we benefit abide.<br>在很多方面我们已经取得了成果，我们分享（等离子技术？）给世界上其他知道或不知道的的人，让人们受益。<br>This week, we have signed in 5 new companies, all in United States.<br>这周，我们在美国注册了五个新的公司。<br>4 have been signed in  … one is to … it’s been  signed, it just needs a adjustment on positioning or a rest, the 5 companies have come into birth.<br>四个已经完成注册，一个正在……它已经注册完成，它仅需要一些调整或者一些时间，这五家公司已经诞生。<br>5 companies in United States will support the American Nation in reducing the pollution in increasing the use of clean energy reducing their pains and the rest which will come and is coming by the new technology.<br>在美国的这五家公司将通过我们的新技术给美国带去新的清洁能源使得环境污染减少，减少病痛。<br>Now we have a company in Germany, in Italy … soon we will have a company which is signed in in China and the rest will be signed in when we are in there. And all together now there is signed into Kf about 9 factories across the world.<br>现在我们在德国也有新的公司，在意大利……很快我们希望在中国也注册公司或者在其他地区，我们坚持不懈地进行这些工作。<br>By the end of the year will become round about 30, 32 as I see it.<br>到年底我们大约有30,32家公司，我想是这样。<br>Maybe more. This is all on the back of you sharing the knowledge, you testing it, you bringing it more understanding and we just putting it on the platform to share with the others.<br>或许更多。这是建立在所有你们分享知识的基础之上的，你们测试它，你们带来更多的理解，我们只是给你们建立一个分享的平台。<br>I add to the knowledge and you build on it.<br>我带来知识，你们建设它。<br>And then you add to the knowledge, we build on it.<br>然后你加入知识，我们共同建设它。<br>And it’s become a very good collaboration as I said this morning in my interview with Kerry Cassidy in the what they call the open panel discussion.<br>然后它变成是非常美好的合作，正如我今天早上与凯瑞。卡西迪在开放专题讨论会上所说的。<br>Keshefoundation Forum as we see it, the Knowledge Seekers as we do it on Tuesdays and Thursdays has become an open platform for most of the people out of the new generation of scientists.<br>我们明白凯史基金会论坛，我们使这个周二和周四知识寻求者教学成为一个对大多数人开放式的平台以培养新的（等离子技术方面）科学家。<br>Housewifes, … scientists, … different organizations who been looking for alternative way to do things that it could make sense.<br>家庭主妇、科学家、不同组织方式，这是我们一直寻找的新的做事方式，这是有意义的。<br> “Free Energy”, “False Hope”, “Sousan”, “Red Circle” and the Mess<br>“自由能源”、“假希望”、“苏桑”、“红圈”和混乱<br>This morning session, as I explained to Carry, was a lot of talk about the “Free Energy”.<br>今天上午的会议上，我向卡瑞解释，当时谈论了很多关于“自由能源”。<br>“Free energy” became the word built up by one man and it was good for him because that word brought him a lot of children.<br>“自由能源”成为一个人建立起来的词，因为这个词给他带来了很多的（利益？）孩子这是为他好。<br>Now we’ve seen he’s behind prison and is well in custody<br>现在我们看见他被监禁，舒服地住在拘留所里。<br>Now we come to the fact that there is no Free … it’s an alternative.<br>现在我们知道的真相，没有免费的…这是一个替代的选择。<br>We all as team of scientists around the world in different names of shapes of form are introducing different way of alternative using the energy.<br>   我们为世界各地的不同名称的科学家小组介绍使用各种替代能源的方式。<br>Be it in medicine, be it in agriculture, be it in power supply, be it in manufacturing of new materials, being in the space.<br>在医疗方面，农业方面，在能源供应方面，在新材料制造方面，在太空技术方面<br>So please understand the term “Free Energy”<br>所以，请理解术语：“自由能源”<br>is for those who were abusers.<br>是被滥用的。<br>They wanted to abuse and they abuse came because they got free children out of it.<br>他们想要维持虐待和滥用的权利，因为获得自由的孩子们将不受控制。<br>In so many ways it’s a new horizon.<br>在很多方面，这是一个新的前景。<br>It’s a new way as I said.<br>这是新的途径，就像我所说的。<br>If nuclear is free , if oil is free then plasma technology is a free energy, too.<br>如果核能是免费的，如果石油是免费的那么等离子体技术也是一种免费的能源。<br>We are a new way of energy which we knew but we didn’t know how （to） tap into it.<br>我们知道这是一个新的能源, 但我们不知道如何利用它。<br>The CERN, the JET-Project, the Russian Tokamak, these are all front runners of what we call the plasma technology which we added to.<br>欧洲核子研究中心的JET（航空动力？）项目，俄罗斯的托卡马克装置（一种受控热核反应装置），他们都是应用了前面我们所说的等离子体技术而成为一路领先的。<br>So we are accumulation of the knowledge of the man over years.<br>所以，我们是积累知识多年的人。<br>None of us, nobody can say: “I’ve done this, I brought this out.”<br>没有人，没有任何人可以说“我做了这个（技术？），我带来这个（技术？）”。<br>I brought my way of thinking about the plasma.<br>我带来关于等离子体的我的思维方式。<br>You bring yours and collectively we add to the knowledge of the man and this is the beauty the way we gone.<br>你以及你们全体共同来丰富这个知识，这是我们美妙的运作方式。<br>With this process in past two years, we have seen how we have literally demolished the patent business.<br>在过去的两年中，我们已经看到我们是如何一点点地拆毁这些专利技术。<br>The patent is the right of the man to use it when they need it.<br>专利是正确的当人们需要它的时候。<br>And we have seen how in so many ways it has helped a lot of other people to tune into this because the biggest problem with the patent, controlling it, is the biggest nightmare of every inventor and that is: 7 billion human beings on this planet.<br>在很多方面,我们看到它帮助了很多其他的人，但是专利的最大问题是想要控制。当这个星球上70亿人都是发明家的时候，这是专利制度最大的噩梦。<br>And only maybe 100.000, 20.000, 10.000 maybe a few 100 can replicate the technology.<br>也许只有10万，2万，2千人也许更少的100人能够复制这个技术。<br>The rest even though open is done by the others because they don’t know how to do it.<br>即使这些（技术）是开放的，因为他们不知道如何去做。<br>The fear of patent was created for those who wanted to control.<br>专利是为了那些害怕失去控制的人设置的。<br>Now we’ve seen a new way of patent.<br>现在我们已经看到了应用专利的新方法。<br>What they call the structure of the Wiki’s.<br>他们所谓的维基解密事件.<br>The wickedness. Now they control. The same thing in different way<br>这些是不道德的。由于他们的控制。同样的事情不同的方式。<br>We saw the first Wiki going down.<br>我们首次看见维基解密事件导致他们走向衰亡。<br>And we found out how.<br>以及我们已经找到如何（让他们走向衰亡）的方法。<br>00:13:27<br>I thank you for being there for sharing the knowledge and for teaching us.<br>我感谢你在这里分享这些技术以及教导我们。<br>Every day we learn something new.<br>每天我们都学到一些新的知识。<br>All of us.<br>我们所有人。<br>But the beauty with this technology is:<br>但是，这个技术的美妙之处在于：<br>It’s not just the energy. It’s every aspect of mans life in the space.<br>它不仅是关于能源的。它适用于我们生活的各个方面。<br>So we all have something to add somewhere. We all have a expertise in bringing something to add. It’s not for （??） energy people, is not for the people who are in the health.<br>因此我们可以在任何方面增加这个知识。我们都在各个领域的专业中增加这些知识。它不仅仅是为了人们在能源或者健康方面的运用。<br>Is the one is agriculture … and material, … psychological … children what you call it application of the technology for learning.<br>是农业学……和材料学……心理学……在所有学科的技术方面去学习。<br>Everything is in there, so we are all become part of the family teaching different children of the family being a child being a professor in physics or a child of the foundation being a doctor in a hospital or a child of the foundation , be it a normal man on the street which can help himself.<br>每件事情在这里，我们成为这个大家庭的一部分，教学不同的孩子，或成为在这个家庭里学习的孩子，或者物理学教师或者基金会医院的医生或者基金会的孩子，使人们成为可以自己帮助自己的人。<br>We are all children of the knowledge.<br>我们都是这个知识的孩子。<br>And we are there to learn.<br>我们在这里学习。<br>And we all are part of this structure the Keshefoundation Knowledge Seekers Program is listened by world leaders.<br>我们都是凯史基金会知识寻求者系统结构的一部分，由世界的领导者聆听。<br>00:14:38<br>When we said it … a lot of people say: “He makes a lot of claims”.<br>当我们说……有些人人说：“他作了很多主张”。<br>We have seen it. In response of the president’s into our actions.<br>我们需要明白，总统看到我们行为的反应。<br>And we have seen how the help of the Keshefoundation has managed to get rid of a lot of people who are creating destruction and destruction for their own benefit.<br>我们已经看到了在Keshe基金会的帮助下如何设法摆脱那些人为了自己的利益创造的破坏和毁灭。<br>This term of “Free Energy” was created by one man.<br>“免费能源”是由一个人创建的。<br>The name was correctly chosen for him.<br>这个名字对他是得体的。<br>And we saw his song. It was only to capture children.<br>Nothing else!<br>我们看到他的歌。这只是（为了）捕捉孩子。没有其它！<br>00:15:10<br>The technologies and the new knowledges are new people on the term of knowing it they become what they call comotators??? because he put on because it brings the youth it brings the young and then they pray on it.<br>这些技术和这些知识是新人类的术语他们称为comotators???因为它带着青春的气息，他们祈祷。<br>The structure that we saw how the double act played … and nobody was looking at it … was the capture of the gentleman in Utah now he’s claiming apparently is coming up to 300 children have been abused by him.<br>我们看到他如何扮演双簧戏……没有人看到这一点……那个诱拐儿童的绅士住在犹他州，很明显，至少有300名儿童被他虐待。<br>Every time he saw an opportunity he cleared the child for his abuse and he was given a gift by the judge to do. He’s wrote to somebody in that area: “I’m coming to see your invention”, where the actual target was a child he was targeting to go to abuse.<br>他看到有机会通过贿赂法官而逃脱虐待儿童的罪名。他写给某人的信中说：“我来看你的发明”，实际的情况是，当有一个儿童时，他就实施虐待。<br>Now the pattern work is coming up.<br>现在表演他们的工作模式。<br>00:16:02<br>And they had … there is a say:<br>他们有……这是一段对话：<br>Ask a rat: “Did you eat the cheese?”<br>问老鼠：“你偷吃了奶酪吗”<br>It says “No!”<br>它说：“没有！”<br>He says “are you sure?”<br>他说：“你确定？”<br>It says “My tail is my witness.”<br>它说：“我以我的尾巴作证。”<br>So, we saw the rat in Utah and we saw the tail in Antwerp.<br>我们看见这只老鼠住在犹他州或者在（比利时）安特卫普的房子里。<br>Now that they are both … one is in prison and the other one is running because now it’s filed for him because of his own claim that he actually pissed in the garden in front of a child.<br>现在他们都是……一个在狱中另一个在逃因为他在他的花园里申明了他的主张，他真的很生孩子们的气。<br>It’s a criminal offense the file is …the criminal court is taking action in how many other children has seen this gentleman pissing.<br>这是一个审问罪犯的文件……刑事法庭上的，多少其他的孩子看到这位先生撒尿。<br>But now we got these two on the run and the gentleman who was supporting them now we’ve seen another double act come on.<br>但是现在我们知道这两个逃跑的绅士是谁在支持他们，现在我们看见另外一出双簧戏正在上演。<br>Now two ladies.<br>现在两位女士。<br>A “False Hope” and a “Sousan”.<br>一个是“假希望”和一个“苏珊”<br>Remark from the transcribers:<br>她们的言行看这个连接：</p>

<p>“Sousan” enforces a needle the one which pokes you.<br>“苏珊”那个强烈针对你的。<br>And what is happened these two are doing its the same act if you look<br>2 ladies who have no clue about the world of energy now they call the Keshefoundation with all the structure of you doing and the factories a scam.<br>你们看见这两位女士在做同样的事情，她们声称基金会和基金会工厂是骗局。<br>00:17:02<br>If you look, this was exactly the same.<br>如出一辙。<br>The false bird in Utah and his tail in Antwerp:<br>在犹他州的假鸟和他在安特卫普的尾巴：<br>Now we saw how the “Sousan”, we call it, turned up in the office of the Keshefoundation, she’s got no clue with a beautifully … I got a psychological doc.</p>
<p>现在我们来看看这个“苏珊”的表演，我们这样称呼它，它出现在凯史基金会办公室，她得到了漂亮的线索……我得到了一份心理学文件。<br>And then if you go to the “False Hope” （says about Sousan）:<br>于是，“如果你去“‘虚假的希望’”{苏珊说道}：<br>“She’s helping the African children with her psychological pattern.”<br>她用她的心理模式帮助非洲儿童<br>You see the connection?<br>你看到这中间的联系了吗？<br>00:17:34<br>And the interesting is: The gentleman in Utah was the supporter of the false hopes which has given to the people.<br>这里有趣的是：在犹他州的这位绅士已经给予支持者们虚假的希望。<br>And now they are putting websites everywhere.<br>现在他们在网上随处可见。<br>People who have no clue about energy suddenly are supported because now they are on the run.<br>不关心能源的人突然支持，因为他们现在正在逃。<br>I told you last few weeks ago: These people start doing a lot of damage.<br>They knew （that） the man in Utah is about to be captured, so they set up a new double act of pedophiles.<br>我告诉你最后几周前：这些人开始更大量的伤害。<br>他们知道,这个人在犹他州即将被捕获，所以他们为这个恋童癖演出了一台新的双簧戏。<br>We have communication here, that the “Sousan” asking one of （the） Keshefoundation supporters: “Can I have a picture of your daughter?”<br>我们这里有通讯记录：“我可以要一张你女儿的照片吗？”<br>Talking to them two or three times on the line.<br>与他们两到三次的在线交谈记录。<br>I want to open a panel. Any of you who are decent:<br>我想打开一个面板。看看你们做的体面的事：<br>Do you you ask for the picture of a child?<br>你问一个孩子的照片吗？<br>Just because you spoke somebody on the line?<br>还是仅仅因为与某人的在线通话？<br>When we told you … they sit … Dirk, … äh sorry, Eric, can you put that communication up?<br>当我们告诉你……他们坐下来……匕首……哈抱歉，艾瑞克，你能把那个件信拿出来吗？<br>That where “Sousan” asked for the picture of the child, of your daughter?<br>在这里“苏珊”要求一个孩子的照片，是你女儿吗？<br>Be careful with this woman. She is highly dangerous!<br>小心这个女人。她是极度危险的人！<br>And she is well connected with the pedophiles. We have evidence.<br>她与那个恋童癖关系很好。我们有证据。<br>FBI and CIA are well into the situation.<br>美国联邦调查局和中央情报局都早已进入调查<br>You don’t ask for the picture of a child on the internet unless you have a thing to do.<br>你不必在互联网上要一个孩子的照片除非你有什么目的。<br>And “Sousan” is asking for it to see where they can poke.<br>而“苏珊”自讨苦吃，她在试探，他们在下同样的赌注。<br>We told you （that） they are attacking children.<br>我们告诉你，他们以孩子为攻击目标。<br>Be careful with these people!<br>小心这些人！<br>Secondly the “False Hope”.<br>其次关于“假希望”<br>Now we have documentation from the CIA, … and where is coming in:<br>现在我们有来自CIA的证明文件，……这即将到来；<br>“We are funding psychological behavior of the children in orphanage in Africa”<br>“我们资助在非洲的孤儿院的那些儿童的心理行为”<br>CIA tells us: The kingdom of Morocco has got into it.<br>CIA告诉我们：摩洛哥王国已经陷入其中。<br>And they’ve given us a very nice peace of information the past week:<br>上周他们已经给了我们一个非常好的信息：<br>Children are handed over to orphanage without birth certificate, without anything, because parents can’t support.<br>孩子们在移交给孤儿院时没有出生证明，没有任何手续，因为没有父母不能支持。<br>And as you know: When you don’t have a birth certificate, you don’t exist. You end up in Europe.<br>以及正如你知道的：在欧洲你没有出生证明的话，你是“不存在”的。<br>Now with us pressurizing with the arrest of … what I call … the “Utah pedophile” … now with this we have come to a new understanding even the international police was aware of it now we show the source.<br>现在随着逮捕压力的增加……我称它什么……那个“犹他州的恋童癖”……现在因为这个我们有了新的认识即使国际警察已经知道，现在我们还是指出来源。<br>00:20:02<br>That orphanages are getting used in Morocco to bring children into Europe.<br>他们通常通过摩洛哥把那些孤儿带到欧洲。<br>And “False Hope” is structured. It is on the website.<br>而“假希望”是组织者—通过网站。<br>So now we found out how the children are ending up in Europe.<br>所以现在我们找出了那些孩子最后是如何到达欧洲的。<br>Don’t forget, I go back into … listen to the communication of last week.<br>不要忘记，我追溯到……上周听到的信息。<br>There were two moroccan girls in 1990’s which were murdered.<br>曾经有两个摩洛哥的孩子在1990年被谋杀。<br>By child abusers. It’s known as the “Dutroux Case” in Belgium.<br>那些被虐待的儿童们，被称为比利时“迪特鲁案例”。<br>Now you got the message: Helping in orphanages in Morocco.<br>现在你得到的是这样的消息：“帮助在摩洛哥的孤儿院”<br>Be aware: A woman, who cannot cook now has become a scam finder of the Keshefoundation.<br>应该意识到：一个不会做饭的女人，怎么能够成为发现凯史基金会骗局的人？<br>And a woman who says （she） was part of the Intelligent Service of United States … is actually part of the Intelligence of the European Country which they tracking the children and she asks for the children’s photograph.<br>一个女人说她是美国智囊团成员……实际上是欧洲国家的情报工作者，他们跟踪孩子，她要求孩子们的照片。<br>Be careful very clearly who we are dealing with.<br>要小心，我们非常清楚他们是谁，我们正在处理。<br>Interpol and FBI in United States are into these two beautiful Double-Act now.<br>And soon they will be arrested. The same way as we got the gentleman in Utah.<br>国际刑警以及FBI清楚这两个演出的漂亮的双簧戏。现在，很快他们将被捕。同样，那个犹他州的绅士也是一样的下场。<br>But now we want to find out:<br>但是现在我们想知道：<br>There is a case sitting with CIA in respect to the girl who went missing in Spain was trafficked to Morocco through the organization of the “False Hope” into Europe.<br>这样的情况，那些坐在中情局的女孩和在西班牙失踪的女孩通过摩洛哥被“假希望”贩卖到欧洲。<br>That child from age of 5 had not been seen. Now the file looks that our “HopeFalse” of everything is well into criminal activities.<br>那个5岁的孩子也没见到。现在看起来都是“假希望”的犯罪活动。<br>So we warn you, it’s our objective to clean up this mess that we can operate clearly.<br>所以我们警告你，收拾这些烂摊子事情是我们的目标，我们非常清楚地运作。<br>For the first time we had a discussion with Kerry Cassidy about energy. We can discuss openly, we are weak, we are strong, we learn, where we make a mistake. So we are coming to the point that we have to take the other part of the Double-Act out of the circulation. People who have no clue about Energy, they come and show.<br>首先我们与凯瑞。卡西迪讨论关于精神，我们可以公开讨论。我们是软弱的，我们是坚强的，我们学习，我们犯了一个错误。简单地说，我们不得不采取另一部分轨道的循环（不太清楚）。不关心能源的人，他们来这里表演。<br>There is something we knew. There is a connection between “Sousan” and “False Hope”, is that they came out with the paper from the Belgium Police which has created by falsely by the Belgium Police Officer himself when we went to Italy to get us back to kill us for the 4th time.<br>我们知道一些事情。就是“苏珊”与”假希望“之间的关系。他们通过比利时警方那些作伪的比利时警员取得情报，当我们从意大利回来，他们四次追杀我们。<br>That we put it on the internet with the advice of the Interpol and the European Court of Justice and immediately the gentleman had a big file to do and there is no need for us to go to Belgium.<br>我们可以直接把关于“绅士“的一个大的文件通过互联网提交给国际刑警组织和欧洲法院,而不需要我们去比利时。<br>So you see how they brought … they said they have a ‘warrant of arrest’ from the Interpol.<br>所以你看他们将如何……他们说他们有一份来自国际刑警组织的“逮捕令“。<br>This is … if you were not with Keshefoundation, you see “Oh, the guy got a criminal police record”.<br>这就是……如果你不是凯史基金会，你会说：”噢，这个家伙得到了刑警记录”<br>This is a false paper which we ourselves put on the internet and within 24 hours the gentleman, police officer was part of the pedophile gang withdrew with everything else, because he knew the Supreme … what you call … Chief of Justice in Belgium would not signed it into the hand of the police Interpol.<br>这是一个伪造的文件，我们自己在24小时之内把它放到了互联网上，那位绅士，警察和恋童癖串通撤回了一切（证据？），因为他知道这个的重要性……所谓的……比利时司法部首席不会签署（逮捕令？）放到国际刑警的手中。<br>So this is a false paper. Now we see it coming up through again “Sousan” showing it, because they are part of the same organization. （If） you don’t understand it then they go and they say: “They have a Interpol arrest.<br>所以这是一个伪造的文件。现在我们通过“苏珊”从头至尾的表演再次看到了它。<br>We put this to stop “Red Circle” to get us back into Belgium to kill and it worked the way we were advised by the Interpol.<br>我们按照国际刑警组织的建议，我们停止回到比利时“红圈”，杀死我们是他们的工作。<br>So, what I advise you:<br>所以，我警告你：<br>Please don’t give the name and Emails or a Skype thing of your wife, your child, your colleges to anyone!<br>请不要泄露你的姓名和邮箱地址或者在Skype上和你妻子聊天，你的孩子 的学校或者任何信息。<br>We have come and advised that a new scam by these people has come into.<br>我们建议提防这些人的新骗局。<br>Why they need your child. Why they do.<br>为什么他们要你的孩子，他们为什么要这么做？<br>Remember Alekz, when he was threatened with his child to be killed, … they went through the mobile phone of the child. The call went to the mobile.<br>记住Alekz,当他受到孩子被杀害的威胁，。。。他们通过手机电话号码，他们准备呼叫这个手机。<br>What apparently is on the internet, you can buy it yourself, is a program that you can open the camera of the children’s mobile phone.<br>显然在互联网上，你可以自己购买一个可以打开相机的儿童手机。<br>And then they take pictures of your child of your own and then they send it to you to threaten you. This is what they’ve done with all the scientists.<br>当他们拿着你的孩子的相片来威胁你，这是他们威胁所有的科学家的惯用伎俩。</p>
<p>Now with collaboration with CIA, with the other Intelligent Services we are raveling how “False Hope” and “Sousan” and the guy in Utah and the “Red Circle” and his operation in Germany are working.<br>现在我们与CIA合作，和通过其它智能服务部门，我们了解到那个住在犹他州的家伙在德国幕后操纵“假希望”还有“苏珊”以及“红圈”里的那些人。<br>And then they think they got something on your child. Because what they’ve actually: You give the address, you give your email, they break into your computer through Skype, find a picture or address or telephone number of your child. They use the mobile of the child which is used at night and they put it back to you.<br>然后他们想他们掳走更多你们的孩子。因为他们已经：你给出的地址，你给出的电子邮箱，他们通过Skype侵入你的电脑，找到你孩子的照片和地址或者电话号码。他们在晚上用手机把照片推送给你。<br>You say “How can they got the picture of my child?”<br>你会说：“他们怎么得到我孩子的照片的？”<br>Today this is what was addressed last week.<br>今天这里有上周他们收集的一些地址。<br>00:25:01<br>Because my darlings: “Sousan” works with the most sophisticated Nano Technology Secret Service in Europe for pedophilia.<br>因为我亲爱的“苏珊”使用最先进的纳米技术服务于那个在欧洲的恋童癖。<br>Now the picture is setting up very well. So I even discussed it this week:<br>Put a aluminum foil, a small aluminum foil with a black tape in front of the camera of your children, your laptops, your i-pad [on] the back and the front.<br>现在这些照片已经收集建立很好了。我这周甚至讨论：用黑胶带绑一个铝箔，一个很小的铝箔在你孩子的相机镜头上，在你的手提电脑，你的i-pad的背面和前面的镜头上。<br>These people who threaten you [and] they gonna kill you, they [are] actually using your own camera in your hand because you don’t know [that] there is such a program built.<br>这些人威胁要杀死你，他们实际是使用你自己手里的这些设备或程序，因为你并不知道他们有这样的计划。<br>It’s been built apparently by the Belgium’s in the background for this job.<br>很显然是比利时在背后支持这些工作。<br>So we advise you as ONE Nation, ONE Planet, ONE Race … we are looking after the human race, ALL of us.<br>所以我们警告你，作为一个国家，一个星球，一个种族。。。我们会看顾人类，我们是一体的。<br>Since we announced the situation last Thursday with the rest of Utah and the killing of the judge, whatever they’ve done to themselves in United States it’s their problem and knowing that “Red Circle” is on the run with his team in Germany … we have even found … we have communication copies that the gentlemen in Germany who work with the gentleman “Red Circle” in Antwerp, are communicating with the officer which produced that letter which “Sousan” has put on the internet.<br>因为上周四我们宣布了犹他州法官的杀戮情况，无论他们自己在美国做了什么他们的问题是知道“红圈”组织仍在德国运行。。。我们即使找到。。。我们有与那位在德国的绅士以及与绅士一起工作的在安特卫普的“红圈”里的那些人的的信件副本。<br>We have a copy of all your communications!<br>我们有你们所有的通信副本！<br>I have to call Mr. [??? La Bla Na ???]<br>我要给[??? La Bla Na ???]先生打电话。<br>So we have a full circle. We know how they operate.<br>所以我们有所有的证据，我们知道他们的运作方式。<br>Please protect your children who have mobile phone immediately.<br>请立即看顾好你的孩子，那些人有他的手机资料。<br>You need to have: Don’t use white tape.<br>你需要：不要用白色胶带。<br>You can use a small square of aluminum foil.<br>你可以使用一块小的铝箔。（遮住所有摄像头）<br>Use a plaster you use for your children to cover their wound … and cover their camera.<br>就像用为你的孩子用石膏覆盖伤口。。。盖住他们的摄像头。<br>Both front and back.<br>前面和后面都遮住。<br>Even your Laptop.<br>甚至你的手提电脑。<br>This is a program they’ve written and they come into your operation.<br>这是他们编写的一个程序允许他们进入你的系统进行操作。<br>First of all they come in, … they take everything, … and then …<br>首先他们会进来。。。他们窃取所有信息，。。。然后。。。<br>Most of you Skype users noticed in the past few months [that you are] getting a lot of attacks, your computers are getting wiped out and [you have a] problem.<br>大多数Skype用户注意到过去几个月你受到大量攻击，你的电脑变慢或者出现其他问题。<br>These are the people who are coming in and it’s all done by “Sousan”.<br>这都是那个“苏珊”指示这些人干的。<br>You know, “Sousan” in Persian means “A Needle”. You poke and you do what you like.<br>你知道，“苏珊”在波斯语的意思是“刺激（针状物）”。喜欢用针戳你。<br>So we know, she is a pedophile.<br>所以我们知道，她是个恋童癖。<br>There is no doubt about “Sousan”.<br>名副其实的“苏珊”。<br>Because she’s asking for peoples pictures of their daughter.<br>因为她索要人们的女儿的照片。<br>Somebody who spoke:<br>How many of your decent people go and piss in peoples garden and then ask the other ones for the childrens pictures? Your daughters picture?<br>某人曾说：<br>有多少体面的人在别人的花园里撒尿然后又向别人索要他们的孩子的照片？你们的女儿的照片？<br>We can release it. This has become part of our file with Interpol and the rest.<br>我们可以释放它。这些文件适合提交给国际刑警组织和其他等等。<br>Now the file has started on a “False Hope” which  now the Moroccan family lawyers have got involved in because it’s their children which are going missing.<br>现在这个文件已经使“假希望”卷入那些在摩洛哥家庭失踪的孩子的案件。<br>People who can not even cook now they become scamers, we become scamers for them because you understand why?<br>那些不会做饭的现在变成骗子，说我们变成骗子你知道为什么吗？<br>They are going bankrupt because Mr. “so and so” in Utah has gone, the income has gone.<br>他们正走向破产因为“如此这般”先生在犹他州已经成为过去。<br>Nobody wants children at the moment til they find another nest hole which is what they built now:<br>此刻没有人想要孩子直到他们找到新的安乐窝：<br>A “Scam Keshefoundation” and the rest of it.<br>一个“凯史基金会骗局”以及其他等等。<br>We invite you to make one because we want to see who is coming in your net. I told you for 6 months Interpol, CIA, FBI, Russian Intelligence they sat on all the communication which was made with the “Red Circle” and the Utah guy. And all the people who went there to pick.<br>我们邀请你看看，是谁侵入你的网络。我告诉你6月国际刑警组织,中央情报局,联邦调查局,俄罗斯情报局，他们将开庭审判 “红圈”和犹他州的同性恋。以及所有去那里挑选的人。<br>And when they got it out the judge killed himself because they had everything in their computer.<br>他们取出法官自杀（的证据？）因为他们有所有他们电脑里的信息。<br>They know which child they like and their behavior.<br>他们知道他们喜欢哪一个孩子以及他们的行为。<br>So this is nothing to do with us.<br>因此我们没有什么要做的了。<br>But they are using us and what you bring to teach us to bring children in for their abuse.<br>但是他们使我们，你给我们的孩子们带来恶劣的影响。<br>Now we break in into the circle of the same thing. These two women never existed suddenly since the Utah man was on the run they created this to discredit.<br>现在我们曝光这个圈子里一些事情，在那个犹他州的男人逃跑后这两个女人突然地编造了这个（对基金会的）诋毁。<br>Why? It’s the same. Look at the same wording, just different name and different address on the email. The same as what happened with “Red Circle”.<br>为什么？同样地，同样的措辞，只是不同的电子邮件地址和不同的名字。<br>These people have killed enough of our children and now we speak and we stand for.<br>这些人杀了足够多我们的孩子们，现在我们指证他们。<br>00:29:21<br>We have filed directly a man who has written all the things … written on the internet, it’s been photographed, that “Yes, I pissed in the garden.”<br>我们有某人记录所有事情的档案。。。记录在网络上的，影像记录，“是的，我在那个花园里撒尿。”<br>So if you did in front of your child according to International [Law] it’s a criminal offense but in Belgium it’s normal.<br>因此如果你对孩子们做了这些，根据国际法律是一种刑事犯罪，但在比利时这很正常。<br>Because you’ve [“Red Circle”] done the same thing with your daughters.<br>And you’ve the same thing with your grandchildren.<br>因为你有“红圈”，他们还会对你们的女儿做同样的事情，以及你们的孙子们。<br>You can do it in your house, whatever you like, [but] not with my child [and] not in my time, Sir!<br>你可以在你的家里做，不管你喜欢什么，但不要在我的时代，对我的孩子们下手，先生！<br>The same with “Sousan”. And the same with “False Hope”. They all came together, when we disturbed the pack. The children are getting stacked up in Morocco, [they] can not be taken anywhere because now everywhere is watching Morocco.<br>同样地“苏珊”以及同样的“假希望”。他们都在一起，我们干扰了他们的计划，在摩洛哥孩子们被藏起来，他们不能被带到任何地方，因为现在到处的人们都盯着摩洛哥。</p>
<p>第二部分<br>00:30:00<br>Just go … we release communication that I have a psychological doc.<br>We never heard of psychological （doc）.<br>去吧……我们公开通信，有一位心理医生。<br>“我们从未听过说心理医生”。<br>But now there is a psychological doc with “Sousan”.<br>We have it in black and white, we release all the communication we’ve done with the Interpol.<br>And then if you read the “False Hope” （says）: “We work for the psychological help in Morocco”.<br>但是现在，有一位心理医生——“苏珊”。<br>我们有这些白纸黑字，我们已经公开所有的通信，已经提供给国际刑警组织。<br>如果你读到有个人叫“无望”，（这些人声称）：“我们在摩洛哥心理援助机构工作。”<br>（Do） you see the connection again?<br>These people are well organized!<br>It’s for US to bring them to justice. CIA is on top of it.<br>The Royal Family of Morocco has been well informed.<br>And I wonder to know if you know （that） the real name of “False Hope” is a Moroccan name.<br>Check. Not American.<br>There is as much blood of me, American blood as is with the “False Hope”.<br>你见到再次连接了吗？<br>这些人很有组织性。<br>为的是让他们在美国受审，CIA在它之上。<br>已经将情报提供给了摩洛哥王室。<br>我很吃惊，“无望”的真名居然是一个摩洛哥名字。<br>切克，不是美国的。<br>很像我的血统，“无望”像是美国血统。<br>So now you see, how you are abused.<br>Because （False Hope） “It gives a good name, we can get a lot”.<br>So please check.<br>Do not donate.<br>现在你看，你真是受辱。<br>因为，（无望）“给一个漂亮名字，我们能拿到很多”。<br>所以切克，不要捐献。<br>We do not go out for getting people but we gout when we see our children are in danger. Even You are in danger.<br>Cover your mobile phones.<br>We do it. Anybody who’s been with Keshefoundation around us: We are all covered for a long time.<br>We were aware （that） Intelligent Services are doing it.<br>But now we understand even the pedophiles has been given the technology to use it.<br>And it is on the internet. You can buy the program.<br>And watch what your child is doing when it says :”I’m at home, Mama”.<br>我们不让人们出去，除非我们看到我们的孩子有危险，甚至你也有危险。<br>屏蔽你的移动电话。<br>我们屏蔽了，我们凯史基金会相关的人员已经屏蔽手机很长时间了。<br>我们注意到，是智能服务器在操作。<br>我们甚至清楚恋童癖也用上这种技术。<br>在因特网上你能买到这种程序，用它观察你的孩子在做什么，当它显示：“我在家，妈妈”。<br>But these people are doing to thousands of us.<br>And the first thing they do: They come through the program called ‘Skype’.<br>Do not use Skype on your laptop!<br>Android: They have managed to break into.<br>The Skype they come in and they take your own picture. And you panic “How did they get the picture?”<br>My darling: It’s a program. You can buy it on the internet.<br>We are going to release the connection, you ca all go and buy and watch the children.<br>但是，这些人正在对成千上万的人们实施这个。首先他们由通讯程序Skype，不要在你的膝上型电脑上使用Skype，他们黑进安卓系统，通过Skype进来拿到你自己的照片，“他们怎样拿到的？”我亲爱的，不过是一个程序，你可以在互联网上买到。我们公布链接，你们都可以买到，用来照看孩子。<br>So please understand:<br>Let us clean up this mess.<br>First of all there is nothing called “Free Energy”.<br>Understand （that） the word “Free Energy” was created by the pedophiles to bring children.<br>And then when one lot （were） gone a new Double-Act has come out.<br>所以，一定要明白：<br>让我们清理这些混乱。<br>首先，没有“自由能源”之说，要理解“自由能源”一词是由恋童癖者创造的，为的是套取你的小孩子。<br>一批消失了，双倍的又出现。<br>Nothing to do with Keshefoundation. Nothing to do with nobody else.<br>Because you understand … I was explaining this just recently.<br>They have abused us for so long, that they see it as their right!<br>（For them） we are stupid. We haven’t found out up to now.<br>（这些事）对凯史基金会起不到作用，没有人能做到。因为你明白，我刚刚正在解释。他们对我们做这些滥事已经相当长时间了，他们以为好像他们很高明，我们是笨蛋：直到现在我们没有发现它。<br>（But） now we are into it （and） they don’t know what to do with （it）.<br>We do not change our position and in a very short time we will receive the support from governments and through Interpol.<br>“Red Circle” is already in the courts, is already in the hand of the Interpol because he has confessed he has shown his … hmm-hmm … doesn’t matter, we don’t know if he’s a woman or a man.<br>但是，现在我们知道内情，他们不知道该怎么办。短期内我们不改变我们的位置，我们将收到来自政府和国际刑警的报告。<br>“红圈”的人已经在司法手里，已经在国际刑警的掌握之下，因为他已经供出，他已经出示他的……，不要担心，我们不知道他是女人还是男人。<br>But he （pissed） in my garden in front of my child.<br>The admission is black and white. It’s finished. That’s a pedophile case.<br>He’s done it himself.<br>Now go to Antwerp and find the guy and say “Have you shown it to my child? Where are my children while you were showing it? They haven’t come back home.”<br>但是他在我花园里面撒尿，在我小孩的面前。他承认的，白纸黑字记录，结束了，那是一个恋童癖的案子。他自己干的。现在，去安特卫普找那家伙，说“你当我孩子的面暴露了？在你暴露的时候，我孩子到什么地方去了？他们没回到家里。”<br>And the same with “Sousan”.<br>And the same with the “False Hope”.<br>These four know a lot of children, where they are hiding or the structure where the bone is.<br>“苏珊”干的同样的事，那个叫“无望”的在做同样的事。<br>这四人知道很多小孩隐藏的地方，或是他们的骨骸埋在哪里。<br>So the circle is opening because we start defending ourselves.<br>And on the run they are making mistakes.<br>We have made a very good bargain with a couple of Intelligent Services.<br>And they come out with our bargain very soon.<br>There are four people which we need to be submitted to European Court of Justice.<br>And those people, they know who they are.<br>Their names partially have been announced in some of the medias.<br>And they all sit in one country, in Belgium.<br>循环打破了，因为我们开始自我保护。<br>他们干了坏事，在逃。<br>我们报出了很好的价格，和一两家智能服务机构，他们很快出来还价。<br>有四个人我们需要他们向欧洲法庭提交证据，这些人，他们知道他们（嫌犯）是谁。他们有些人的名字已经在一些媒体上公布。他们都住在一个国家——比利时。<br>And “Red Circle” is named in that list.<br>Hand over yourself to the security services not in your country. Into the European Court of Justice prison in Den Haag!<br>That’s the only option we have agreed. We are negotiating. Very closely.<br>The only option left is to go to Den Haag （and） hand yourself over.<br>红圈就是名单中的一个。<br>向安全机构交出你自己，而不是你们国家，关进欧洲法庭的海牙监狱。<br>这是我们同意的唯一的选项，我们正在谈判，很密切。<br>唯一能够离开的选择，就是你把自己交给海牙法庭。<br>00:35:02<br>The names are published in the American press.<br>And the names of the victims are published in France magazines.<br>Children which were gone missing.<br>And the others are on the run.<br>（嫌犯的）名字已经在美国出版公开了，受害者的名字已经登载在法国的杂志上了。<br>孩子们已经失踪。<br>另一些罪犯在逃。<br>A lot of people made a program that “Look they are showing the Interpol arrest!”<br>And if you can read Flemish, it says on top from the Belgium police from the same office where the supporters of the German sit. With the same name.<br>We release … all these things are documented and ready to go to the hearing in the court, when he sets up soon.<br>And then, they play the game.<br>And you look at the phase. It’s a pedophile phase.<br>许多人制作程序来展示：“看，公开了他们被国际刑警逮捕。”<br>如果你认识佛莱蒙语，说到在比利时警界高层，与德国支持者同一个办公室，（有一位）与他（嫌犯）是同一个名字。<br>我们公开……所有的事情记录在案，准备去法庭旁听，他很快坐上被告席。<br>接下来，就看他们玩游戏，这个时段你就看着，这是恋童癖的时段。<br>So please:<br>It is my responsibility as a head of the Keshefoundation because I bring you here to give you the knowledge through other people to protect you with the same as I give you the knowledge.<br>My technology is safe. So our website, our knowledge internationally has to be safe.<br>所以：这是我的责任，作为凯史基金会首脑，因为我在这里带给你们知识，别人也用我给你的同样的知识来保护你。<br>我的技术是安全的，所以，我们的网站、我们的知识在国际上是安全的。<br>For the first time people start making programs which make sense to be part of.<br>And we’ve seen it with the first discussion today, with Kerry Cassidy.<br>We support Kerry Cassidy from now on as long as she stays correct and her site does not become another abuser site.<br>We are monitoring it very closely.<br>人类首次启动程序，以共同的理念成为（宇宙社区）的一部分。<br>今天第一次与卡瑞-卡西迪讨论，我们已经看到。<br>我们支持卡瑞-卡西迪，从现在起，始终支持她维持正常，她的网站不会成为别的滥用者的站点。<br>我们在密切监视中。<br>And anyone on this channel or a Keshefoundation Youtube （channel） or anywhere （who） puts a telephone number or an email or an address （in the chats）: We block you.<br>You’ll never be able to participate.<br>Because if you are friends, it’s a different thing.<br>If you are fishing here … you can go and fish in prison, the way it’s done in Utah at the moment.<br>来到这个频道或KF Youtube频道的每一位，或你从无论哪里，给我们电话号码、email或通讯地址，我们都要遮挡。<br>你将永远无法参与。(这里指那些坏人)<br>因为，如果你是朋友，那又是另一回事。<br>如果你来这里钓鱼，……那你可以去大牢里面钓鱼，那条路修好了，此刻就在犹他州。<br>So please understand very clearly:<br>Do not … they use women now to get to the man to get to their children because “Man can go she talks so sweet” and after two meetings, two talks on the line “Can I have the picture of your daughter?”<br>We have it. We got it in black and white.<br>所以，请非常清楚地理解：<br>不要……现在他们以女人面目出现，去接触男人或接触他们的孩子，因为“她说话甜美男人才能心动”，之后见几次面，在线交谈几次，“可以把你女儿的照片给我吗？”<br>我们有这些（证据），我们拿到手，白纸黑字在那儿。<br>So please be careful with “Sousan”!<br>It means it’s going to prick you very bad and then when it hurts, it’s too late. You lost your child because it’s already sold.<br>That she has to deliver.<br>所以千万小心“苏珊”！<br>它将会刺痛你很深，当她真正伤害你，那就太迟了，你丢失了你的孩子，她已经被卖掉，她已经（把孩子）交出去了。<br>So please it’s my job. We do not go every Thursday morning.<br>If you have development we explain to you.<br>We have fired against Antwerp because this is no discussion, there is no debate!<br>Pedophilia is confirmed.<br>“I piss in the garden in front of a child and write a poet about it. So to me it’s normal”<br>所以，这是我的工作，不是每个周四的早晨我们都去。<br>如果你开发出来，我们解释给你。<br>我们已经向安特卫普开火，不需讨论，不需辩论！恋童癖确证无疑。<br>“我在花园当小孩子的面撒尿，然后写诗，这对我是常事。”<br>It’s not! Because the guy in Utah made videos about it!<br>I can’t have a child more than 30 seconds on my lap before I play with it<br>This is all in the hand. It’s in the court in Utah.<br>This guy is gonna spend a lot of time with his friend in the “Red Circle”.<br>不光如此！因为犹他州那个滥人还制作了视频！<br>小孩子在我膝上不能超过30秒，在我玩他之前。<br>这都是在他手里的，在犹他法院。<br>这个家伙很多时间和他的“红圈”里的朋友泡在一起。<br>So we are not making allegation.<br>He has written it. We copied it. It is in the hand of the Interpol.<br>Now we are packing up his interactions.<br>It’s getting done. What I told you what we were doing in Utah took us 9 months.<br>Now the circle is so big .. we don’t even know if we can find a prison to put all these guys in.<br>所以，不是我们在下断言。<br>他已经写下来了，我们复制，现在在国际刑警手里。<br>现在我们正在放弃和他互动。<br>已经完成了，做到这些，在犹他州我们用了9个月的时间。<br>这个圈子是如此之大，甚至我们不知道是否有监狱能全部关押下他们。<br>25.000 Pedophiles.<br>It was the biggest pedophiles-gang up to now ever done internationally.<br>And it’s headed. Actually monitored by Utah, headed by “Red Circle”.<br>And it’s so normal to them.<br>25000恋童癖，是最大的恋童癖群落，到目前为止，一直在国际间漫延，一直有人领导，事实上，是受犹他州这边管控，由“红圈”领导。他们已经习以为常。<br>And I’m writing to the family:<br>“Can we know that has he pissed in front of you? Or has he played more than 30 seconds with the child on the lap with two daughters （??? up to three words acoustically hard to understand.） ?“<br>我写信给那个家庭：<br>“我们可以了解他是否当你面撒尿？或他把孩子放在他膝盖玩上超过30秒吗，和你两个女儿？（……）<br>So we are not making accusation.<br>We have email in black and white. We are filing a case. The case is getting ready and is for “Why do you need to piss in the garden in front of a two year old child? Not once. A numerous time when the child was alone in the garden.”<br>So please do not! Under no circumstances even go on a website or when you see “False Hope” or “Sousan”.<br>Because they take your IP. Your IP is sold. Your children are （’offside’ ? - hard to hear clearly this last word）<br>所以，我们不是在制造指控。<br>我们已经发e-mail，白纸黑字，我们归档一个案例。是为了准备：“为什么你需要在花园里面撒尿，在两岁孩子面前，而且不止一次？很多情况是孩子单独在花园的时候。”<br>所以请不要！无论怎样也不要继续留在网页上，当你看到“无望”或“苏珊”。<br>因为，他们拿到你的IP地址，你的IP地址被卖出去，你的孩子……<br>Robert electric bill<br>罗伯特的电子帐单<br>00:39:48<br>Now we go back to our education. This is why we are here.<br>We educate you about the ethos of the world, true work.<br>Now we teach you about the ethos of science.<br>现在我们回到我们的教学，这是我们来这里的目的。<br>我们教导你们世界社区理念，真正的工作。<br>现在我们教导你们科学的社区理念。<br>In the teachings of today in the morning when I was with Kerry Cassidy in this program  we saw a gentleman. Apparently I’ve been told he is a regular listener here.<br>He can introduce himself if he likes. He has brought you some news which was interesting to see.<br>在今天上午教学中，我和卡瑞-卡西迪，在程序中我们见了一位绅士，很显然，我已经被告知他是这里的铁杆听众。如果他愿意，他来自我介绍，他已经带给你们一些新闻，很有趣。<br>Is Robert around  Rick? Then he can introduce to us and say who he is.<br>This is coming on the back of the building of the reactors. The Magrav cores.<br>Robert: Yes, Mr Keshe<br>K: Yes, is that Robert ?<br>R: Yes, I’m here<br>K: We are getting your feedback<br>R: I’m sorry I’m just on my phone and …. One moment . Is that better ? Hello.<br>（some minute of talk to get Roberts audio ok ）<br>罗伯特在瑞克那边吗？在的话向我们介绍一下他自己。<br>这里来到反应器的大楼后面，等离子体内核。<br>罗伯特：是的，凯史先生。<br>凯史：是的，是罗伯特吗？<br>罗伯特：是的，我在这儿。<br>凯史：我们得到你的反馈。<br>罗伯特：报歉，刚在打电话……等一下，那样更好？Hello……（有一段谈话调整罗伯特的音频变好）<br>K: Carry on please. Explain who you are and how what do you gonna show us because what I saw is quite impressive.<br>R: I just sent it to Rick a couple of days ago on Carolina’s recommendation  as well so Rick has that as well. If you could  show<br>Rick: Where did you send it to. My e-mail ?<br>Ro: Messenger<br>K:  You gotta start learning how to use that messenger  somehow you get everything ….<br>凯史：继续开始吧。说明一下你是谁，你打算怎样展示我看到的那些令人激动的东西。<br>罗伯特：一两天前我把卡罗琳的推荐信传给瑞克了，瑞克那里有份，如果你要展示？<br>瑞克：你传到哪里了，我的e-mail吗？<br>罗伯特：短讯。<br>凯史：你要学习怎样使用短讯，以便每件事……<br>Ri: Well, see I’m getting messages  from 3 or 4 of Carolina’s groups. There is multiple messages from many many people and I have to turn it off because otherwise I get  literally hundreds of e-mails a day.  And I cannot …<br>K: You better stop that<br>Ri: I can’t do it because my back and neck just can’t take it anymore.  My arm and neck and back are thrashing doing  that  so I just can’t do it anymore. Yeah, I’ll try to find it here. Just a minute.<br>K: What is the title of it  ?<br>R: I just figured that that is probably better than me trying to turn on the video. Having bandwidth or whatever the problem was<br>瑞克：好了，我从三、四个卡罗琳小组收到这个短讯。很多很多人发来重复短讯，我只好关掉。否则，我一天逐字看几百条短讯，我不能……<br>凯史：你最好不那样。<br>瑞克：我做不到，我的后背和脖子受不了，我的手臂、脖子和后背超负荷了，所以我不能承受更多，好，我试着找到，等一小会。<br>凯史：短讯标题是什么？<br>罗伯特：也许画图表示更好，让我打开视频。带宽或哪儿有点问题。<br>K: Ok, can you explain to us until we can find this?<br>R: Absolutely, I have my residential service electricity bills from November until now.<br>K: First of all tell  us who you are, where you live. That we can add everything up all together.<br>Ro: My name is Robert Stubblefield  from Utah<br>K (shouting out): Oh my God  Utah again!<br>Ro: He he, I know yeah. We have actually got quite a few people involved up here. I’ve done a small workshop and we’ve made a Magrav<br>K:  You did now have the gentleman coming to pay you a visit by  any chance , to see  if your system …<br>Ro: No<br>凯史：Ok，我们找到之前你接着向我们说吧？<br>瑞克：绝对的。我有11月到现在的家庭电子帐单。<br>凯史：首先，你是谁？住在哪里？这样们能把所有事情联系到一块。<br>罗伯特：叫罗伯特-斯塔布菲尔德，来自犹他州。<br>凯史：（大叫一声）哦，天啦，又是犹他！<br>罗伯特：嗯，我知道，事实上我们相当多的人涉及这里，我们组织了一个小的工作室，制造等离子体（装置）。<br>凯史：你不知道一位绅士曾经付费来参观你们的每一个变化，看你的系统是否……<br>罗伯特：不知道。<br>00:45:00<br>(Keshe) Thank God. OK, carry on please.<br>(Robert) I’ve got my bills from November up until now for my residential service and in November, we used…<br>(Keshe) What is what you are using first…<br>(Robert) The electricity bill the very first month, November, was 2,412 kWh…<br>(Keshe) Yea, but what were you using?… Can you please explain to us? We don’t know.<br>How do you know the Keshe Foundation and how, what did you use to get to these figures, please? …<br>(Rick) Please, can you tell me which group it was exactly? We have different groups…<br>(Robert) Directly from me Rick…<br>(Rick) I mean, which group did you put it in?<br>(Robert) I didn’t put in a group. I put it in directly from Robert Stubblefield.<br>(Keshe) Alright. OK, carry on Robert.<br>(Robert) OK, I actually started Oct 26. I took a little bit longer than some and  …<br>凯史：感谢上帝，好的，请继续。<br>罗伯特：我有11月以来的家庭服务帐单，在11月，我们用了……<br>凯史：你最先用了多少？<br>罗伯特：11月，也就是最先的一个月电子帐单，是2412千瓦时。<br>凯史：好，那你那时用什么？能对我们说明一下吗？我们不知道。你是怎样知道凯史基金会的，你又怎样做得来这些数据（的变化），请吧……<br>瑞克：请告诉我你是哪个小组，我们有不同的小组……<br>罗伯特：瑞克，直接从我……<br>瑞克：我是说你把讯息发到哪个组了？<br>罗伯特：我没有发到小组，我从罗伯特-斯塔布菲尔德直接放进。<br>凯史：OK，继续，罗伯特。<br>罗伯特：OK，事实上是10月26日开始，我用了多一些时间比……<br>(Keshe) Where? From the teaching of the Blueprint?<br>(Robert) Yeah ok ok I went through the Blueprint teachings and then had some questions so I just went back and started watching videos from the first one and ended up finishing it in about mid-November and so that’s why I started keeping the bill in November of this year.<br>The first month in November we used 2,412 kWh.<br>凯史：从哪？从蓝图教学？<br>罗伯特：是的，OKOK,我通过蓝图教学，有些疑问，所以又回去从头到尾观看视频，在11月份，所以，我从当年11月开始保留帐单。<br>第一个月——11月，我们用了2412千瓦时。<br>(Keshe) Is that normal for you? that kind of usage?<br>(Robert) It’s pretty normal for this house. We actually started to use wood in our heater at first, in our wood stove, and then we received the bill for December, which was only 1,471 kWh, so we switched back to the electric heater so I didn’t have to pay for the wood because it’s about $100.<br>凯史：那是你通常用电量吗？常规的？<br>罗伯特：正是这个房屋正常数据？我们首先实际上开始使用木材炉子取暖。然后我们收到12月的帐单，只有1417千瓦时。我们又切换回用电取暖，那我就不用买木材，因为木材要用100美元。<br>(Keshe) So, the 2, 000 whatever, was you still using wood on top of that bill?<br>(Robert) Yea.<br>(Keshe) So are you going back fully on electric now?<br>(Robert) Yea, we are fully on electric now.<br>(Keshe) OK, so the first bill in November, before you installed, was how much?<br>(Robert) 2,412 kWh<br>(Keshe) ok.<br>(Robert) It wasn’t actually that cold in November until the end of November and then when I received the second bill for 1,471 kWh……<br>凯史：那这个2000，不管怎样，是你一直用木材取暖，这个就是你帐单上的最大数据？<br>罗伯特：是。<br>凯史：那现在你又切回去全部用电了？<br>罗伯特：是，现在又全部用电。<br>凯史：OK，那这个12月的帐单，安装（系统单元）之前，是多少？<br>罗伯特：2412千瓦时。<br>凯史：OK。<br>罗伯特：不敢相信，寒冷持续到12月底，我们收到第二次帐单：1471千瓦时……<br> (Keshe) Just wait one second.. Can you see my white board or do you see my browser?<br>Robert) I see your white board. So,<br>(Rick) I found the pictures……<br>(Keshe) We come to you in a second…<br>OK, in November, bill was 2,412 yes? us dollars yes?<br>(Robert) No kWh.<br>凯史：等一下。你能看到我的白板吗，看到我的浏览器吗？<br>罗伯特：看到你的白板。<br>瑞克：我有图片……<br>凯史：我们一会过来……OK，11月帐单是2412美元？<br>罗伯特：不是，是千瓦时。<br>(Keshe) What? kWh? Pardon, kWh… Let me clean up. We don’t need to make a thing wrong. OK, we have this here that is … we have to go to the pen …<br>So you had 2,412 kWh of use in November, ok? … And in December?<br>(Robert) In December we had 1,471 kWh,<br>(Keshe) But you were using more electricity?<br>(Robert) No that’s not the … Oh yes, we were using more electricity, because it actually got 11 degrees colder in December than it was in November as well.<br>凯史：什么？千瓦时？再说一下，千瓦时……我清理一下。我们不要弄错。OK，我们这里有……我们找笔……<br>那么，11月你用了2413千瓦时，OK？那么12月？<br>罗伯特：12月我们用了1471千瓦时。<br>凯史：但是你多用电了？<br>罗伯特：那不是……哦，是的，我们多用电，是因为实际上12月比11月份降温11度。<br>(Keshe) When did you install the system? In November?<br>(Robert) Yes. I installed it in November.<br>(Keshe) You installed it in November…OK.<br>So you saw the first reduction in December?<br>凯史：那你何时安装发这个系统，是11月吧？<br>罗伯特：是的，11月我安装系统了。<br>凯史：你11月安装系统，OK。那你看到12月是第一次下降？</p>
<p>00:50:02<br>Keshe - So you saw the 1st reduction in december. And what is your january bill ?<br>Robert - Then the january bill, just one moment, i’m sorry …<br>Rick - is 839 KWH. It looks like. Is that right ?<br>Robert - Yes! That’s correct !<br>Keshe - So, if we look, you’re down by 60% more or less<br>Robert - Yes, 61%. I believe. That’s what I was looking for. I have got all written down.<br>凯史：那好你看首次降低是在12月份，那你1月份的帐单是多少呢？<br>罗伯特：1月份帐单，稍等下，报歉……<br>瑞克：象是839千瓦时，对吗？<br>罗伯特：是的，非常准确！<br>凯史：所以，我们看到，你减少了60%左右。<br>罗伯特：是的，61%，我相信。我在找，我全部都有记载。</p>
<p>Keshe - Ok! So, what are you using ? You are using the stacker unit the way we showed in the Blue Print.<br>Robert - Yes! I am using the stacker unit. In deccmber, I actually made quite a few more after I got that bill.<br>Keshe - Your electricity bill : how much is this, how much was 2,412 kWh in USD ?<br>Robert - 298 USD there<br>Keshe – 298 USD and how much is your payment bill for January ?<br>Robert – New charge is 103.99 USD<br>Keshe – 103 USD, so in a way you are saving just about 195 USD （average per month）?<br>凯史：OK！那么，你用的什么？你用的是叠子单元，我们蓝图展示过那种？<br>罗伯特：是的！我用的是叠子单元。在12月，我拿到帐单后，的确（减少）很多。<br>凯史：你的电子帐单：是多少？2412千瓦时多少美元？<br>罗伯特：298美元。<br>凯史：298美元，那你1月份的付款单是多少？<br>罗伯特：新费用是103.99美元。<br>凯史：103美元，所以，这样你一个月储存了195美元（每月平均）？</p>
<p>Robert – Yes<br>Keshe – If you multiply by 12, it is nearly 2,400 USD a year savings.<br>Robert – Yeah! Correct ! I also wanted to mention that it’s not just one stacker, necessarily though because I have had several other plugging at a time. That’s two (??)<br>Keshe – Ok but, in a way, it’s nothing else? You are not using anything else but the stacker unit, the technology, the Kesh Foundation technology to reduce your consumptions?<br>Robert – Yes<br>Keshe – Ok. So we are in line because one of the reasons you see this is you have a double phase system in the USA. So you see 66 or 60%.<br>If you have a single phase like in the Western Europe, you see 30%.<br>罗伯特：是的。<br>凯史：如果你12个月加起来算，一年就接近存款2400美元。<br>罗伯特：对，非常正确！我还想说，必要时可以不光只是一个叠子单元，有时我插入几个另一种，有两……<br>凯史：OK，这样，再没用别的吗？你再没用任何别的，除了叠子单元。凯史基金会技术降低你的消费？<br>罗伯特：是的。<br>凯史：OK。所以，我们是一致的。你看到原因之一，在美国用二相供电系统，所以你看（降低）66-60%。如果在西欧用单相供电系统，你能有30%的降低。<br>Now we are testing in as I said in a factory, no, not a factory, in a school, in a chiller.<br>And we are hoping to receive just about 90% reduction.<br>In the 3 phase system, we are working on it, we don’t know yet. It’s only four days, it’s 3 small units and a huge what we call refrigeration, what we call chillers for their school, to give to all the school cool in the heat of Dubai.<br>So we see this is paid and this is a copy of our own Blueprint which we got on the blue boxes.<br>现在我们在测试，我说过，在工厂，除了工厂，还在学校，在致冷系统上。我们希望得到90%的降低，在3相供电系统上，我们正在上面运作，我们还不知道，才四天，有三个小单元和一个大单元，我们称这为致冷装置，是他们学校的冷却系统，为迪拜的所有小学在高温期间致冷。<br>所以，我们看到这是付清的。这是复制我们自己的教学蓝图，我们的蓝盒子的蓝图。<br>So you understand there is no false claim and there is no scam!<br>And this is a man who has made it himself!<br>We see a lot of these things.<br>Vince, would you like…<br>Sorry, Rick, can you stop sharing ! Can you show us his bills so that we can see it !<br>Rick – Sure ! Ok, this… Not clear… Which one is which… Here… There is this one.<br>所以，你理解没有谎称，没有欺骗！是这个人自己做到的！我们看到很多这些事情。<br>文斯，你是否……报歉，瑞克，可以停止共享吗，展示一下他的帐单让我们看看。<br>瑞克：好的!OK，这……不清楚……哪一张……这……这一张是。</p>
<p>Keshe – Yeah ! These are the ones ?<br>Rick – It’s a little blurry but you can kind of see that one and there is another one.<br>Keshe – That’s the historical data. It’s the bills with his name on top of it what he showed us today.<br>Rick – And then, there is the other one. Here, that shows the three months with the kWh used.<br>凯史：好！这些哪一张是？<br>瑞克：有点模糊，但你能看到一张和另一张。<br>凯史：那是历史数据。顶上写着他的名字的那张，今天给我们看过的。<br>瑞克：这是另一张，这张显示了三个月的用电量。</p>
<p>Keshe – It’s 2412, that’s what he told us. We don’t see the bottom. Can you lift it up a little bit. We don’t see it !<br>Robert – （scrambled）  … meter reading on this one you can see that each meter reading lines up with the previous one as well.<br>Keshe – I see that, you’re correct. Is exactly 46531 and goes to 48002. And it follows on. You’re correct. So these are your electricity bills.<br>Robert – Yes that’s correct !<br>!!!! it gets noisy here – cannot understand what is said !!!<br>Rick – (??) I think when you are not speaking Robert that you (??)<br>凯史：这是2412，他刚告诉大家的。看不见按钮，能上来点吗，我看不到它。<br>罗伯特：这张上面的计数行，你能看见每个计数行及它过去的数字。<br>凯史：我看见了，你是对的。的确是从46531跑到48002，之前在，你是对的。那么这些就是你的全部电子帐单了。<br>罗伯特：是的，很正确。<br>（！！！……！！！）<br>瑞克：我想你没有讲的了，那你……<br>第三部分<br>00:55:00<br>Rick: There’s another bill as well, Robert, I think you mentioned it, from someone else?<br>Robert: Yeah that is somebody else’s house that I just put it in January 1st so it was easy to track but ah it showed down as well it shows that it was colder this year for the average daily temperature and he used about 25% less on his as well<br>00:55:00<br>瑞克：有另外的一个帐单，罗勃特，这是你提到它，或来自其他人？<br>罗勃特：是的，那是别人一月一日起的房子，我刚刚把它拿过来做展示，它很容易追踪，它显示今年天气的平均每日温度比较寒冷了，但他节省掉大约 25% 至少在他的之前恐怕</p>
<p>MTK: 25%<br>Ro: Yeah and if you.. and also.. January was colder than December… you can see that on the other bills that I had there um<br>MTK: Yeah yeah we can see.. we can see… we can see. Yeah average per day has dropped from 46 to 34<br>Robert: Also Rick if you put the one up of the graphs, the three graphs. I do not know if you can see it maybe i can show it here.<br>But it is very interesting to note that on the last bill that they sent to me… the two previous ones just had the normal rhetoric “if you find yourself in a.position. …（bla bla）”<br>MTK: Can you show us please? Can you show us yours… which one you are talking about? Rick, can you stop sharing screen, let him show?<br>Rick: Okay<br>Robert: Yeah he will have to turn the video on.. it stopped<br>Rick: Okay just a second…. Are you able to start your video there now Robert? Okay there you go<br>MTK：25%<br>Ro：是的而且如果你。。以及。。一月比十二月寒冷…你能见到在其他的帐单，我那里有 um<br>MTK：是的是我们能见到。。我们能见到…我们能见到。平均每天的数已经从 46 降低到 34<br>罗勃特：也瑞克如果你放上那一个图，那三个曲线图。我不知道，是否你能看见它， 我 能在这里出示它。<br>非常有趣的是当你注意这个帐单的最后一部分，他们发给我的这个…这两个早先的是正常的表达”如果你发现了。…（bla bla］”<br>MTK：你能展示给我们？你的……你正在谈论哪一个？瑞克，你能停止你的荧屏，让他显示？<br>瑞克：好<br>罗勃特：是的他必须把影像打开。。它停止了<br>瑞克：好，马上，罗勃特你能够让那里的你的影像开始吗？好你开始了<br>MTK: Yeah here he comes.. Okay Robert what do you want to show us on the graph?<br>Robert: Ah yeah it is actually the verbiage that is below the graph…<br>MTK; It’s upside down.<br>Robert: Okay.. now it is mirrored backward … Is it okay to you guys?<br>MTK: It’s okay but it is a bit blurred you have to keep it steady so that we can read the number<br>MTK：是的他来在这里了。。好罗勃特你想要在曲线图上表示给我们什么？<br>罗勃特：啊是的它实际上在曲线图下面是废话……<br>MTK；它是，混乱的。<br>罗勃特：好。。现在它被照上来了…你们是不是？<br>MTK：它没问题，它有点模糊，它必须保持稳定，以便我们能读数字</p>
<p>Robert: Okay this what it says on both of the others:<br>“If you find yourself in a position in which you are unable to pay your electric bills …”<br>Anyways just goes through rhetoric there… but on the most recent one that i have received… it’s got a whole different tone to it here<br>MTK: What does it say now?<br>罗勃特：好，这是它其它人的内容（图中这段英文）<br>”如果你找你一个你不能够支付你的电帐单的位置……”<br>那里仅仅是各种各样的修辞…这是在最近的我收到的……这是它给的一个完全的不同声音<br>MTK：它现在说什么？</p>
<p>Robert: This one says<br>“Please consider helping your neighbours in need of energy assistance by using  the enclosed envelope to make a tax deductible donation”<br>Now they see that it is dropping and asking me to help others …who can not pay for their own..<br>MTK: It is fantastic You already have … you have given to your neighbours 28% reduction … 25%  reduction. This is fantastic.<br>But you got to look. But you got to look… you are an American…<br>America reduces or  on average between 10 to 11 million barrels of oil a day.<br>And on the back of it you import something about  4 to 6 million barrels from different countries.<br>罗勃特：这一个说<br>“ 请考虑帮助你的邻居的能源需求而使用所附的信封做一个捐赠式的税”<br>现在他们看起来正在降低身价而请求我帮助其他人……谁不能为他们自己支付。。<br>MTK：它是奇怪的，你已经…你已经给你的邻居 28% 的减少……25% 减少。这是奇妙的。<br>但是你看。但是你看…你是一个美国人…<br>美国平均减少一般说来在一千万到一千一百万桶油一天之间。<br>而且它在进口来自不同的国家的大约四百万至六百万桶。<br>If your government  who is trying to make savings to support other activities of your country and they won’t use the money surplus for what I call  … wars …<br>It makes it very, very interesting reading.<br>This is what I explained to the Italian officials and it just hit them straight away in the face  …exactly why and how we found support in Italy.</p>
<p>Look at this. This is very interesting. You have saved $198.<br>如果你的国家的政府的正在试图使用储蓄来支持其他活动那么他们将不会用为…战争…准备的盈余的钱<br>它是真正的、非常有趣的阅读。<br>这是我跟意大利官员解释的和跟他们当面直言的东西……这就是我们为什么以及如何在意大利被支持。<br>看这。这非常有趣。你已经节省＄198 。</p>
<p>We say 50% of this is the cost of fuel the other 50 is the profit and the charges.<br>我们说的50%是燃油的支出，另50%是收益和另花钱</p>
<p>That is let’s say for the sake of being round figure you save $100 in a month… sorry $100  in fuel ….the fuel which your nation had to import.<br>就是说凑整的节约有$100一个月…对不起$100在油上，是国家必须进口的</p>
<p>If 1 million American houses are helped with this system, that now we have set up 5 factories to do this, You save your nation 100 million.<br>假如1百万美国家庭有这个系统，我们用5个厂做这些，你为你的国家节约1百万</p>
<p>That is per month!<br>这是每个月。<br>In a nation which is going bankrupt because of under debt … In one year you see the figure adds up very nicely…. to one billion!<br>因为下面 的债务一个国家在走向破产，一年中你可看到加起来的数据非常完美，到了十亿！<br>  （a million roughly multiplied by 12）【1百万粗略地乘以12】<br>Robert: And we create a situation where people have more money in their pockets to spend on the goods that are created<br>01:00:00<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>You see down now how the figures add up.<br>I explained this to the Italian officials and they understood immediately.  What is here is for the saving of the nation. And if you add, let’s say, we said one million houses . Add, let’s say, we can support … you have something  like 300 million houses in United States.<br>If you can support a hundred millions of them in next five years you add two zeros in front of it.<br>Hundred billion a year saving for a nation.<br>Just on fuel. This is only on heating!<br>罗勃特：而且我们创造了这样一种情形是人们在他们的口袋中赚较多的钱来花费到他们自已生产货物上。<br>Keshe 先生：<br>你现在见到下面的图的内容。<br>我向意大利官员解释这，而且他们立刻懂了。什么是国家的储蓄。你继续，让我们说，我们刚说一百万楝房子。再增加，让我们说，我们能继续算……像美国有三亿楝房子的。<br>如果你能下个五年支援一亿计的这个，。<br>一个国家有一年一千亿储蓄。<br>仅仅在燃料上。这只有在暖气上！<br>Look at what can happen the same kind of reduction in your motor industry.<br>There you hit every American household. You are talking about another 3-400 billion. The saving for the nation can pay for most of the debts of the nation which is escalating.<br>And then you add the same thing with your health care, which is run out of control.<br>With the pens and the pads. Keshe foundation technology will shift the nation which is in the process of bankruptcy, into profit-hood.<br>To become profitable, to become what it should be as a solid nation.<br>And this is one technology.<br>This, when the officials understand what’s on the table, now you know why the Chinese are greeting us with open arms.  Because they did the calculation, they understood the calculation.<br>It’s not that the oil industry is going to  be destroyed. The oil industry is already destroyed.  Because people can’t afford paying. Fuel has brought bankruptcy to the nations.  Now you don’t need to.<br>The figures, if your government understand, it’s in black and white.<br>来能看在你的马达工业中发生相同类型的什么事。<br>在那里你加进每个美国家庭。那你正在谈论另外 三- 四千亿。国家的储蓄能支付正在扩大的国家的大部份债务。<br>然后你用这相同的事加进你的医疗那这个数将暴表。<br>藉由这些方法。Keshe 基金会的技术将会让在破产的程序中的国家转移到富裕国家，<br>变成有益的，它应该变成当做一个可靠的国家。<br>是这一种技术。<br>当官员在桌子上了解这些，现在你知道华人为什么正在热烈地欢迎我们。因为他们做了计算，他们了解计算。<br>它不是油工业要被破坏。油业已经被破坏。因为人们不能负担支出。燃料已经带破产给国家。现在你也是不需要的。<br>那图，如果你的政府懂得，它是在黑白分明的。<br>You don’t need me, YOU put it on.<br>Now we have signing 5 factories, in United States,  going into production.  We estimate they should reach a  production between five of them between hundred thousand to two hundred thousand  a month in the coming year.<br>Then you can see how will it make an inroad in Keshe foundation  supporters and manufacturers , to write off the debts of a nation.<br>And it’s in black and white. We don’t  need to go anywhere we are not speculating.<br>This is what we say.<br>Ok, we saved this amount of money that you pay for national debts. But what about  instead of  throwing the saving away, stop spending on war machines? That the money can be spent on the nation?<br>Better schools, better care for the eldery. Better environment for people to live.<br>This is what hit the Italian. Italian prime minister saw it and he’s going for it.<br>你不需要我算，你自已算<br>现在我们有签署 5间工厂，在美国进入生产。我们估计他们中的五个厂的生产，那么他们在来年应达到每月十万到二十万之間的产量，。<br>然后你能见Keshe 基础支持者和制造业者是如何去掉国家债务的。<br>而且它是在黑白的。我们不需要去任何地方我们不用思考。<br>这是我们说的。<br>好，我们节省了大量的支付给国家的债务的钱。但是省下的储蓄会怎样，停止在战争机器上花费？钱能花费在国家上？<br>比较好的学校，比较好的老人的照顾。更好的环境让人们住。<br>这是为什么打动意大利人。意大利总理已看见它，而且他正在使用它。<br>The oil industry has come to it’s climax. There is no more they can take us for ransom because alternative energies are there.<br>And all of them, most of them , are coming through   the back of Nanotechnology  and plasma technology which we have introduced partially. There are other scientists who are contributing into it as well.<br>We have become an international workforce, scientific workforce,  that can not be ignored.  And that’s why I told, in Kerry Cassidy, watch us in next 4 to 6 weeks. You see how the governments who  understand this figures, opens the door for them.<br>The oil nation companies  are running to the Keshe foundation faster than non oil  producing countries because the 100 dollar 120 dollar per barrel  is gone to 25  , 29. If you can get it.<br>The revenue will not come by selling. Now the revenue will come by saving and this is a direct saving and the beauty with this is you create job with it and as Robert said .<br>油业已经到达它的高峰。他们不能给我们更多的好处，替代的能源在这里<br>而且他们全部，他们的大部份，已经度过，我们部份地介绍的纳米技术和等离子技术的之后。有其它科学家进来做着很好的贡献。<br>我们已经成为一个国际的工作平台，科学的工作平台，那不能被忽略。而且那是在往后的 4-6个星期内，在凯瑞 Cassidy ，你会见到了解这个图的政府如何为他们打开大门。<br>因为 100 元到120 元每桶降至 25,29 ，所以生产油的国家正在比非生产油的国家更快速地跑向 Keshe 基金会。如果你能明白它。<br>收入将不再依赖买卖。现在收入将会依赖节约，这是直接的节约并且美丽的是你用它创造工作，正象罗勃特说的。<br>The money you have, now you can spend more on your national products. To boost the nation. This is a direct boosting of funds of a nation.<br>If, and we said, we’re going to come into operation in June, July with our American election. You watch when it’s done I tell you how.<br>The man who supports this kind of saving for the nation and supports to use the savings for a peaceful  actions  for the nation. Not to go into arms. And  does it open transparency, will get the support of the Keshe foundation supporters in  the United states voting.<br>We already know roughly which candidate we are going to put up. Well respected amongst American nation.<br>01:05:00<br>On the platform of Peace, saving on Energy, saving on Fuel, saving on Health Care, on the back of a new technology, giving America a new chance to stand.<br>And, the way I told you before. People in United States or no nation will say “No” to guaranteed new jobs, new industry, all the oil industries are dying.<br>As a politician said, this is the breath of fresh air we’ve been waiting for.<br>你有的钱，现在你能在你的国家产品上花费更多。这是有利于国家。一个国家的资金的会直接提高。<br>如果，而且我们说，我们在六月要进入操作，用我们的美国选举的七月。当完成了的是，我告诉你时，你看如何。<br>为国家支援这种解救的男人而且支援为国家使用储蓄作为一个和平的行动。不进入双臂。而且做它公开透明，将会获得投票的 Keshe 基础在美国的支持者的支持。<br>我们已经概略地知道我们要投宿哪一个候选人。很好地尊敬了在美国国家当中。<br>01:05:00<br>在和平的平台上，可从能源上节约、在燃料上节约，在医疗上节约，在这新技术的基础上，给美国一个重新站起来的机会。<br>并且，象我以前告诉你的那样。在美国或没有地方的人们会对有保证的新工作，新工业说“不”，所有的石油工业正在死亡。<br>如一位政客说，这是我们一直等候的新鲜空气。<br>And all this was more or less getting mottled up with all this scam and everything else by the guy in Utah, and the “Red Circle” in Antwerp, and then now the double act for you not to see<br>Because if they could keep this going, they had the children and they were well paid.<br>Now, you see the figures. $198 in one month, $200 in one month. You put $200, let’s look at the figures in a different angle, totally. You put $200, that’s $2,500 roughly, per family （per year）…<br>而且通过这些骗局和其他由犹他的安特卫普和 “ 红圈 会” 的人做地每件事物，让所有地这些事或多或少地更多彩，这些在背后已为你们花了两倍努力<br>因为如果他们继续这样做，他们会有（继续侵害）孩子，而且他们会得到好报酬。<br>现在，你看那个图。一个月＄198，在一个月内$200。你当＄200,让我们从另一个不同的角度看那个图，总体地。你按＄200 ，那概略地是＄2,500，每一家庭［每年］…</p>
<p>… multiplied by how many families are in the U.S.? $200 million? Multiply this, you have 300/400 million population, let’s say half of it are the families or the people who do, if you have this with 200 million families, …<br>…以在美国多少家庭相乘？二亿美元？乘这，你有 三、 四亿人口，让我们说它一半是家庭或者人们是，如果你和二亿个家庭有这，…</p>
<p>… add up the figures.<br>（ Mr. Keshe is mumbling some calculations ）<br>That are $500 billion<br>…加起来。<br>［ Keshe 先生正在喃喃而语做计算］<br>那是＄五千亿</p>
<p>I want to know which member of the election team did, any of them, will say no to this:<br>Peace for Energy.<br>Now you understand why was the conference in Rome. Energy in exchange for Peace.<br>And you see the savings for a country. We are talking for the figures which is on the table. We don’t know, look at the corporations, how much they are saving, with huge buildings, big factories.<br>This is just a common mans saving. Very simple.<br>One, two, three, that’s your first three （zeroes from the right）.<br>我想要知道哪一个当选的团队做了，他们之中的任何一个，都会对这说不：<br>为和平的能源。<br>现在你了解为什么为罗马的会议。以能源交换和平。<br>而且你看到一个国家的储蓄。我们和那桌子上的人物谈论这个图。看这个公司，我们不知道，这极大的建筑物，这大工厂他们能节约多少。<br>这只是通常人储蓄方法。非常简单的。<br>一，二，三，那是你的最先的三个［零从右边］.</p>
<p>The second three is here, one, two, three.<br>第二个三个零在这里，一，二，三。</p>
<p>Your third zeroes are here, one, two, three.<br>第三个的三个零在这里，一，二，三。</p>
<p>Now you still got one more zero left and two by twenty five is fifty. OK?<br>现在你在左边仍然得到另外更多的一个零，二个二十五是五十。好？</p>
<p>Now you calculate. You are saving for your Nation.<br>Literally, in one year, American nation walks out of debts.<br>$500 Billion U.S. dollars made saved by the Americans for their own Nation that they can spend it back in their nation. Do we need wars when there is such a beautiful technology sitting on the table?<br>The ones who want to take this savings to buy more arms to kill? What’s the use for them?<br>The same factories which are making arms can produce these technologies across the space.<br>You do not know what we put on the table last Thursday, last Tuesday, watch the last Tuesday!<br>现在你计算。你正在为你的国家做积蓄。<br>真正地，在一年中，美国脱离国家债务。<br>五千亿美元的节约被美国人为他们自己的国家作出来，有如此的一种美丽的坐在桌子上技术时，我们需要战争吗？<br>想要用这积蓄买较多的军品去杀戮的人？他们使用什么呢？<br>正在制造武器的一些工厂能这些技术生产达到这样。<br>你不知道上星期四知道我们放在桌子子上的是什么吗？，上星期二，看上星期二！<br>The ‘Universal Food System’ can save you even more to import food!<br>Because now you don’t even need food to eat.<br>It runs in Trillions.<br>Now you see the power of the technology.<br>Not on us!<br>On an American electricity bill from one house, and most probably, this is not such a big house.<br>Robert:<br>And more importantly, for some of us, no one goes hungry hopefully, if we place them properly, no one goes hungry, you know…You can save $100 trillion a year, but it’s not important if somebody is going hungry on the street.<br>Keshe:<br>I wonder, would, would any of the two presidential candidate front runners will exchange the seed for the man we are going to put up.<br>We are talking to the background of people, we are looking, we know who we are going to put up as the next president of the United States, on the basis of these bills.<br>Nothing else!<br>We bring bills, electricity bills, health bills, people with the cancer which survived …<br>普遍性的食物系统’能节省你更多入口的食物！<br>因为你甚至不需要食物吃。<br>它有万亿个的在运行。<br>现在你见到这个技术的力量。<br>不是在我们身上！<br>是在的一个美国一楝房子电费单上，或许，这不是一楝的大房子。<br>罗勃特：<br>而且更重要，为我们其中的一些，没有人有饥饿感，如果我们适当地安置他们，没有人会饥饿，你知道……你能节省＄100万亿 每一年，但在街道上某个人是变饥饿的是不重要的。<br>Keshe：<br>我想知道投票给哪个候选人会换来人类的那种子。<br>我们正在和人们的背景内的人说话，我们正在看，我们知道谁是我们要投票的，象下一位美国总统，根据这些帐单。<br>无别的！<br>我们带来帐单，电费单，医疗帐单，有还在存活的患癌的人们……<br>01:10:00<br>And in June, July we enter the American election on the basis of technology for peace.<br>Now you understand how powerful it is, now that we have taken the scammers out of the scamming.<br>This is American data, not ours, we don’t built it, it’s a small man out of Utah, $2,500 per year savings. That’s only in the house.<br>You put another $2,000 on the fuel once you use a Magrav system on the car.<br>You put another $2 - $3,000 per year on Health Care, which you don’t need to. A pen will save your life from the pain.<br>And then you put on top maybe another $10,000 saving on food where you don’t need to eat where you can supply energy from:<br>The bill … runs in Trillions.<br>而且在六月，七月，我们为和平依靠技术进入美国选举。<br>现在你了解它是多么有力，现在我们已经从这骗局拿出了骗子。<br>这是美国数据，不我们的，我们不建造它，它是一个从犹他来的普通男人，每年 $2,500 积蓄。那就是只有在房子。<br>一但你在汽车上使用一个 Magrav 系统你放在燃料上的＄2,000可用在别处。<br>你每年放在医疗＄2-$3,000也可用在别处，你也不需要了。一枝笔将会解救你生活的痛苦。<br>然后再你不需要吃食物，更上一个层次，也许另外＄10,000 积蓄有了后，帐单…将升到兆单位。<br>And this is a moderate family, not a noble rich family American one in the top.<br>Then you see how many houses will have would we change the churches into homes that aren’t churches empty properties that can feed all the homeless people in the United States. I don’t understand why there is anyone on the streets.<br>Open the churches and all the properties which are owned by the churches in United States, （then） you have no homeless. You have surplus of homes.<br>And give them a unit that you don’t need to do anything with it. They have their electricity, they have their heating, they have everything you need. You create a new generation of employment, a new generation of the Cycle of Life.<br>Made by planet Earth for members of his nation.<br>而且这是一个普通的家庭，不地在顶端的一个高贵的富有的美国家庭。<br>然后你见到将会多少房子，我们将会把教堂变成家用房，那不再是空教堂和空的大房子，它们能在美国供养所有的无财产的人家。我不了解为什么在街道上会有某些人。<br>打开教堂和被美国的教堂拥有的所有的房产， 这你没有无家可归的。你房屋还有盈余。<br>给他们一个它不需要对它做任何事的一单元。他们就有了电力，有了暖气，他们有他需要的每件事物。你产生新一代的就业方式，新一代的可自循环生产的生活。<br>是地球行星根据他自已的成员而定做的。<br>Now you understand how we becoming One Planet, One Nation, One Race.<br>These figures, … when the politicians see …<br>Understand （that） this is why I put it down this way.<br>I explained to you last week or this week:<br>In the Peace Process with Iran, the head of Senate, when right the committee of the senate for opposing the Iranian Peace was going full blast. “We going to oppose it, it will not pass the Senate”.<br>I have put one thing to the member of the Senate in the discussion like very much what we did with Kerry Cassidy today.<br>现在你了解如何我们成为的一个行星、一个国家，一个种族。<br>这些图，…当政客们见到…<br>或懂得这些是为了什么我才把它们（技术）放出来。<br>上星期和这星期我都在跟你们解释：<br>在伊朗的和平程序中，叁议院的领导，在反对伊朗和平的叁议院的委员会中的势力快速彭胀。” 我们去反对它，它将不会通过叁议院 “.<br>我给叁议院的成员放一件事物去讨论，是与今天我们对凯瑞•卡西迪所做的非常相似。<br>You tell me. The Peace Process with Iran brings within 5 to 20 million jobs into the United States. Which member of Senate is going to oppose it?<br>And we saw, within days, the same as the Utah man walked to the FBI: The head of the opposition of the Senate to the Iranian Peace resigned.<br>Because it made sense. Politicians understand this. When you look at these figures, to you I saved $198, $150 in one month, but the politicians look at the National figures!<br>This is where it hits.<br>你告诉我。伊朗和平程序会给美国带进五百万至二千万个工作岗位。哪一个叁议院的成员要反对它？<br>而且我们会看见，在数天之内，有和犹他人相同的人被到联邦调查局：以及反对伊朗和平进程的叁议院头头的辞职。<br>因为它是有意义的。政客了解这。当你审查这些图，对你，我在一个月内节省了＄198, $150，但是政客看到这国家的计算图！他会被打动的。<br>There is where your job is across the world to show your governments:<br>We are saving it for ourselves. We don’t want to kill anymore.<br>你展示给你的政府你的工作可穿越在世界各地：<br>，我们正在为自己解救它。我们不想再要杀戮。<br>Killing has brought us nothing else. Wars and armies have brought us nothing else. When we opened the Eastern Block in Europe, we saw all the borders been down, all the soldiers and armies of Germany, France, Britain, Eastern Block, Czechoslovakia, …<br>They all disappeared. Everybody said: “What are we going to do with these soldiers?”<br>Where are the soldiers? They all got employed in another industry in another way.<br>Do we need armies to spend to kill?<br>No. Because, with this, at least we can start a new process.<br>This way, everybody is equal.<br>Japan can’t be more ahead than China and China can’t be more ahead of United States or Africa. Because Africans are ahead of you. We’ve seen that with Benjamin last week.<br>杀戮不再会带给我们任何事。战争和军队也不会带给我们任何事。当我们再看欧洲东部区域，我们顺着边缘看下去，德国、法国的所有军人和军队、还有英国，东部地区，捷克的，…<br>他们全部消失了。每个人都说：”我们要这些军人做什么？”<br>军人在哪里？他们全部在另外一种方法中的工业中得到了雇用。<br>我们需要花费在军队上去杀戮吗？<br>不，因为和这技术一起，至少，我们能开始一个新进程。<br>这样，每个人都是相等的。<br>日本不能比中国更超前并且中国不能比美国或非洲更超前。因为非洲人已经在你之前。我们上星期已经和本杰民看到这些！。<br>So, we have become One Nation. We have become One Planet, and we care about our race as a human race in the space. And that’s where we are going.<br>You put this figure into 1.5 billion Chinese.<br>It’s a staggering figure.<br>That’s why we are the guests of head of nations in the next two weeks in China. We respect the Chinese army. They are in full operation because we know it’s the army of people, not the army to kill.<br>They tell me why you are working because I have every respect for China. I have worked with them, across them, across the table for 20 years.<br>Army, Chinese army, is not a military force, it’s a Nation force!<br>And now they see the opportunity. We support them and I translate full technology. I’ve made technologies which is not in pubic, to be handed over as a gift for their move in that direction.<br>因此，我们已经成为一个国家。我们已经成为一个行星，而且我们在空间关心的是一个作为一个人类的一个种族。那是我们要去的方向。<br>你把这一个图放给十五亿的中国人。<br>它就是一个难以置信的图。<br>那就是为什么我们在往后两个星期内做客的头一个国家是中国，我们尊敬中国军队。因为我们知道它是人们的军队而不是去杀戮的军队，所以他们全部被划入的运作之中。<br>他们告诉了我是为什么在工作，因为我对中国有所有的敬意，我已经通过他们，通过那桌子与他们合作，有 20 年之久。<br>中国军队，不是一个军事上的军队，它是一个国家力量！<br>而且现在他们见到机会。我们支援他们，而且我传送给他们全部的技术。我作的技术不是见不得人的，它将被当做一个有正确方向性礼物的被移交给他们。<br>01:15:00<br>The same as you see （here）. You multiply that 200 million.. people in the United States.. the saving is no different in China and the rest. They all are human They need the heating and electricity but multiply that 200 million by 5.<br>You see how the figure changes on the other end. You see the savings for the Chinese government as a major oil importer, fuel importer. You see where we are going.<br>And now slowly, slowly we can show the benefits of the technol y.<br>I took patience. I took a lot of rough time. I withstood four murder attempts by “Red Circle”.<br>Poisoning my child and my wife. But we have seen it is worth it.<br>How many other scientists have been killed to be able to get to the position we are?<br>We do not know how many “Red Circle” has put to death or how many of their children has raped in front of their eyes to get what he wants.<br>The white hair has a lot of black heart.<br>How many German children had to pay?<br>同样你看［在这里］.你乘那个二亿。。在美国的人们，它的储蓄与中国和其它国家没有不同。他们全部是需要热和电力，但是用 5 乘那二亿的人。<br>你会从图上见到如何在另一方面上的改变。你见到作为一个主要的石油进口国，燃料输入者。中国政府的储蓄，你会在慢慢地，慢慢地见到它这个技术会有什么样的好处。<br>我有耐性。我花了许多艰苦的时间。我 经历了 四个被 “ 红圈会” 策划的谋杀.<br>我的孩子和我的妻子中过毒。但是我们已经见到它是值得的。<br>许多其他能够到达我们的位置的科学家是如何被杀的？<br>我们不知道多少人被” 红圈会” 处死了或者有多少人们的孩子从他们的眼前掠走，从而他从人们那里拿他们想要的。<br>那个白色头发的人心有多黑。<br>多少德国孩子不得不被付出了？<br>Now you put this into the hands of Germany.<br>The German Chancellor understood this years ago. We received a 500 million back up from the German Chancellor for transforming the Belgian car industry in Antwerp from General Motors to take the technology back into Germany. That they could do it.<br>And amazing enough who was present?  “Red Circle”.  Everything went.<br>German government … take this to them … They support you …<br>Your Chancellor knows about Keshe technology fully.  She understood it years ago.<br>But so much rubbish was put in by “Red Circle”. And the negativity publicity.<br>Now we got their man and now we get their king<br>Germany needs this technology like water. Your nation is solid, is perfect. German engineering is  undoubtedly the best perfect  technology in the world. They are the best people I have been brought up amongst  German technology with Siemens and Philips. You have the best scientists, engineers on your land. Now share it with the rest of the world. We have given you the time and I have put a lot of effort into German Keshe Foundation manufacturing first thing. I have not done that with any of the others because I know we are supported fully within the German government. We were supported a long time ago<br>现在你被交入德国人的手中。<br>德国总理今年前有了了解。我们从德国总理收到了五亿去把在安特卫普的通用汽车的比利时汽车业的技术拿回到德国。他们办得到。<br>令人惊异的是拿谁作礼物？”红圈会” .所有的事都过去了。<br>德国政府……拿这给他们……他们支持你……<br>你的总理完全知道 Keshe 技术。她数年前了解了它。<br>但是这么多垃圾被 “ 红色圆周 “ 带进来.而且是否定性消息。<br>现在我们争取他们的主人，而且现在我们争取到他们的国王<br>德国像需要水一样需要这技术。你的国家是坚固的，是完美的。德国工程学毫无疑问地是世界上最好的完美技术。他们是那些最好的人们，我在德国技术当中的西门子和飞利浦公司中成长起来。你有最好的科学家和工程师。现在和世界的其它地方分享它吧。我们已经给你时间，而且我做了许多努力把第一重要的事放在德国 Keshe 基金会制造业上。因为我知道我们在德国政府里面完全被支援，所以我还没有对其它国家中的任何一个这样做过。我们很久以前被他们支持了<br>But negative information through “Red Circle”, because you do not understand.<br>One thing you have never understood.<br>They said to them all the time: “Our man is sitting next to him. He is not worth it. He is all wrong”. Because the man was sitting next to me, they could believe them!<br>Now our man is all of you sitting with your governments. And the “Red Circle” on the run.<br>So please understand what the change is going to come. This is one house. We are not overshooting.<br>Five companies are signed. They come into production in the next few weeks in the United States. Support them!<br>This is for you!<br>American jobs. American support  American workforce. American savings. But make sure your government understands.<br>With this time around no more wars.<br>但是否定信息从 “ 红圈会 “来了, 因为你不了解。<br>有一件事物你从来不懂的的。<br>他们一直对他们说：”我们的人紧挨着你坐着的。你不是配的。你所有的都是错误的”.因为那个人紧邻他坐下，所以他会相信他们！<br>现在你们全部是我们的人，和政府一起。所以 “ 红圈会 “ 逃跑了。<br>因此请了解将要来的变化。这里只是一楝房子。我们一点没有夸张。<br>五家公司已签名了。他们在美国的往后几星期内就投入生产。支持他们！<br>这是为了你们！<br>美国的工作。支持的是美国和美国劳动力，美国储蓄。但是确定你的政府了解这些。<br>这样周围再不会任何的战争。<br>We handle the Rothschilds. We are strong enough.<br>We will handle Illuminaties. We are strong enough.<br>We make sense to them to see they don’t lose anything. But they have to understand:<br>It is the time for change!<br>Accommodate yourself somewhere else.<br>We are vetting everyone  that no,  none of these extreme conditions comes into the Keshe Foundation. No organization is doing what the Keshe Foundation is doing.  We have brought KBG into operation with us. We have brought CIA with us. We talk to Mossad. We talk to Iranian National Security. We talk to the Chinese Security. We talk to everyone openly. It has become the platform for national securities because they trust.<br>Because this time as a nation we need to secure the whole of humanity, not just a few!<br>我们操控着 Rothschilds公司 。我们足够强大。<br>我们将会控制 Illuminaties 公司。我们足够强大。<br>我们让他们知道他们不会失去任何东西。但是他们必须懂得这些：<br>现在是改变的时间！<br>你自己要在各个方面学会适应。<br>我们正在审核每个人，不会有一个极端情况进入 Keshe 基金会。没有组织是在做 Keshe 基金会在做的。我们已经把KBG 带进操作中。我们已经CIA一起。我们和摩萨德组织对话。我们和伊朗国家安全局说话。我们和中国安全局说话。我们公开地和每个人说话。因为他们的信任，它已经成为国际安全的平台。<br>因为这次，作为一个国家，我们的要保障全部人类，而不是仅仅一小部分人！<br>The figures are there. Publish it. Don’t speculate. Exact figures:  25% in one month for the neighbour. That neighbour now has more to put food on the tables for the children.<br>Putting food on the children increases the work force in United States to produce more food. In producing more food you create more jobs in the country for other industries. You feed each other, but the figures are staggering when they start coming in. In the next six months, you will see the figures. When the first Keshe Foundation Magrav Units, Universal Feeding Units hit the market in the United States maybe in the next 2 months, then you’ll understand what is going to be.<br>My biggest problem is “can we meet the demand?”. This is why we are going to China to ask the Chinese Government to support any short fall so that we all go together: Africans, Americans, Chinese, Indians, we all move this time together so that we bring the changes.<br>The King wanted for arrest and “Sousan”<br>图表在这里。不假思索地公开它。这是精确的图表：一个月内在邻居里的 25%会有更多的食物放在孩子的桌上。让孩子们的增长的食物。<br>美国的劳动人口可生产更多的食物。在产生更多的食物时你国家工业就有更多的其它的工作岗位。你们彼此供养。但是当他们开始加入这些时，这个数椐是令人震惊的。在往后的六个月内，你将会见到这数椐。当第一个 Keshe 基金会 Magrav 单元，食品单元进入美国的市场2个月内，当时你将会了解将要发生什么。<br>我最大的问题是”我们能满足需求吗？”.这是为什么我们正要去中国要求中国政府来弥补任何的不足，最终让我们成为整体：不论非洲人、美国人、华人，印第安人，我们全部这次一起前进，我们一起去变化。<br>那个国王曾想逮捕和 “ Sousan” </p>
<p>第四部分<br>01:21:00<br>Now we know the smallest nation in the world （Belgium） what the mayhem has created for everyone they are gone, they are finished.<br>We have requested for in our warranty we can publish it as we’ve done before for the warrant for arrest of the King, ex-King and the head of the European Space Agency Directorship.<br>现在我们知道了世界上最小的国家—比利时，对每个人都罪行累累。 我们已经申请了对比利时现任国王、比利时前任前国王及欧洲太空总署的局长的逮捕令。<br>We are very open. It’s sitting in the European Court of Justice working very closely with Italian securities, the French are in it, the Americans have moved into it. Soon we will see. And this is not a new document. He’s been sitting there for two years, now it’s going to be speeded up because now we’ve captured their man in Utah, they know how they received so much false informations from the guy who was supposed to telling them “I am sitting next to him, it’s all false”.<br>逮捕令是由紧邻意大利证券的欧洲法院起草，法国人和美国人也已经参与进来了。逮捕令很快就会被发布，让我们拭目以待。对他的调查早两年前就开始了，而且我们在犹他州把他抓了个现行，这会大大加快对他的审判。他用愚蠢的计俩发布虚假信息诋毁凯史基金会，制造混乱等所有的事情都会被公布于众。<br>Now you know why he’s called the “Red Circle”, and how the misinformation was given credence.<br>Because “I am next to him. He’s nothing, he is just wasting your time.”<br>And then going to across the Utah to create mayhem now we see how （it） comes:<br>现在你明白了他为什么被称为“红圈”，以及他又是如何用虚假信息误导别人的。<br>没有人比我更了解他，他就是一个浪费时间的人渣。<br>他试图在犹他州创造混乱，现在我们看看他使如何实施这些小计俩的：<br>“Sousan” comes into the victim list of the Keshe Foundation. Who put it there?<br> （She would answer:） “My friend. We share children now, we share a website.”<br>A person I’ve never met in my life now has become my victim. So you see how.<br>Because “The ‘Rred Circle’ says so and that gives us credence”.<br>很明显“sousan”黑入凯史基金会并捏造了一份受害者名单。<br>就这样在“sousan”制造的谎言中，我素未谋面的人变成了我的受害者。<br>而“红圈”则会继续造谣用谎言去恶心人们。<br>They are supporting each other, Pedophiles have worked very well together. Now we have unfettered their main station.<br>他们和恋童癖者一起合作攻击凯史基金会，现在我们已经把他们一网打尽了。</p>
<p>But don’t forget she claims to be Iran National. We are negotiating with Iranian Government, she will be judged in the Iranian Court. It’s very beautiful because we are one nation, you go back to the origin of your blood for your judgement. Very very interesting. Very interesting what is coming up, the governments as ONE nation accept the responsibility of their own people’s behaviour in their own country and the ones which don’t do go to the place where the claim is set.<br>别忘了她自称是一名伊朗人，通过我们与伊朗政府的沟通，不久她会由伊朗政府审判。作为“one nation”的国家政府有责任承担并审判自己的人民在其他国家犯下的罪行。</p>
<p>So, we are doing all of us right, we become one family, we are working as one, we see in the figures here, there are hundreds of figures across internet. People are proud to save money that they can feed their children.<br>They are not afraid that they are going to get attacked with their children, （by being asked） “Can I have the pictures of your daughter?”<br>我们组成了同一个大家庭，世界上每一个人都是家庭的一员。人们将会为享受富足而自豪。<br>他们不会因为自己的孩子被袭击变得怯懦，（被问到）有关Sousan”“我能看一下你女儿的照片吗？”的事情。<br>Vince, sorry, Rick, can you put that up please? You stay on the force of it (1:23:45).<br>You have a communication to the Keshe Foundation which was sent to you where “Sousan” asks for the picture of the daughter.<br>That people know how correct we are, now Interpol is running to us. Do you have it with you please?<br>文斯，对不起，瑞克，你能把“Sousan”的通讯记录放到屏幕上吗？<br>（1:23:45）。<br>凯史基金会有“sousan”向人们索要他们子女照片的通讯记录。<br>人们知道我们是正确的，现在国际刑警组织正帮助向我们。瑞克，找到了吗？</p>
<p>Rick : Yeah, I am not sure where that is actually it’s, huh… maybe it was sent by messenger, hum… did Carolina send me that or somebody else?<br>瑞克：还没有找到呢……也许有人送来的……是不是Carolina误送给别人了？</p>
<p>M.T. Keshe : Yes, Caroline has sent it to you. You said you have it. She will send it to you again, just wait one second. Then you will see how “Sousan” is operating with the “False Hope”.<br>凯史：没有发错啊， Carolina已经发给你了，而且你说收到了。等一下啊，我让Carolina再重新发给你。你会看到“sousan”是如何经营“虚假的希望”的。</p>
<p>And we don’t say anything. It’s the writing of one of the Keshe Foundation members who’s been supporting “False Hope” and put in touch, in touch with “Sousan”.<br>We call it “Sousan”, it means a “Needle”, ja? And you will see there in the writing that she’s asked for a child’s picture.<br>Because we have to do it and then you understand that’s exactly the same as the guy who pisses in the garden in front of the child. It’s criminal in every sense in every nation of the world except in Belgium.<br>这是一个曾经资助过“sousan”的Keshe基金会的成员和“sousan”的聊天记录，他自己也是在毫不知情的情况下被“sousan”欺骗。<br> “sousan”就像一只“针”无孔不入，在这这个记录里你会看到她索要一个孩子的照片。<br>我们必须这样做，他们在花园里当着孩子随地小便，简直就是流氓。除了比利时，在世界每个国家都将其行为视为犯罪。</p>
<p>01:25:00<br>There is a question here. Please do not put any name anywhere.<br>We do not want anything on our websites or in the chats. Delete everything. We do not use names because we all know who they are.<br>他们不需要在我们的网站上或者聊天室里留下他们的大名，因为我们知道他们是谁。</p>
<p>We’re trying to find … Have you found it, Carolina?<br>We are going to send it to you, we are going to present it to you, Rick has it. I especially did this.<br>我们正在努力寻找……Carolina，你找到了吗？<br>Carolina：我们确实发送给瑞克了，现在再给瑞克发一遍。</p>
<p>Because we knew sooner or later we will receive the OK from CIA and the security services to go open with it. Because this time we got the gentleman in Utah. Services are running very, very fast.<br>凯史：我们知道中央情报局和安全部门会很快地调查完毕整件事，因为这个时候我们在犹他州抓住了这个名叫“红圈”的倒霉蛋。</p>
<p>We ask the Kingdom of Morocco to help us to bring these people into justice. They are Moroccan born, they have to go back to Morocco for sentencing.<br>The attorney of the King of Morocco knows exactly what to do.<br>他们在摩洛哥出生，将会被引渡回去接收正义的审判。在我们的要求下，摩洛哥国王的律师很清楚该怎么做。</p>
<p>You got it?<br>Ahm … Rick, Carolina is sending it to you the way we received it. This was sent to us. When we announced this last Tuesday or last Thursday in respect to the “Red Circle”, people started flooding us with a lot of information about these people.<br>Have you sent it?   (We hear Carolina in the background saying: “Yes”)<br>Is on which one?<br>On the messengers … yes … ok, and, read it, this is not from us.<br>瑞克，你收到了吗？<br>……瑞克，Carolina已经发给你了。他也寄给我们一份。那是上星期二或上星期四我们在讨论“红圈”时，人们发送给我们很多有关的信息。<br>Carolina，你发给瑞克了吗？（背景中Carolina：“我发给瑞克了”）<br>瑞克：是在哪个里面呢？<br>哦，在收件箱里……是的……好吧我们真的没收到。</p>
<p>We are receiving a lot of communication. People, scientists are asking. We make a correction, I made a mistake last time:<br>You send … if you are a scientist or somebody who has evidence regarding these people … send it to:<br>上个星期许多人和科学家们都在询问有关“红圈”的事情。当时因为人们发送的信息量太大，我就让他们发送到一个指定的邮箱，结果我把邮箱弄错了：<br>“如果你是一位科学家或是某个持有证据的人，请将你掌握的证据发送至以下邮箱”：<br><a href="mailto:security@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@keshefoundation.org</a></p>
<p>All the things you sent us automatically through our … CIA will go back to the people who are work with us and amongst us to see it through we come back to you once we check your credibility is not allegation.<br>所有发送给我们的邮件都会自动地通过我们的……为了查出混在凯史基金会中的内鬼，所有凯史基金会的工作人员以及与凯史基金会有联系的人会被中央情报局会调查。</p>
<p>Have you received it, Rick?<br>瑞克，收到了吗？</p>
<p>Rick: I think so, I’m not sure ??? see i’d copy it ???<br>瑞克：还不知道呢，我看看啊。</p>
<p>K: It starts with “I want to puke!”<br>凯史：标题是“我要吐了！”</p>
<p>Rick: “I want to puke” … yes, right I’m here …<br>瑞克：“我要吐了！”……哦，看到了，在这里……</p>
<p>K: This is from the father which “Sousan” asked for the picture of his daughter. They realized suddenly what they were getting pulled into.<br>Can you put it up and read it, please.<br>凯史：这是一位父亲发给我们的内容是“sousan”索要他女儿的照片。他们突然意识到这是一个陷阱。<br>瑞克你能把这封邮件放到桌面上给大家读一读吗？</p>
<p>Rick: Ja, i’m just to get it recopied so i don’t have it inside my … on my desktop and so on.<br>瑞克：好的，不过等一下啊，我要把它复制到桌面上……</p>
<p>K: Ok, so what it is, please:<br>You see these kind of things we become vigilant to it and now because we manage to get the top man all the security forces are looking for their children.<br>And they are protecting them. And this is one which is come to us, then it’s gonna straight away to the securities.<br>Can you read it, please?<br> 凯史：我们不得不对这些事警觉起来，所有的安全部门都正在帮助人们寻找他们失踪的孩子。<br>你能给大家读一下这封邮件吗？</p>
<p>Rick: Ok, it says:<br>瑞克：好的，我给大家读一下：</p>
<p>“The actions makes me puke. You know…. I funded too with some money sousan and i was in touch with her for some time if you remember the episode  in which i ask even to Sandor why he wasn’t proceeding in sending her the documentation to come here.<br>我快要吐了……我曾经资助过sousan一些钱并且和她联系过一段时间，我甚至还要Sandor帮她办理出入境手续。</p>
<p>I wasn’t able to detect her aim. But there was one thing that sounded VERY strange to me and now i connect with this you are saying. I remember that one time we were talking here on fb she asked me to send her a picture of my daughter and that made me feel a VERY UNCOMFORTABLE sensation. Luckily i didn’t pass to her anything and because she hasn’t insisted on this anymore i passed through, but now with this i understand better. Thanks”<br>我没有察觉到她的目的。今天在听您说起有关事情的情况后我突然想起一件很奇怪的事，记得有一次和sousan在Face Book上聊天，她想让我送她一张我的女儿的照片，这让我感到很不舒服。幸运的是，她没有继续坚持所以我没有给她任何东西。现在我终于光然大悟了。谢谢凯史先生。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe: Now you see two things about “Sousan” and that is:<br>We said to you that she was funded by the Keshefoundation supporters and she says she has to use her pension money. Now you see how devious these people are.<br>凯史：两件事联系到一起都涉及到“sousan”这个人：凯史基金会也资助了她许多钱，她还说这是她将来的养老钱。可是你看到的这些人是多么丑恶啊！</p>
<p>Rick: Ja, I even sent her money as well, so …<br>瑞克：哎呦，我当初也捐钱给她了……</p>
<p>01:30:00<br>Mr. Keshe: So now you see: We pay and they play such a “pity me”, that we pay them to abuse our own children. Now you understand what’s going on, it’s in black and white.<br>凯史：现在你明白了：我们为他们付出，而他们一直在装可怜；我们资助他们，他们却虐待我们的孩子。<br> （Another speaker says:）<br>She fooled pretty much many people, Mr. Keshe, because she contacted me at that time through Skye and started crying and said “You know, why is Carolina treating me like this? I cannot take my dog with me, even though it’s through Seripito?, whatever, and I told her “Listen, maybe you should get in touch, you know, directly, I had no clue at that time…”.<br>另一个人说：Keshe先生，她骗了很多很多人。那时她通过Skye向我哭诉说：“为什么Carolina要这样对我？现在我甚至都不能和我的狗在一起了……”后来，我跟她说：“听着，也许你应该向大家解释……”</p>
<p>(Keshe) No, she forced Carolina very heavy to bring the dog, because the dog is a psychological dog, and they get the children to get interested in the dog and then through the dog they kidnap the children. This is how the 5 year old child was kidnapped in the Spain and ended up in Belgium through Morocco.<br>凯史：不是这样的，是她硬逼着Carolina带那只狗狗，那只狗狗是一个心理诱饵，孩子们喜欢狗狗，所以他们用狗狗吸引并绑架孩子。有一个5岁的孩子西班牙在被绑架，夹道摩洛哥最后被绑到比利时。</p>
<p>Interpol has had a full phase （or face?）. This lady is one of the biggest criminals known at the moment. FBI is right on top of her. The same officers who went for Utah are into this because the evidence is very heavy. If she asks any of you for a picture of your children, please send it to <a href="mailto:Security@Keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Security@Keshefoundation.org</a> . We send it straight away to the FBI.<br>对这个案件国际刑警组织有一个完整的计划。这位女士“Sousan”是目前已知的最大的罪犯之一，联邦调查局正在调查她，并且在犹他州发现了极其重要的证据。如果她曾经问你要过孩子照片，那么请把相关信息发送到<a href="mailto:security@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security@keshefoundation.org</a>这个邮箱里。我们会直接发给联邦调查局</p>
<p>This “Sousan” and what do you call it, “False Hope”, are part of the same structure of the gentlemen in Utah because his name is connected on their Facebook to each other and well supported. You saw how “Red Circle” went immediately to the help of the guy in Utah, immediately after we’ve drawn my logo, and now immediately he brought her and put as one of the victims.<br>Now we see how they operate. They are all over connected.<br> 不管“sousan”还是“虚假的希望”都是在犹他州犯罪组织的一部分，他们是通过Facebook相互联系的。在凯史基金会注册官方商标后，“红圈”立刻赶到犹他州制造混乱，现在他们又伪装成一个个受害者。<br>现在我们看看这个犯罪集团是如何运作的。他们彼此之间都是连系的。</p>
<p>The top man controlling everything sits in Antwerp.<br>然而操纵这一切的幕后黑手仍然在安特卫普。</p>
<p>Please go to the address in Antwerp and ask for your children back.<br>We give you so much evidence that these people will go for run. We have filed, we have evidence enough in writing of the man when he confesses himself that “yes, I pissed and I write a song about it”…<br>And, to do everything else they call us also some names.<br>We were called ‘Cuckoos’ because we didn’t see.<br>我给大家展示了如此多的证据，这些证据足以让这些有罪行的人闻风丧胆四处躲藏。我们已经把这些证据归类整理，我们还有在邮件中这个人承认自己犯下的罪行：我在你家花园对着你的小孩裸露小便的事，我还编了首歌… 还有做其他的罪行的时候，他们还给我们起了不同的名字。我们被叫做“布谷鸟”，因为我们没被人发现。（布谷鸟就是很少见到鸟，但很容易在森林里听到布谷鸟的叫声。）</p>
<p>Now, we are very intelligent people. Now you understand. Even the internet companies which were supporting you will go on the huge claim for them operating pedophile cases.<br>Because now they are using these to attract more pedophiles. It’s the new name. If you go on any site which “Red Circle” writing, your IP is gone, your children are for the bite for “Sousan”.<br>现在即使一个小小的互联网公司都会强烈支持你继续为恋童癖案件索要巨额赔偿。<br>现在他们利用这些来吸引更多的恋童癖者。如果你去网站上浏览任何“红圈”的文章，你的IP地址就会被他们找到，你的孩子就会被“sousan”盯上。</p>
<p>So, please be careful. This is important. Please understand what is going on.<br>一定要小心，这是非常重要的。</p>
<p>Can we get deleted of this? I’m ashamed to put this on the website, but we know it is, is a normal “Sousan”, it’s everyone, and we don’t accuse anybody, but we all know how the videos have come in.<br>我们可以把这个删除了吗？把这个放在网上我都觉得羞愧，虽然她只是一个很普通的“sousan”，我们不能指责任何人。</p>
<p>So, what we go back on is, … Can you take it off please in sharing, Rick, people have seen enough of it. Shame on these people.<br>瑞克，你把它从屏幕上拿下来分享吧，人们已经看够了。真为这些人感到耻辱。</p>
<p>And the biggest shame is, they call themselves “Iranian”. Iranians love and adore children.<br>最大的耻辱就是他们声称自己是伊朗人。他们侮辱了所有的善良的伊朗人。伊朗人是不会对孩子做出这种事的。</p>
<p>These are not! She doesn’t even carry an Iranian name. Shame. But, the most important thing is on her application into the foundation, she has written that she works for National Securities.<br>她甚至连一个伊朗的名字都没有。真是不知羞耻。而且在她向基金会递交的申请书上写自己在国家安全部工作。</p>
<p>And now National Securities are checking which National Security she is spying from.<br>If it’s with the “Red Circle”, it ties up with a lot of children gone missing.<br>现在国家安全部正在调查她是否在同时监视国家安全局。<br> “红圆”与大量的儿童的失踪密切相关。</p>
<p>I told you. When we go clean with each other, openly, they are on the run.<br>Now they are on the run.<br>我们公开地调查使他们都在慌忙地逃跑。<br>现在他们抱头逃窜。</p>
<p>Universal Feeding System<br>宇宙能量供给系统<br>01:33:48<br>What is important is the fact that now we see the technology is paying off.<br>The technology which you supported.<br>Now is bringing the fruit for all of us.<br>现在我们看到的是等离子体科技正在给人类带来繁荣和富足。</p>
<p>When I explained this technology years ago, one of the top Ambassadors in the world he said to me:<br>“Mehran, there is not enough money in the banks to pay for this technology.”<br>And you see why: One nation saves Trillions.<br>几年前当我解释这一技术的时候， 一名世界高级的大使对我说：<br> “麦赫兰特，银行里没有足够的钱来研究开发这项技术。”<br>可是这样的技术可以为一个国家节省上万亿美元。</p>
<p>You usually paid 10 times the interest what you create.<br>There is not enough money in the banks of the United States to pay me and you lot for what we have given them as a gift.<br>We developed it together. We carry on developing together and in the coming time, we all go to Space together.<br>你通常要花费10倍的资金才能获得想要的成果。<br>美国没有足够的钱支持我开发这项技术，现在反过头来我们把这项技术当作礼物送给美国。<br>我们一起发展，在未来一起迈向太空。</p>
<p>But, we have to teach. We have to bring enough that we carry enough that we can go to the next steps.<br>目前我们必须开展教学教会大家，那时才可以进行下一步。</p>
<p>Now, we carry China, we carry the United States, we carry Africa, we carry Australia, we carry South America, as one family, we are all working together.<br>现在我们携手中国，美国，非洲，澳大利亚共同构建一个大家庭，一起工作。</p>
<p>Let us change the course of the man to a peaceful man then we open the door of the space.<br>让我们一起踏上和平的道路，共同打开通向宇宙的大门。</p>
<p>In the teaching on Tuesday, we have gone further as we explain to you, Jackie explained to you how we have developed the technology with collaboration of a number of people in the Keshe Foundation and Innovation and Space Center to develop a new Food System.<br>在星期二的教学，Jackie为大家讲解，在Keshe基金会和太空中心的共同合作下开发了一种新的食品系统。</p>
<p>Now you’ve seen how these Magrav systems have helped in reducing the power because they create their own power and it’s a gradual increase.<br>你已经看到magrav系统在使用过程中可以减少能源的消耗，因为magrav系统可以自己创造能量，这是一个渐进增加能量的过程。</p>
<p>Now we learn together the next step. What we’ve done, what we call the Universal Feeding System, if like people like Robert who made 10 or 12 different Magrav systems, …<br>Place your Magrav system in such a position.<br>These are each one one stacker<br>现在要进行下一步。制作宇宙能量供给系统，像Robert做了10–12个不同的magrav系统……<br>这样放置你的magrav系统。<br>这些都是一个一个的堆叠系统。</p>
<p>One stacker to us is three layers.<br>Three coils, gravitational, magnetic field.<br>一个堆叠系统包含3层即3套斥引力线圈。</p>
<p>We put only three stackers, not four, in this position.<br>在这个位置仅仅放置3个堆叠系统就行了。</p>
<p>We put three stackers, not four, in here:<br>在这个位置上也放置3个堆叠系统。</p>
<p>We put three stackers, not four, in here:<br>然后在这个位置上再放置3个堆叠系统。</p>
<p>So, now you have three three-stackers. （ = 9 one-stackers = 9 x 3-layered one-stackers ）<br>现在你有了一个3 X 3个3层的堆叠系统。<br>You have two choices now:<br>You can add a fourth one to make it the Star Formation, …<br>你有两个选择：<br>你可以再增加第四套（每个系统系统3个堆叠系统）组成一个形体结构……</p>
<p>Or, you can leave it as three.<br>But, now, out of the three, don’t forget, this is your base （of the） Star Formation.<br>或者不增加，还是3套系统。（一套系统包含3个堆叠系统）<br>要记住，如果不增加第四套系统的话，现在的排列状况只是形体结构的底座。</p>
<p>Now, you need one on the top which is the fourth.<br>现在，你需要顶部放置第四个。</p>
<p>But, you have to look and educate yourself to the next level of understanding.<br>We had to put it on the top because of our mentality it has to be.<br>你要通过学习了解下一个层次的知识。<br>我们必须把它放在顶部，因为我们的心智必须要……</p>
<p>But, if you look at this, … the fourth can be anywhere!<br>In a way, if i make it green you understand it better.<br>The fourth can be anywhere.<br>其实第四套可以放置在任何地方！<br>我把它标记成绿色你们就能明白了。<br>第四套可以放在任何地方。</p>
<p>Because all the system needs to do is to reposition itself in respect to the fourth.<br>因为所有的系统都需要重新定位自己以便连接到第四套系统。</p>
<p>You can move the fourth back and forth in every direction, but because the link is established, it’s always in touch with it.<br>可以在不同的方向来回移动第四套系统，因为彼此之间已经成功建立链接了，所以无论你如何移动第四套系统，它们彼此仍然相互连接。</p>
<p>And the fourth is your brain, is the body of the man.<br>第四套系统相当于人的大脑，剩下的3套好似人的身体。</p>
<p>The fourth is the existence of the true and in a way it’s you.<br>All they need to do is to share there, …  to adjust themselves that way:<br>就某种意义来讲第四套系统就是你。<br>他们需要做的是调整自己的方式：</p>
<p>If you are there, …. to adjust themselves this way.<br>如果……以这种方式调整自己。</p>
<p>But in fact the energy doesn’t change!<br>And this is you. You are at home near your set, you are here in Washington, but because you connected it to your system in Zurich, it’s still in connection, you receive.<br>事实上能量并没有改变！<br>如果你在家里，系统在附近，你与系统之间可以建立连接；如果你在华盛顿，系统在苏黎世那你们之间也仍然可以建立连接。</p>
<p>So, now you understand the new structure of connection with your system, but the beauty with this is, now you get collection of, …<br>现在你明白了用这种新的结构连接系统，但精彩之处在于，你可以收集……</p>
<p>You have to understand what this is.<br>你必须要明白这是什么。</p>
<p>Let’s say we use four.<br>我们使用了4套系统。</p>
<p>You have four in 3, 3, 3 combination. Yes?<br>在3-3-3构成底座的基础上增加了第四套系统。</p>
<p>Here you have again the same.<br>这里也一样。</p>
<p>You have to understand the fourth one is the interaction of … creation of your own free energy.<br>你要明白第四套系统产生一个相互作用的……创造出自由能源。</p>
<p>So you always get four.<br>所以要增加第四套系统。</p>
<p>But, you have four times that, …<br>但有时增加第四套系统……<br>so you go four times the stacker unit here, you understand, so you can see the combination here （on the right）, … the combination here （the above one）, … the combination here （on the left）.<br>这个结构由四套系统构成，这里你可以看到彼此结合（右边）……然后在这里彼此结合（上面）……在这里彼此结合（左边）。</p>
<p>And then they create a combination each one with each one.<br>You more or less cover the full spectrum of the energy gravitational-magnetic field from Hydrogen, to Orange Juice, to Plutonium, to Uranium and the amount you need.<br>他们彼此相互结合。<br>你几乎能覆盖从氢到橙汁、钚、铀一直到所有能量的引力磁场光谱。</p>
<p>So by setting up this structure, you have created a copy of every element which could be in energy level to man.<br>通过建立这个结构，在人类能量层次你就可以复制出每一个元素。<br>Remark from the transcribers:<br>This schema here is added for illustration purposes only.<br>Somebody posted it on the internet, but it is a very good illustration of that what Mr. Keshe talked about.<br>誊写员：<br>此模式是为了更好地阐述。<br>有个人就凯史先生所讲的在网上发表了一篇文章，这更加明确的阐述了凯史先生的理论知识。</p>
<p>The schema on left does not reflect exactly, what Mr. Keshe explained at last.<br>Mr. Keshe talked about 3 complete star-formations, right?<br>We see 3 groups of  3 one-stackers here on the left, there is one stacker per group missing to build 3 star-formations, right?<br>左边的开模式并不能很好地阐述最后凯史先生讲的。<br>凯史先生讲到了3个完整的星体组合，对吧？<br>我们看到左边用了3个单层线圈系统构成了一个只有底座的星体组合。</p>
<p>It should look like the right picture, but at the moment we do not know how to connect them correctly.<br>It’s just for illustration purposes, ok? ）<br>但我们不知道如何才能正确地连接成右图那样。<br>这只是为了能更好的向大家讲解凯史先生的教学好吧？</p>
<p>01:40:00<br>Are there any mathematicians behind us? Do we have any mathematicians or any of us can do a quick mathematical simulation for us to give us such a combination.<br>And don’t forget, each stacker of three which is in it,  itself, it has three coils, and don’t forget each coil has a gravitational-magnetical, too.<br>（Mr. Keshe wipes out the whiteboard）<br>有没有数学家在场？现场有没有数学家或精通数学的人能帮我们快速建立一个能表示这种组合的数学模型。<br>3个能量单元构成一组系统，每个能量单元包含三个线圈，每个线圈都产生一个磁引力场。<br>（Keshe先生擦了白板）</p>
<p>So, if I can just take this off and make a new one, you see what you have. You have, we go from the bottom up: You have two coils in each set and each coil has it’s own, … well actually, … it goes to the power than this, … You have, … let’s do it, … is there anyone mathematician? I’ve never been good in math.<br>（Mr. Keshe wipes out the whiteboard again）<br>我拿一个新的来替换它，一会你就明白了。从下向上看：每个装置包含2个线圈，每个线圈有自己的……现场有没有数学家帮帮我呢，我数学很菜啊。<br>（Keshe先生又擦了白板）</p>
<p>You have two coils, each coil has two pieces, and then you have to understand that you have two coils gravitational and magnetical, and then you have to add, you have 144 in the outer coil and you have 81 x 2 in the inner coil, both gravitational-magnetical, because every loop creates it’s own field strength.<br>（This is the first, in October 2015 introduced basic (flat) coil set）<br>一层线圈包含内外2组线圈（外部一组线圈是144匝，内部一组线圈是81匝），每组线圈由一条引力线圈穿过一条斥力线圈（两条线圈穿套在一起），引力圈是内圈，斥力圈是外圈。每条线圈中的每一匝都能产生场强。<br> （这是2015年10月份第一次介绍基本的线圈设置（两个线圈不是呈90度的交叉））</p>
<p>Now, you have three sets of these … (and then you have three sets of) …  this in one stacker, …<br>现在，你已经有3套……（然后你有3套）……在这个堆叠系统中……</p>
<p>and then you have three stackers in the set, and then you have three plus one, you have four stackers, sorry, in the Star formation, (and then) in each you have four free plasma units energy. If you remember when we made the Star formation, we created free plasma to as multiplication by 4.<br>每个装置包含3个堆叠系统，在这基础上再增加1个堆叠系统，这样4个堆叠系统构成了一个星体组合，换言之每个星体组合包含4个能量单元，通过增加为4个能量单元就可以产生自由等离子体。</p>
<p>Now you have, on top of this, again 3 units of the same.<br>在这之上，还是3个相同的能量单元。</p>
<p>Look at the multiplication of the energies, both gravitational and magnetical, can be, can one of you scientists give us a figure by next week?<br>通过斥引力场产生出了更多的能量，你们其中的一位科学家能在下周提供给我们一些数据吗？</p>
<p>（ Remark from the transcribers:<br> We try to calculate here together:）<br>誊写员：<br>我们正在一起计算呢：）</p>
<p>If you have mathematicians understand the number of the turns in each coil counts, the number of inner core and outer core times 2: Counts!<br>（ 81<em>2 (inner gravitational) + 144</em>2 (outer magnetical) = 450 turns per coil）<br>让我们来计算一下每组线圈总的匝数：</p>
<p>（内部引力圈）81匝×2 + （外部斥力圈）144匝× 2 = 450匝</p>
<p>and then you have the gravitational and magnetic field:Counts!<br>再来计算一下引力场线圈和斥力场线圈的个数。</p>
<p>（ Remark from the transcribers:<br>could this be a factor of 2 ???<br>Or is it to add a 2 ???<br>After winding the coils with all the turns, … after connecting them, there are suddenly two more fields, one gravitational centered around the inner ring and one magnetical centered around the outer ring, right?<br>Is it that what Mr. Keshe means, when he says:<br>“and then you have the gravitational and magnetic field: Counts!” ???<br>誊写员：<br>这是2吗？<br>或者再加一个2？<br>缠好线圈后……连接它们，引力线圈穿过斥力圈作为内圈斥力圈作为外环。<br>当初Keshe先生是这样讲的<br>然后我们来计算一下引力场线圈和斥力场线圈的个数。</p>
<p>It rather looks the part that we have to add instead of multiply by 2 ???<br>This needs further investigation.<br>We don’t know, we’re a bit confused about this point, so we’ll don’t forget this possibility, but at the moment we neither add a 2 or multiply by, ok? ）<br>我们是不是应该加，而不是直接乘2呢？<br>这需要进一步的实验研究。<br>对这一点上我们有点疑惑，但目前我们暂时先不加或者乘呢吧。</p>
<p>then you have three stackers on top of each other: Counts! …<br>    在顶部都有3个堆叠系统，我们来数一数……</p>
<p>（ if 3 coils on top of each other that build a one-stacker is meant, we multiply the turns to<br>  450 (turns per coil) * 3 = 1,350 (turns per one-stacker) ）<br>一个堆叠系统由3层线圈组成。<br>450（单层线圈匝数）×3＝1350（一个堆叠系统的总匝数）</p>
<p>then you have 3 （one-）stacker: Counts!<br>3个堆叠系统有多少匝数呢，继续算。</p>
<p>And then you multiply, give us a figure, what number does it make.<br>然后要乘以一个数。</p>
<p>（ Remark from the transcribers:<br> 3 would be the  base of 1 star-formation, right? So we calculate one star-formation<br>  consisting of 4 instead of 3 one-stackers, ok?<br> If you agree, the number of turns of one star-formation would add up to:<br>1,350 (turns per one-stacker) * 4 = 5,400 (turns per star-formation)<br>誊写员：<br>一个星体组合由3个堆叠系统构成，那我们计算构成一个星体组合所需要的匝数。<br>一个星体组合是由4个堆叠系统构成而不是3个堆叠系统。<br>1350（一个堆叠系统的总匝数）×4＝5400（一个星体组合的总匝数）</p>
<p> and if we use 3 star-formations this adds up to:<br> 5,400 (turns per star-formation) * 3 = 16,200 (turns per feeding-system) ）<br>And this is the number of combinations of the gravitational-magnetic fields, which the system which was so simple you saw with Jackie on Tuesday regarding the feeding, your system produces.<br>那么3个星体组合的总匝数就是：<br>5400（一个星体组合的总匝数）× 3 = 16200（一个宇宙能量供给系统的总匝数）<br>这也就是一个宇宙能量供给系统磁引力场组合的数量，Jackie曾经在周二的教学展示过这个能量供给系统。</p>
<p>That’s why it covers the smell, the sensation, the feeling, the energy, everything. The minute in your brain you think of it because it has a finger print on it or what that strength is and what that food gives you.<br>这个供能系统能制造出包括气味，感觉，能量等等所有的一切。当你的大脑产生需求的一瞬间，宇宙能量供给系统就可以制造出你想要的任何东西。</p>
<p>To you it’s a food, …  to you you ate, …  just say a bag of chips. You go to a chip shop and ask for a bag of chips. To you it’s a chip, but to your brain, everything in that chip is analyzed what it’s going to give…  （technical difficulties）<br>它能提供给你食物……如果你想吃薯片，它就能提供给你薯片。对你的大脑来说，薯片被分析为…… </p>
<p>There is fats, there is salt, there is also some combination of amino acids, different kind of sugar, different kind of fiber, you eat the chip, but your body breaks it up into every piece what it can use it for what and where it can use it.<br>你的身体会从你吃下去的脂肪，盐，氨基酸，各种各样的糖和纤维，还有你吃下去的薯片中摄取所需的能量。</p>
<p>What the smell will give us energy.<br>Because you never understood even the smell is a path of energy you receive.<br>The taste is an energy which you receive and has the strength.<br>气味会带给我们哪些能量呢？<br>你没有意识到通过气味也可以获得能量。<br>通过味道你也可以获得能量。<br>第五部分<br>01:45:00<br>So, now you understand:<br>Your brain, by just putting a single chip in Your mouth, receives a lot of energies in different forms.<br>01:45:07<br>And then, if You look, why do you breath amongst what you’re eating?<br>Because then balances with how much energy needs to go through the emotional side, through the lung that matches with what is received by drinking it or by eating it.<br>（That is what another transcriber has understood. You can hear it by yourself at 01:45:07<br>‘And then, if You look, while You are breathing in between You are eating, the balance it needs to go through the emotional side through the lung  that matter while it is received by drinking it, by eating it’）<br>那么，现在你理解：<br>你的大脑，仅需把一个单晶片放在你嘴里，就可以接收许多不同形式的能量。<br>然后你看，为什么你在进食之间呼吸？因为要平衡多少能量需要通过你情感这边接收——也就是通过肺接收，它要与通过饮用和进食接收的能量相匹配。<br>（这里是转录另一种理解，你自己听听（ 01:45:07……）：<br>“然后你看，当你在进食间隙之间呼吸，需要做到通过感情这边就是肺组织与通过饮用和进食来接收能量之间进行平衡。”）</p>
<p>So, now You understand, the brain, （which） wants to get a chip, knows, this is the amount of energy, it usually receives from a chip.<br>So, when You think about a chip, … （that is） what we showed on Tuesday, that people think of a steak and they receive a steak, … people who wanted a pizza, they got a pizza, … that information receives how much （of） which energy from which circle it needs, because all of those are available in Your system.<br>所以，现在你理解，大脑要给它一个芯片，大量的能量，通常通过芯片接收。<br>那么，当你认为芯片，……那就是周二我们展示的，你想牛排你就收到牛排，你想比萨你就得到比萨，……（取决于）接收的信息量——从哪个循环中接收何种能量的信息，因为在你的系统中，这一切都是可以实现的。</p>
<p>（ Remark from the transcribers:<br>And in fact all of thous are not only in your system … it is all available in the universal space that surrounds and pervades you. As Mr. Keshe from the very beginning always said:<br>The truth is: Litteraly you do not need a system! ）<br>And then thats why you taste and you smell it.<br>01:46:01<br>But don’t forget: You still have forgotten something else in that equation:<br>The GANSes You use. That’s another factor: CuO, Cu2 and the rest of it.<br>（转录讨论：<br>事实上，无数的，不光是在你的系统中……在你周围的遍及一切的宇宙空间中，正如凯史先生一开始就讲过：真相是你不需要一个系统！）<br>那就是为什么你能闻到它你能品尝到它。<br>但是不要忘记：在这个方程式中，你一直忘记还有一些东西，你使用的那些甘斯，还有一些成分：CuO，CO2（原文Cu2？）等等。</p>
<p>So, You see, with the Magrav System, which You use as a universal energy system,  which is the way we use it in space:<br>By （just） thinking, because all the information is already embedded.<br>“This is what the chip gives me” （when） you wanted a chip. You receive everything from Your own system.<br>That´s how the system feeds You and that is why You feel You received it instantaniously!<br>Because magnetic field transfer is instantanious, it does not need digestion.<br>So, in a way, when we spoke with Jackie and we saw, what they said:<br>“I can think of a banana and I receive a banana” - because in Your memory bank of Your inner structure of Your emotions and Your physicality,<br>01:47:07<br>when You say banana, it means You need calcium.<br>所以你清楚，你所用的磁引力系统等同于宇宙能量系统，我们用它进入太空。仅仅通过意念，因为所有的信息都已经嵌入。<br>“这就是给我的芯片”，就是你想要的那个芯片，你接受的全部东西都来自你自己。<br>这就是系统怎样喂养你，就是为什么你立即感觉到你得到它，因为，磁场瞬间传递，它不需要消化。<br>所以，某种程度上，我以前和杰克说过，我们看到他们说：“我能够想香蕉就得到香蕉”，因为在你物理身体和感情的内在结构中，当你说香蕉，你的记忆银行，它解读出你需要钙。</p>
<p>Have You seen how You crave, because if You want to get milk, that means, the emotion tells the physicality, “ I need this calcium and these kind of fats, to be able to run the part which needs it - I am running short.”<br>That is why You crave for it. So, when you think of orange, this is the energy which the orange brings to the body. So, the minute it thinks, those trigger ? light comes in the field in strength, it automatically connects with Your core. So You receive it and the combination is so much that everything is received.<br>Even the taste and odour.<br>Always I tell You: Do not accept it just because it is said! Understand the science behind it!<br>As I always say to my children:<br>If You （just） remember it … （and） in an accident You forget … （then） You can´t!<br>（ Remark from the transcribers:<br>And that is exacly, what happened to all of us: We forgot!<br>And was has to happen: We can’t! ）<br>你感到你多渴望，因为你想得到牛奶，意思是，情感身体告诉物理身体“我需要这种钙和这类油脂，需要它才能够运行，我已所剩不多。”这就是你为什么渴望得到它，所以，当你想要桔子，就把桔子的能量带给身体。所以，意念片刻，这些触发到……之光的场强进来自动连接你的内核，所以，你接收到，而且，收到多种东西的组合，甚至味道和气味。<br>我总跟你们说：不要只是点头同意所讲的，听过后要理解它的科学道理。就象我给孩子们讲的：如果你只是记住……如果发生事故，你忘记了……然后，你就不能！<br>（转录讨论：太准确了！竟然是：我们都忘记了！过去只知道：我们不能！）</p>
<p>But if You understand it, You never forget it.<br>Understand the science, understand the reason why - then you will see how the pleasure comes to be part of it.<br>Because then, as a layman, You contribute more than a professor. Because You look at it without prejudice.<br>This is important for all of us. If You are going to space You have to understand how everything is involved. Because in space there is You and me and I can lie to You for three days. But after the fourth day I am open, because I can not go on lieing, because You can read my mind.<br>但是，如果你真正理解，你从不会忘记这些。<br>理解科学，理解原因，然后，你会看到这带给你怎样的快乐！然后，作为非专业人士，你的贡献比教授还大，因为，你观察世界不带成见。<br>这对我们所有人都很重要。如果你进入太空，你必须理解所有事情是怎样涉及的。因为太空中，有你、有我，我可以对你说谎三天，但到第四天我就暴露了，我不能继续撒谎了，因为你能读出我的思想。</p>
<p>So, we clean the desk of all the mistakes of the past. （And when） we go to space, then we （can） go with no mistakes.<br>But we understand this time: We have everything,  we don´t need to make mistakes.<br>01:49:00<br>Understand , when we put these technologies on the table from now on, and I told You in the last two to three weeks: We are going full  blast into space technology.<br>所以，我们清除摆在桌面上的错误，这是过去造成的，然后我们进入太空，我们才不会犯错误。但是现在要明白，我们有了一切，我们不需要制造错误。要理解，从现在起，我们推送这些技术，我告诉你们，在过去2-3周，我们在全力以赴攻克进入太空的技术。</p>
<p>Because now You saw the matter.<br>Now You saw the GANS.<br>Now You have seen how it does.<br>Now You have the energy system that tells You that Your bill reduces.<br>Now You trust: “There is something there, I can work, I can trust it!”<br>And in trusting it, now You can feed Yourself.<br>01:49:23<br>You might say: “I wanted an orange but I did not feel it, so it didn´t work.”<br>May be, You wanted an orange to see if You are still in control, but You received it.<br>So we want to know, those of You who are starting to build these structures.<br>Because now we offer this unit, what we call ‘Universal Feed System’, which is twelve different design internally of a stacker for sale from next week. By next friday we offer it in the market. What we call ‘Universal Feed System’.<br>（ Remark from the transcribers:<br>Just for a recap:<br>Mr. Keshe said: “…  which is twelve … internally …<br>So the assumtion is true, that internally there are 3 complete star-formations used）<br>因为，现在你看到物质。<br>现在，你看到甘斯。<br>现在，你已经见识了它怎样起作用。<br>现在，你有了能量系统，并且让你的帐单减少。<br>现在，你信任：“这里发生了某些事情，我可以研究它，我可以信任它！”<br>你信任它，现在，你能供养你自己。<br>你可能说：“我想要桔子，但是我没有感觉到它，所以，这个不管用。”<br>也许，你想要桔子来弄清你是否能控制它，但是不行，你得不到。<br>所以，我们想了解你们那些正在开始构建这个结构的人。<br>因为，下一周，我们推出这个单元，名叫“宇宙供养系统”，它内部由12个不一样的叠子设计。下周五，我们这个“宇宙供养系统”上市。<br> （Person=人）</p>
<p>（转录讨论<br>扼要重述：<br>凯史先生说：“……内部有12个……”所以那个假说是正确的，就是它内部有3个完整的星体结构。）</p>
<p>01:50:00<br>You can try it, find it, position it the way you like it.  They come as 12 units in one box .<br>You receive a whacko box of it.<br>We are trying to price it in a way that it becomes affordable for a family or a street together to buy it.<br>Because when you buy a unit all the neighbours can eat into it, so you do collective shopping.  But you will find out you might eat if you need.  You might chew.<br>There is a figure we are working on – something in the region of between 5 – 7000 Euros. If we can drop it, we drop it.<br>But this is a collective unit. We trying to and we have to get it because the Magrav units have already passed the system.  It is a modification of the Magrav system.  You don’t need to plug it in anywhere because we set it up the way we know it has got to be set up.<br>So you just put the boxes around the house because now everything does it.<br>You need that unit to create that many.<br>But in the future then we tell you most probably you can use it as a power supply, … as a medicine supply and we tell you how it works.<br>以你喜欢的方式，你可以试验它，发现它，定位它，它们出自于同一盒子里的12个单元。你拿到的是一个超级棒的盒子！我们正在给它定价，让一个家庭或者街坊合作负担得起。因为，当你购买了单元，你的邻居们都有吃的了，所以，你们可以集体购买，但是，你会发现你将吃到你需要东西，你甚至会咀嚼。我们有个初步定价，在一些地区，大约售价5000-7000欧元，当然，还能降的话我们就降点。但这是一个集体单元，我们试着并且必须做到，因为，磁引力单元已经通过了系统验证，这是磁引力系统的升级版，在任何地方都不需要插电，因为我们知道设置它的必不可少的方法。所以，你只需把这个盒子放置在房子周围，此时，每样事情都可以做成，你需要这个单元创造很多。将来我们还要告诉你更多可能性，比如能量供给、……医疗支持，还告诉你怎样让它运作。</p>
<p>Because we are testing,  we are developing and you are part of the structure.<br>So in the next few weeks we will offer … in the next few/couple of weeks … because it takes us 30 days / 60 days to get it done the way we are doing it. We are very slow people.<br>But at least we hopefully get it right – you can buy a universal feeding system.<br>And these are both for you to understand you are buying it and testing it for the rest of us to learn. Because we have to see the scope of it, how far we can go.<br>We have to modify some structures inside and then we go to the next step or we can keep the same structure and add to it.<br>So the universal feed system will be offered.<br>我们正在测试它，正在研发它，你们是这个结构的一部分，未来几周，1-2周将要上市，做这个我们花了大约30-60天，我们是一群缓慢的人，但是至少，我们走在正确的路上，并且满心希望做好它——你可以购买一套“宇宙供养系统”。<br>要理解两方面，我们购买它，测试它，从它学习其余的。因为，我们必须看到它的边界，我们能走多远。我们必须修正某些内部结构，然后，我们进行下一步，或者，我们保持它的结构，在它上面增加。所以，“宇宙供养系统”很快上市。</p>
<p>But it is very interesting.  What we have done – as you know last Tuesday when we opened this.<br>The man who we put in the front to be on the firing line – Jackie – showed us the system he is doing it in the house.<br>But what we’ve done yesterday in the teachings of the Keshe Foundation:<br>More or less everyone volunteered to be part of the process because Jackie is a student as a Knowledge Seeker in that group.<br>One man refused to join the group and we know why. But we can’t say much and that man is me.<br>I refused to join the feeding system.  I explained it last night.<br>The reason why I refused in the night session which we had and that is part of the reason.<br>In a way I have to stay until I see you （are） all through and then I know my way out.<br>非常有趣，上周二我们开放这个系统，你知道我们做了什么？那个人叫杰克，我们把它推到前线，向我们展示在他房子里面做的系统。在昨天的凯史基金会教学中我们完成了这件事，多少有些人自愿做这个进程的一部分，在小组中，杰克是知识寻求者的一名学员。有个人拒绝参与小组，大家都知道原因，但是我们不能说那个人是我，拒绝参与供养系统，昨晚我解释了，在昨晚的课堂上，一方面原因，我必须留下来，直到看到你们都通过，然后，我知道我的任务完成了。</p>
<p>So what we have done – we tested the system further last night and I explained to the people who were in what I call the dinner table.   We were going to meet for dinner last night at eleven o’clock last night after the teaching.  We went through the process why some people see and why some people don’t understand and they don’t see.<br>For those of you who want to understand more about this new ‘Universal Feeding System’, that you don’t need to shop any more, we’re going to put these systems in major hungy accidental positions where in a disaster point everybody can eat from the same system.<br>You receive the energy,  you don’t need to go hungry.  You receive clean water because you receive it through the energy of the system. And in so many ways the infections and everything else you can receive to overcome any illnesses.<br>我们完成了，昨晚我们对系统进行了深一层测试，昨晚教学结束后11点钟，我们要进行晚餐会，那里我称为晚餐桌，我给大家解释，我们通过了那个过程，为什么有的人明白，有的人不理解也不清楚。<br>为了你们那些想要更多理解这个新的“宇宙供养系统”，你不必要购买更多，我们将要放置这些系统在主要的饥饿的地区，使灾区的每个人都能从同样的系统中得到供养。<br>你得到能量，你不必再挨饿，你得到清洁水，因为从这个系统的能量中得到，以多种方式，传染病还有各种疾病你都能在接收中克服掉。</p>
<p>At least we can try.   So in this process , in trying to do, last night we explained more for some people who don’t see or some people who see what the position is.<br>Go back to the Tuesday teaching.  The system is shown.<br>If Jackie is there: Jackie, can you come back and  teach us again and explain more and now we have the ten people in the Innovation and Space team which are connected with this system more or less without them wanting to.<br>We have 36, no actually we have less than 36, because one or two of them are in the other group.<br>We have something like 35 in the student group who we went through the list one by one.<br>至少我们能试，在这个进程中，试着去做。有人不清楚，有人清楚来到什么位置，昨晚我为他们解释了很多。<br>回到周二教学中，展示过这个系统。<br>如果杰克在这里：杰克，你能回去再教我们一次，能解释更多吗？现在，我们创新和空间团队有10个人，这个系统与他们多少都有连接，并非他们想要什么。<br>我们还有36人，不对，少于36人，因为有1-2人在其它小组。照名单清点下来，我们学生组大概有35人。</p>
<p>We asked every individual: Would you like to accept to receive to use the energy system for the food and they all confirmed and we went through that.  Nobody can say they did it without us receiving the consent of every single one and then that’s nearly 45 and then we have 5 people, 6 people present in the testing.<br>01:55:00<br>That makes about fifty people. We have set up a fifty people group of people how to get energy, food and feed/freed their emotions.<br>We are not looking for what they eat because now that the system is set up, the system without wanting it, it just continuesly takes what it needs.<br>我们问每个成员：是否同意接受能量系统用于食物方面？他们都很坚定答应，然后我们通过了，如果我们没有得到每个人的同意，没有人能够参与。就这样，接近45人，有5-6人现在正在测试中。<br>大约55人，成立了55人小组，教他们得到能量，去供养他们的情感并使情感自由。<br>我们不寻找他们吃什么，因为，系统已经设定好，系统不与你想要什么关联，它只是持续地生产它需要的。</p>
<p>But we are monitoring, what his body gives back out. We are looking for the excrements, we are looking for urination. Because at this moment more or less that’s the only indication we have that the body is not using any more solid food, matter-state food or matter-state air.<br>So, the process is very simple, we ask the state of emotion and we ask for what we call the residual. When you take enough energy from the environment, the way we thought, we always said you take 80% of your energy from your environment and 20% from the solid food you eat. Now you understand with this process when he is taking 100% from the environment, with understanding the work of the new supply of energy which is your ‘Magrav Universal Feeding System’.<br>但是我们在监视他的身体馈出什么。我们收集粪便和尿液，因为，这时，这多少是我们能得来仅有的指标，身体没有利用更多的固体食物，物质态的食物或者物质态的空气。<br>所以，过程很简单，我们关心情感状态，收集残留物，当你从环境中获取足够的能量，通过这条途径，我们过去总说，你从环境中获取80%的能量，从你吃的固体食物中获取20%的能量。现在，通过这个过程，随着对你的“宇宙磁引力场供养系统”能量供应工作的理解，就可以说你从环境中获取100%能量。</p>
<p>We will be monitoring if your urination or your excrements reduces. If you see you don’t go to toilet or you don’t go to for what I call urinating, then you understand that your body is transforming. And I inform , and I tell you, you had a Magrav System, if you go through this, has a responsibility.<br>The responsibility is to you yourself.<br>Because once you start absorbing Universal Energy, your body will start mutating in a way what is not needed will be not used but it won’t rot away.<br>The body has the habit to cool down in case it might change or, if the change is so rapid, it might shut it down because I don’t need it any more.<br>我们将会监视你的大小便是否减少，如果你发现你不去厕所大小便，说明你的身体正在转换，我点破，我告诉你，你有磁引力系统，如果你通过这一关，你具有一种责任。<br>这个责任是给你自己的。<br>因为一旦你开始吸收宇宙能量，你的身体就开始突变，它不需要，不按常规，但是它将不会腐烂掉。<br>在身体转变的情况下，它已经习惯于平静下来，如果它过于急速改变，它可能会让它进入停息状态（it might shut it down），因为我不再需要它。</p>
<p>So, in this process, start number of possibilities. When you enter and purchase or build these units, you can start losing your physical appetite which is for the eating. In that process, because you are not eating but you receive all the energy you need, the body doesn’t go in a commotion of what are called crisis. It finds a solution but it doesn’t eat.<br>然后，在这个过程中，你显现出多数潜能。当你进入这些单元，或购进这些单元，或建造这些单元，你能开始放弃你伴随吃而带来的身体方面的嗜欲。在那个过程中，因为你不用吃但你从宇宙中获取你所需的全部能量，在危机中身体不再进入暴躁和骚动。不用进食，它找到了解决方案。</p>
<p> We’ve seen this, in our body we have couple of pieces which we don’t see any function for it. We can take it out and nothing happens. Appendix is one, your tonsils are another one. So as the body holds on to your intestines and into your liver and kidneys and the rest, what is having no function it just runs them in the background with no use, zero operation.<br>But, as nothing comes in that can cause the infection, your mouth will shut. Because you are not taking anything in, the moisture does not allow the closure (01:58:24) and the voice will go. We will not speak.<br>我们已经知道，在我们身体中，有一两样我们看来没有什么功用的部件，我们可以从身体中去除它但不会有事，阑尾是一个，扁桃体是另一个，同样，你的身体所依靠的肠道、肝、肾和其它，不再需要它的功能，只是在背景中空载运行，零操作。但是，也不会有东西侵入身体导致感染，你的嘴会闭上，因为，你不靠嘴来讲任何事，湿度不足以闭合（…）,声音会失去，我们不再讲话。</p>
<p>Because now that this position has arrived, we will speak through appearance, the controller which is our emotion. So we start communicating seeing each other, feeling each other, understanding what other says without the voice. We see the true face of the man, the true emotion of the man. You cannot, as I said in my other teachings, you cannot say “my darling I love you” when you already have another mistress who’s just for bed (01:58:58), you have to say it to get your food on your table because you had your fun out somewhere else.<br>达到这个点，我们将靠外在来交谈，情感是外在的管理员。我们开始互相用眼神沟通，互相感知，不靠声音来理解对方说什么。我们看到人的真面目，人的真感情。你不能，如我在另一次教学中说的，如果你有了另一个情妇，仅仅是为了跟她上床，你不能对她说：“亲爱的，我爱你”，你必须只能以你桌上的食物做话题，因为，除了“那事儿”，你还有你的乐趣。</p>
<p>So, this is becoming very important, and in that way we become transparent, we become correct and in that process, when we go a step further in the next twelve months, you would lose your lung, the use of your nostrils. Because now that the energy intake is from the environment, gradually the whole thing will go in a way that the emotion will follow the physicality and will go at the same energy level. You’ll find out you do not need lungs to breath so you might keep the body for some time, same as it is, but you tap into Universal Energy or into your feed structure system that feeds you. In that process we become detached from matter-state inertia, because when we eat matter, we only operate through the matter and the GANS.<br>之后，就变得非常重要，在那种状况中，我们变得透明，在那过程中我们变得正确。在接下来的12个月，当我们向前迈进一步，你会闲置你的肺和鼻孔，因为这时，你从环境摄入能量，所有事情渐渐来到，情感伴随物理身体，两者将到达相同的能量水平。你将发现你不需要肺进行呼吸，所以你可以保留你的身体一段时间，象原来一样。但你挖掘到宇宙能量或进入你的供养结构系统中，你就能养活你自己。在那个过程中，我们来到与物质惯性分离。而如果我们延续吃物质食物，我们只能通过在物质层面和甘斯层面上来运作。</p>
<p>02:00:00<br>As I explained in other teachings. Earth has two attributes of fields: One is gravitational-magnetic field we call gravitational fields and magnetic fields and one, this is created by the interaction of the plasmas and the other one is from the state of matter-state which is the crust.<br>So, Earth is a combined gravitational-magnetic field. Gravity of the plasma plus the inertia which is the matter-state, so in us, not using any more matter state and we rely on the energy from the plasma of the Earth, we become independent of the matter and we become part of the true plasma of the creation.<br>如我在另一次教学中解释过，地球有两种属性的场:引力-磁力场，我们叫作引力场和磁力场，这是由等离子体交互作用创造的，另一种是来自物质状态的地壳。<br>也就是，地球是引力场和磁力场的组合，等离子体的引力场给物质状态加载惯性，在我们也一样，不用更多的物质状态，我们靠地球等离子体的能量，我们就从物质上独立出来，我们就真正成为造物的等离子体的一部分。</p>
<p>So now, in that position, we become man of the space because we have done with the matter-state.<br>In the holy books, they write it as detachment. This is the true beginning of the process of detachment from physicality. From physical life. So, we become the man of the space. This is what I’ve said in the other teachings. For the first time, man is not going or does not go through the evolution, and, because he has to, but now we decide to live a correct life, not to eat another being, not to destroy another life.<br>那么在这个点上，因为我们结束了物质状态，我们才能成为太空人。<br>在圣经里面，他们写到“分离”，这才是真正的开始与物理身体分离的过程，与物理生命分离的过程。然后，我们成为太空人。这就是我在另一次教学中说过的，这是第一次，人类不通过进化，因为，他不得不！但是，现在我们决定让生命走上正轨，不是靠吃掉别的存有，不去毁灭别的生命。</p>
<p>We call it Apple or vegetables, because they are all living things. They all carry protein in it so they have a life. They decide. We don’t eat the lamb or a sheep, because we decide, as I’ve said in my teachings before, we never thought why does man in such a turmoil of anger and animalness, because our emotion hears and feels the emotion of the animal we ate, and it does not accept the behavior of the physicality to do such a thing. Now we don’t consume. The physicality and emotion come in balance. Man becomes the peaceful creatures of the Universe.<br>苹果或蔬菜，它们都是活着的事物，它们内部都有蛋白质，所以，它们有生命，它们决定，我们不吃羊和羊羔。因为，我们决定，象我在之前的教学中说过，我们从未想过，为什么人类混乱、愤怒，象动物一样，因为，我们情感听到和感觉到我们吃下去的那些动物的情感，它们不同意物理身体的行为去做这种事情。现在，我们不再挥霍，肉身和情感达到平衡。人类成为宇宙中的和平生物。</p>
<p>Then, in that position, we open the door of Heaven to man. The day of judgment is those who want to be abusers and stay and stick to the physicalities and those who want to be correct and take the path of the universal attitude.<br>This is what has been written in the holy books, the day of Judgement. You judge yourself. There is no god and there is no court.<br>And I said this before in the teachings. It’s you who decides. You enter the space ship, because you build that space ship the way you made the star formation.<br>This is what you have to understand what you are getting involved in when you enter  the Space Ship Program. It’s the decision of the man to dictate his own evolution and his own destiny.<br>那么，在这个点上，我们向人类打开了天堂之门。审判日，一些人想滥用、保留、粘住物理身体，另一些人想走在正确的宇宙之路上。<br>这是写进圣经里——审判日，你自己审判自己。没有神，没有法院。<br>我说过，这次教学之后，由你们来决定。你们进入太空，由你们构建星体结构来建造太空船。<br>当你加入太空船程序，你必须理解与之牵涉的事情。这是人类的决定，命令他自己进化和决定他自己的命运。</p>
<p>You become the judger of yourself. Do I want to stay as a man, to abuse and still eat and murder, or do I become man of peace, that I am transparent.<br>The same as we’ve done with the Keshefoundation technologies, everything is on the table, transparency. Now, you understand. To be able to teach you, we had to live the life. We offered everything, everything is on the table, no technology has been, because the followers of the prophet of the past followed the path of the prophet. If he murdered, they became murderers. That’s what we see with the Jewish powers, because Moses killed so many to them it’s normal.<br>Mohammad did the same and we see the followers and the Christ the same path of when they brought him to adultery we see what’s happening in Christianity.<br>你成为自己的法官：我想留下来继续作地球人——继续虐待、继续吃掉、继续谋杀？或者成为宇宙人，透明坦荡？<br>同样，我们完成了，随着凯史基金会技术，所有事情都明摆到桌面上。现在，你理解，为了能教给你们，我们必须供养生命，我们提供所有，所有事情都在桌面上，再也没有技术成为…。因为，先知的追随者跟随先知的脚步，如果他谋杀，他们也成为杀人犯，那就是我们看见犹太人的力量，因为，摩西曾杀害他们如此之多，这是常情。<br>穆罕默德也一样，他的信徒也一样。基督也走同样的路，他们成全他私通，你看看基督教都干些什么。</p>
<p>In this time, there is no mistake. In this time, there is clear transparency. It’s you who decide your evolution and the path into space. And this time, you build the reactors. This time, you build the cores, this time you want to buy the systems to be able to become the man of correct conduct, the man of space, and when the time comes in the coming teachings, we show you how to take yourself into space.<br>When the second sun appears does not matter anymore, because you carry the true essence of creation with you into the space and you will not be there because it is your decision. So, what is important to understand and what you hear from now on, understand the principle behind it.<br>这次，没有错误，这次，清晰透明，由你们决定你们的进化和进入宇宙的路径。这次，由你们来构建反应器，这次，由你们来建造内核，这次，你购买的系统能够使人类行动正确。在太空中，在接下来的教学中，我们向你们示范怎样让你自己进入太空。<br>当第二太阳呈现，一切都不重要了。因为你本自带着造物的真相，随着你进入太空，你将不在这里，因为那是你的决定。那么，理解什么最重要？从现在起你听什么？跟随着理解原理！</p>
<p>02:05:00<br>Understand every coil you turn to make these coils and the cores, you made a decision of yourself to open the door of the universe to man to yourself.<br>As I always say, I guided you like a shepherd into the slaughter house of the universe open free life. The only thing you slaughter is the misconduct of the past.<br>You want to live a correct life? Not to eat and consume anything else unless it’s given to you as an energy, which is the fields, then you come to understand. You come to understand the correctness of the conduct is within the emotion of the man.You come to understand that the emotion dictates the behavior of the physicality.<br>理解你绕制的每个线圈和它的内核，你自己作了一个打开宇宙之门的决定，对人类，对你自己！<br>我总是说，好比牧羊人进入屠宰场，我教导你们开启宇宙生命的自由，屠杀是你们过去唯一的不当行为。<br>你想让生命活在正途上，不通过进食，也不消耗任何物质，除非以能量场的形式供给你，接着，你就来到理解，你能理解行为的正确性就在人类的情感之内，你能理解情感左右身体的行为。</p>
<p>So, when we speak about these things, when we speak about the process of the change, the process of the change is for total humanity. And as I said, if you make as many of these units and give it as a gift this year when you give a gift for New Year, for Ramadan, for Christmas, for whatever, a birthday, give a Magrav system to a person. This is the gift of life. Without them knowing, it will change their lives. Because, the fields within the system interacts with theirs and when they receive what they want, they lose their grief, they lose their sorrows, because you elevate the emotion of the man to the level of joy. If you remember in the teaching last week, I explained in a very simple way, and maybe, maybe you understand more now.<br>所以，当我们讲这些事情，当我们讲转变的进程，转变的进程是对全人类来说的，如我说过，如果你今年制作很多这些单元，当礼物送给人，在新年，在斋月，在圣诞节送给人，无论什么，生日，送一套磁引力系统给人，这是生命的礼物！他们不知道，将会改变他们的生活。因为，系统内在的场会与他们互动，他们会得到他们想要的，然后，他们放下他们的悲伤，放下他们的不幸，因为你提升人类的情感到快乐的水平。如果你记得，在上周教学中我以简单的方式解释过，或许，或许你会理解更多。</p>
<p>If this is your main brain …  and if this is your fear, it’s closer, …and if it’s a joy, happiness is further out.So you reach to this level, that is giving unconditionally, …because you know you will receive that you have enough to give.<br>如果这是你的大脑（小圆弧黑），<br>这是你的恐惧感（实心椭圆），这是闭合体……<br>这是快乐感（较大圆弧黑），<br>幸福感离得更远一点（较大圆弧红）。 </p>
<p>你扩展到这个水平，这就是无条件给予（顶部最大圆弧天蓝）， </p>
<p>因为你知道，你将收到足够（右下最大圆弧天蓝）用以给予（左上重复最大圆弧天蓝）。  </p>
<p>Now you understand how the teachings are coming together.<br>There are no prophets, there are no service stations, there are no churches, there are no mosques, there are no messengers, there are no super markets, there are no thieves in the open spaces of the universe.<br>You are the judge of yourself according to the correct ethos of understanding. You only take what you need, and you only give when you don’t have any need for what you have. But you find out, that the more you give, the more you receive, because then you have more to give. It’s a fantastic world of creation.<br>现在你理解教学怎样来到一起。<br>在辽阔的宇宙太空中，没有先知，没有服务站，没有教堂，没有清真寺，没有信使，没有超市，没有窃贼。<br>你是自己的审判者，根据你们理解到的正确的社区理念，你只拿取你需要的，当你拥有但没有需求你就给出。但你发现，你给出越多你就得到越多，因为，你需要有更多用来给予。这是一个造物的奇怪世界。</p>
<p>And in time, when a number of you come together of the same ethos, the way three layers of the skin of the man created the man, skin of the man, then you make your own space ship,<br>And the more of you joins into the understanding, the bigger the ship becomes.<br> And even this is an interim stage. There is more to it afterwards if you are knowledgeable and become just enough that you become part of the true universal community, which means you dictate the size of your own ship and you dictate what you want to eat, because you tap into the universal fields, not into the Magrav systems.<br>有一天，你们中许多人以相同的社区理念来到一起，借助人类的三层皮肤，人类长出来的皮肤，你就建成你自己的太空船，随着你们更多的人加入理解，更大的船就建成了。<br>甚至这只是一个过渡阶段，之后如果你知识渊博而且足够，那你就成为宇宙社区的一部分，就由你自己来确定船的大小，你确定你想吃什么，因为，你挖掘到了宇宙场，而不是磁引力系统。</p>
<p>But remember one thing, which was yesterday for the first time last night, I explained to the team at the dinner table. At the dinner table, I did not attend, so they started it. I was a late comer, as usual. French always come late, but I’m Iranian, we made a mistake somewhere. And the discussion goes, even yesterday in the teachings, in the private teachings, I said to people you take what you like, they are all there eating what they wanted, they explained to us what they had, this delicious blah blah. But, this is the behavior of man:<br>You give him the freedom, he takes everything, and it’s still is something wrong with you.<br>但是记住一件事，昨天晚上，在晚餐桌上我第一次给团队解释，我过去不吃晚餐，所以他们已经开始吃了，我后来加入，通常法国人爱迟到，但是我是伊朗人啊，我们在某处造成一些问题，讨论完成了，甚至昨天的教学中，在私下的教学中，我对人们说，你拿你喜欢的，他们全都在那儿吃他们想吃的，他们对我们解释他们有美味可口的什么一大堆，但是，这就是人类的行为：你给他自由，他仍然会把事情给你弄走样。<br>But I said, one thing you have forgotten. Last night I explained why I did not join you in your, what do you call it, festi<br>vity of food in the classroom, because…<br>02:10:00<br>Because you forgot the biggest, the biggest point. And the biggest point is:<br>How can I eat when I don’t give?<br>How can I receive when I have put nothing into it?<br>Before you start eating, before you help yourself to it, … you have to give!<br>Take what I do not need but I need enough to exist.<br>And then the system takes what you want to give and it gives back to you because it took.<br>It knows what to give to feed you back!<br>So, instead of getting in a hurry and eat, next time feed first before you eat!<br>我说，你们忘了一件事，昨晚我解释，我为什么没加入你们中，你们称之为聚会。教室里面的食品……<br>因为，你忘了最大最大的一点，就是：<br>我未给予，我怎么能吃；<br>我未对它付出我怎么能从它获取。<br>在你开始吃之前，先要帮助你自己，……你必须给予！<br>我不拿取，因我足以生存。<br>系统得到你想给它的，然后，它回馈你，因为它之前得到（你给予的）。它知道拿什么回馈你！<br>所以，不要一上来就匆匆忙忙开吃，下一次，你吃之前要先供养它！</p>
<p>This is the behaviour of the mothers and parents.<br>If you are a correct parent, you always serve your child first and then you eat. It’s the same behaviour. If you care for the universal community, if you care for your environment you live in, you give first.<br>And you see you receive so much that you don’t even know how to handle.<br>This is the story of a mother with four children:<br>She had only four eggs sitting around the table and the mother said “My children I only have four eggs and I give you everything so enjoy it.”<br>And all of them says “Oh no mom you can have half of ours”.<br>And she actually ate two and they ate half.<br>这是母亲或父母的习性，如果你是合格的父母，你总是先照顾孩子吃你再吃，这是同样的习性，如果你照顾你的宇宙社区，如果你照顾你居住的环境，你先给予它。<br>所以你明白，你收获这么多，甚至你都不知道怎样搬走它。<br>下面是一个母亲和四个孩子的故事：<br>她只有四只鸡蛋，他们围坐在餐桌旁，妈妈说：“孩子们，我只有四只鸡蛋，给你们每人一只，你们就享用吧。”<br>孩子们都说“哦，不，妈妈，我们每个人的一半给你。”<br>然后，妈妈实际上吃到了二只鸡蛋，孩子们吃半个鸡蛋。</p>
<p>It’s the story of the universe!<br>The more you give, … She gave the love （and） they paid her back with physicality.<br> Think …  before next time you are pulled in by me:<br>“Why is he giving it to us free? Is he testing us or are we there to fail because of it?”<br>It’s not for me! It’s for you to judge yourself. I give you so much that you get drowned in the love of the creator.<br>这是宇宙的故事！<br>你给予越多，……，她给出爱，他们回报她有形的东西。<br>想想，……下次之前，你被我拉住：<br>“为什么他无偿给予我们？是不是在考验我们，或者我们在这方面做得失败？”<br>这不是为我！是为了你对自己进行审判。我给你们这么多，你被淹没在造物者的爱中。</p>
<p>Jackie if you want to explain for the people who were not with us on Thursday on Tuesday, about your system and what is developed since Tuesday.<br>杰克，你是否给周二没有和我们一起的人们解释一下你的系统，同时，周二之后又有什么进展？<br>Jackie’s Experiences杰克的经验</p>
<p>02:12:28 （Jackie’s Experiences杰克的经验）<br>Yes Sir, no problem. So, at the beginning we…<br>I’m part of the spaceship team and we tried to manage the star formation and we work as a team to build the system.<br>And one time you come to me and ask some questions. And I answer to you, and you said OK, I will add to the knowledge on this.<br>And you start a new process to try to start feeding with a star formation system like you explained before.<br>And we tried with the system, so you asked me to try to feel an orange, it’s taste, it’s smell, it’s texture and all this kind of things.<br>And I can have it!<br>And then I try with different perfumes, smells and different thing.<br>I can have it!<br>Then you asked me to put some different emotions in the system: Joy, happiness, sadness, everything …<br>And I can have, I can have all the emotions!<br>Then you asked me to try to communicate with dead people.And I can have it, I can speak with these people!<br>好的，先生，没问题，那我们开始……<br>我是太空船团队成员，我们试验星体结构，我们团队合作构建这个系统。<br>有一次，您来问我一些问题，我回答了，然后您说ok，我将在这方面增加知识。现在，您又启动了一个“供养”新进程，如您之前解释过，尝试由星体结构系统来供养。<br>我们尝试从这个系统，所以，您要求我去感觉桔子，它的味道、气味、纹理所有这类事情。我做到了。<br>现在，我尝试不同的香水、气味以及其它不同的东西，我做到了。<br>谢谢您要求我把不同的情感加入系统：快乐、幸福、悲伤，各种……，我做到了，能加入各种情感！<br>然后，您要我尝试跟死去的人交流，我做到了，我能与这些人对话。</p>
<p>So after you will see if we can manage to have other persons （which maybe） can have the same results as me.<br>So I invite six of my best friends, very confident to try and test the system.<br>And the five, six people make an agreement to try this experience.<br>And you make the same process as me with the six people and the six people have exactly the same results as me!<br>They can smell, they can eat, they can receive the energy from the system. They can have everything they want, a starter, a meal, a dessert, they can have meat, they can have vegetables, fruits, chocolate, alcohol, water, like they want.<br>依照您的知识，将会看到，我们能让别人也能做到和我一样。<br>所以，我邀请了6个最好的朋友，很自信地去尝试，去测试系统。这6个人达成共识，进行这项验证，您给这6个人设置了和我一样的程序，这6个人非常准确地得到和我一样的结果。<br>他们能闻到气味、能尝出口味、能接收来自系统的能量，他们能得到他们想要的任何东西，一道菜、一餐饭、甜点，他们可以吃到肉，可以吃素菜、水果、巧克力、酒精饮料、水，所有他们想要的东西。</p>
<p>And then we can make different experience with all these things.<br>So we manage the experience for five days.<br>Every evening we meet together and try to feed ourselves and give the result of the experience.<br>So a lot of people reducing the consuming of food like I think 60 – 70 %. For myself I don’t eat anything from two days and 80 % less of food in five, the last five days.<br>Then like you said in the teaching of yesterday for the three years program we decided as a group the 37 people to try the experience and the majority of the people can have the same result.<br>See the food, smell the food, eat the food, take the energy of the food and all this kind of things.<br>我们通过所有的事情创造不一样的体验。<br>然后，我们管理这五天时间的体验。<br>每天晚上我们聚集一起，尝试供养我们自己，然后给出体验的结果。<br>所以，我认为，许多人可以减少60-70%食物消耗，对我来说，从第二天起，我不吃任何东西，最后五天，减少80%的进食量。如您在昨天教学中谈到关于三年程序的问题，我们决定了组成37人的小组尝试这种体验，多数成人可以得到同样的结果。看食物，闻食物，尝食物，从食物摄取能量，所有这些事情。</p>
<p>And yesterday you know, something really strange happened with the system because two people of the group, of the beginning, the six persons, have the same feeling that the system is less workable.<br>And we think all the day regarding that and in the evening you come with the solution.<br>Because we all make a mistakes, we all want to take of the system, and we take, we feed, we take a lot of people, we take, take, take.<br>But we only forget one thing:<br>It’s to give to the system because the system can give you anything if you can feed the system, you know.<br>您知道，昨天，这个系统发生了奇妙的事情，先是小组中的两个人，然后六个人，都同样感觉到系统不大运作了。<br>我们想是这一整天导致的，晚上您带来了解决方案。<br>因为，我们都犯了一个错误，我们只想着从这个系统索取，我们取出，喂养，我们取出给很多人，取出，取出，取出。<br>但是，我们只是忘了一件事情：给予系统。<br>因为，你知道，如果你能供养系统，系统才能给你任何东西。</p>
<p>So all the night all the team make a beautiful job to feed the system and to give some appreciation, love and they feed a lot the system so now the system is fully functional again, you know.<br>Because all the night we, all the team yeah, made a beautiful job to feed, and to give a lot, and now this is a, the system has a lot of resources and we can feed anyone who want to take.<br>We are here to serve the people who need feed from the system.<br>And a, yeah, it’s a beautiful experience.<br>然后，我们团队整个晚上干了一件漂亮事，就是供养系统，给予欣赏，给它爱，他们供养它很多，所以，现在，这个系统功能再次完善，你知道的。整个晚上，整个团队，干得漂亮，供养它，给它很多，现在系统拥有充足的资源，我们能供给任何人只要他想得到。<br>我们这里为那些需要从系统摄取食物人们服务。<br>真得耶！这真是很美好的体验。</p>
<p>But what the important thing is you know, it’s really a group decision.<br>At the beginning it’s for myself … then it’s for six persons …. and then it’s for thirty-seven persons who decided and make an agreement:<br>If we start the process we can make a step forward, you know.<br>We need to continue on the process and it’s not one decision, it’s a group decision. It’s a very nice people, very dedicated to the, to this, and. Yeah now it’s forty-five people who decided to carry on this experience.<br>但是，你知道，什么最重要，事实上是群组的决定。一开始，自己……然后，六个人，然后，37个人，作出了一致协议。<br>你知道，如果我们开始这个进程，我们就可以向前迈进一步。<br>我们需要持续这个进程，这不是一个人的决定，这是群组决定，这些善良人，专注于此的人，现在是55人在决定持续进行这种体验。</p>
<p>Yeah we become stronger and stronger and every people play the game, it’s really beautiful, you know.<br>And we are there for the people who need our help, we are ready to open the flow, the people can take what they want from the system.<br>But after they need to understand what they are doing you know.<br>Because if you take you need to perhaps to give something perhaps. It’s open, we are there for people who want. So here is my experience and the experience of … （screeching and silence）.<br>是啊，我们越来越强大，每个人都在玩这个游戏，这真是很美妙的。你知道。<br>我们这里帮助那些需要我们帮助的人们，我们准备好了放开流量，人们可以从这个系统取出他要的，但是之后，他们需要理解他们做什么，因为，如果你取出你需要的，也许，需要你（先）给予一些，这一点你们明白的。我们这里为需要的人开放。<br>这就是我的体验。</p>
<p>02:20:00 - 02:25:00<br>（M. Keshe）<br>Thank you Jackie<br>（Jackie）<br>Your very welcome Mister.<br>（M. Keshe）<br>We have started a process of making man the man of the space and in so many ways what is beautiful we see in front of us the picture of the earth, one planet.<br>The forty-five, fifty people who are involved in this process are from across the planet.<br>They are from Africa, we have a number of people from Canada, from United States, we have people from China, we have people from Asia, we have people from Europe, and they’re all in it.<br>There is something like maybe thirty nations involved. In a way there is one nation. Thirty people from planet earth are there involved.<br>凯史：谢谢你杰克！<br>杰克：不客气，先生！<br>凯史：<br>我们已经以多种方式开始了人类进入太空的进程。我们面前的地球图像真是非常美妙!一个星球。</p>
<p>（自由能源交换世界和平）<br>55个人涉入这个穿越星球的进程。许多人——来自非洲、加拿大、美国、中国、亚洲、欧洲，他们都来到这个程序里面，大约涉及30个国家，以一个国家的方式，这个星球30个国家的人合并在一起。</p>
<p>And once you start building these units you will understand one thing:<br>Because you built it with a purpose of peace, you will achieve peace, and I as said in my talk on Tuesday, if each one of you buy a unit or make a unit and donate one unit, in that process very fast we cover the whole planet and we reach everyone, even the fish and the lion and the rest.<br>The only problem is when we don’t eat each other the way we done will our emotion create a balance that the number reaches a point:<br>一旦你开始建造这些单元，你将明白一点：<br>因为，你以和平为目的来建造，你将实现和平，我在周二谈话中说过，如果你们每个人都购买一个单元，或者制造一个单元、或者捐赠一个单元，这个进程会很快覆盖这个星球，我们延伸到每一个，甚至鱼、狮子及其它物种。<br>唯一的问题就是我们做到了不再互相吃掉对方，我们建立了情感上的平衡，量级达到一定的点上：</p>
<p>I’m not eating you, do you mind lamb, I’m a lion but I can’t eat you anymore, if you go a bit more then there is no more room to live, do you mind your lot slowing down a little bit.<br>The same thing with the other animals, they’ll start accommodating each other because they don’t eat each other.<br>Your biggest problem will be would it be enough place on this planet for all of us as creatures of this planet to live in peace amongst and between each other?<br>我不再吃掉你，你在意羊羔了吗？我是一头狮子，我不能再吃掉你，你们增多吧，增多到没有更多生活空间，你留意到很多事情都在一点点慢下来吗？<br>同样的情况发生在动物身上，他们彼此之间开始和谐融通，因为，不再吃掉对方。<br>你们最大问题将变成，这个星球有没有足够多的地方让这个星球上在和平中的生物来生活，以及保持他们之间（的距离）。</p>
<p>This is not anymore dreams, this is become the reality, and as I said it’s in our hands to change the future and change the evolution. I showed you the way you change energy to become free of energy and I shown you the way now you can change if you decide to leave this planet to prepare yourself for change of the physicality to become passenger of space by becoming independent of the matter-state of this planet.<br>This is where the process is going and this is where we are destining for. In the next few weeks you will see the first crafts but it’s no use getting into the crafts when you still carry the body of the man with a matter attachment.<br>这不再是梦想了，已经变成现实，如我所说，走向未来走向进化掌握在我们手里。我向你们展示实现自由能源，现在如果你决定离开这个星球，让肉身从物质状态的地球上独立出来成为太空乘客，由你为自己作准备。<br>这里，进程在持续，我们在决定宿命。<br>在未来一二周，我们将看见第一件工艺品（指宇宙服），但不是用于穿着的工艺品，因为你要继续携带你的物理身体，保持着对物质的依恋。</p>
<p>We don’t ask you to change, you stay the same, but in a way did you change when you wear the diving suits, or did the man change when he wore the spacesuit? Now we wear the universal suit. But this time we don’t need the camouflage of the suit it’s us ourselves which decides what to do, what to put on.<br>If you learn this process, in a radical way, you will find out that your body will react to the environment you arrive in according to the correct conduct.<br>我们不要求你转变，你保留原样，但是，当你穿上潜水服你改变了吗？当你穿上太空服你改变了吗？现在，我们穿上宇宙服。但是，这次我们不必伪装，是我们自己决定穿上它。<br>如果你以一种激进方式学习这个进程，你会发现你的身体将与环境起反应，依照正确的行为根据，你接近（目标）了。</p>
<p>So you become the citizens of any planet on any point in this universe. Now you see, you were happy to go from Washington to Teheran, now you go from star to star. Now you become the passengers of going from every corner of this universe to another. And don’t forget, you were worried about the speed of light.<br>In the past few minutes you heard, thirty-seven people, they thought of chocolate, of pizza or whatever, they received it instantaneously.<br>02:25:00 - 02:30:00<br>This is a zero time travel - zero time essence of creation.<br>如果你成为宇宙中任何星球任何点上的公民，现在你看，过去你从华盛顿旅行到德黑兰就很快乐，现在，你是在星系之间旅行，你成了从这个宇宙任何角落去别的宇宙旅行的乘客，别忘了，你们曾经担心（超）光速的问题。<br>几分钟前你们听到了，37个人，他们意念巧克力、比萨或者别的什么，会马上得到。<br>这就是零延迟旅行——造物的零延迟实相。</p>
<p>And then, where You want to be - You will be instantaneously.<br>You just learn to receive. Now, when You learn to be detached from the physicality of matter-state， the universe is Your voice.<br>Which means, if You don´t understand english, it is all Yours, take it. But be correct.<br>We need no kings, we need no leaders, we need nobody to tell You You are wrong or right, because I can read Your emotion, I can see Your intention, and if You always carry good intentions, You do not see any colours and You become transparent as the universe.<br>When You wear colours, which means, You create problems, or You want something else to mark Your territory, I look if that territory is good for me or if I want to be in that （marking point ?）.<br>然后，你想去哪里，你马上在那里。<br>你只要学习接受。现在，当你学习与物质状态的肉身分离，宇宙就是你的声音，就是说如果你不懂英语，它就是你的全部，把握它，做对它。<br>我们不需要国王、不需要领袖、不需要身体来告诉你对错，因为我能读懂你的情感，我能看见你的意图，如果你总带着善意，你看不出任何色彩，你变得和宇宙一样透明。<br>当你外面罩着色彩，说明你在制造问题，或者你还想做某些事情来拉你的山头，我要看这个山头是否对我有利，或者我是否成为……</p>
<p>02:26:11<br>“I made man in the image of myself .”<br>It is the first time man can see the true image of the creator:<br>TRANSPARENT<br>Read Koran??? - bless his name - Mohammad has written ??? ( I don´t understand Keshes words)<br>God has one hundred names. Ninety nine is written in Koran.<br>The hundred they say if they read the bit sincerity from the beginning to the end - You’ll find the hundredth one and nobody has got it ????<br>02:26:46<br>The hundredth one is called himself.<br>“我照我的样子创造人类。”<br>太初第一眼能看见造物的真实图像——“透明”！<br>读《古兰经》——以他的名祝福——穆罕默德已经写到……<br>神有100个名字，《古兰经》里面写了99个，他们说如果你们从头到尾仔细阅读，你就会找到第一百个名字，但是没有人找得到。<br>那第一百个名字是——<br>自己！</p>
<p>02:27:03<br>Rick<br>MR Keshe, can I just read that, what just showed up in the chat from Libby, she says:<br>“I asked the system to feed me love and right after tuesday’s workshop ended I had two surprise visitors show up at my door to give and receive love and then two more friends showed up and had brought soup to share… love is the most incredible nourishment we can offer to each other.”(from Libby)<br>瑞克：<br>凯史先生，我想读一下聊天室来自莉比的发言：<br>“星期二教学结束后，我请求系统供给我爱和正确，令人惊奇的是两个访客来到我门口做出给予爱和接收爱的表示，然后，更多的朋友出现，带着靓汤来分享……啊，爱是超多美妙的营养品，我们能互相分享。”（来自莉比）</p>
<p>MTKESHE<br>Please don´t ask for something else.<br>Because people receive the fields from Your essence of creation and when it’s true, is received.<br>And now that we know that we can’t lie we can’t receive   … we will receive ???? … we get to that point …<br> So, in so many ways our teaching hasn´t finished, our teaching has just started:<br>To learn the language of the universe, the conduct of the universe.<br>We still make the nano coating, we still make the coils, we still make the reactors , because we have to teach seven billion to behave correct, and while we are making for them, there are trillions of them in the waters and in the seas and on the land. We still got to change their lives to understand that they don´t need to eat and kill each other.<br>凯史：<br>请不要再索取。<br>因为你接收到的是造物给你的实相的场，只有它真实，才能接收到。我们知道，我们不能撒谎，我们不能拿取，……我们将得到……我们要抓住要点。<br>所以，在某些方面，我们的教学还未完成，我们的教学才刚开始，我们要学习宇宙的语言，我们一直制造线圈，一直制造反应器，因为，我们必须要教育70亿人行为不逾规矩，我们让他们……。<br>有亿万人在水中，在海中，在陆地上，我们持续改变他们的生活（方式），直到他们理解到他们不再吃掉和杀害彼此。<br>The love will flood this planet beyond man´s imagination.<br>Because, it’ll be who can serve:<br>“ Excuse me , Mr. Ant, can You move a little bit, I can´t go, if you don’t want … Do you mind me to put you on a planet somewhere and it´s all Yours. That I can not kill You or hurt You.”<br>And You hear the language of the ant : “ Yes, just don’t mind because that might be nicer for me.”<br>爱将覆盖这颗星球，超过人类的想象力。<br>因为，将变成能够服务他人：<br>“对不起，蚂蚁先生，你能移动一点点吗，我能，如果你不想……你在意我送你到某地，这都属于你的，我不能杀你或者伤害你。”<br>你听到蚂蚁的话：“好的，别介意，或许那样对我更好。”</p>
<p>The beauty with this technology is: It’s the knowledge of the creator, if  You understand it.<br>And if You don´t understand it and still want to be matter-state you’re and object, You will find every way to object it and find a way not to do it.<br>But in a way, there are so many people, who are fed up with the wars.<br> that soon, the way we are going and the systems are going to be manufactured, and when the systems run, I always remember, what Lisa said, ( that lady from China) : The Chinese scientists where they put these reactors, they call it “ THE HAPPY ROOM”<br>Now you know they were first, before even me get to, with the “ THE UNIVERSAL UNIT”.<br>这个技术之美妙：这是造物的知识，如果你理解到的话。<br>如果你不理解，你和你的目标仍然处于物质状态，你会发现达到目标的每条路都行不通。<br>但是，在某方面，有如此多的人对战争忍无可忍。<br>马上我们要批量生产的单元，我总记得中国丽萨女士说的，中国科学家放置这些反应器的地方，他们称之为“快乐房间”。<br>现在你知道了，他们是第一次，之前甚至我也是第一次拿到这个“宇宙单元”。</p>
<p>Because they received the feeling, not the food. And now we feed, what the man has been ???fooded???: The food of the soul of the man.<br>And You can even receive this with the system, if You know how to position it.</p>
<p>02:30:05<br>You can elevate your own souls with the same system, if you understood all the teachings of the past.<br>Any questions?<br>No questions?<br>因为他们接收到感觉而不是食物，现在，我们供养，人类被……喂养……，人类灵魂的食物。<br>通过这个系统甚至你也能接收这些，只要你知道怎样设置它。<br>用同样的系统，你能提升你自己的灵魂，如果你理解过去所有的教学。<br>有问题吗？<br>没有问题？</p>
<p>Rick: Quite crowd again here … It’s a pretty quite crowd again here<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Because now man has become the judge of himself, hah?<br>Robert:<br>Mr. Keshe, this is Robert from Utah. I just wanted to add a thank you to you youself and your crew, Rick and everybody and ?????? and Carolina as well, she does a lot of work in the background.<br>You guys, I really respect the way that you guys work very, very hard.<br>瑞克：这里再次相当拥挤……这是一个美妙的拥挤。<br>凯史：因为现在人们成为自己的审判者，嗯？<br>罗伯特：<br>凯史先生，我是来自美国犹它洲的罗伯特，我想对您本人和你的团队表示感谢！感谢瑞克、每个人、……和卡罗莱纳的，她在幕后承担了很多事情。<br>你们大家，我真心表示由衷敬意，你们大家工作非常非常努力。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:<br>There is an old say, they say:<br>Behind every successful man there is a successful woman.<br>Robert:<br>Right. Also on my own know I just wanted to add: In the first workshops I heard a lot about “praying” with your units and I really think that it’s important to kind of treat each one almost as a child.<br>And bring them up in a way as you creating them that you get out of them what you put in.<br>And that’s just a kind of something that I took from the first workshops and I don’t hear as much any more about. My understanding, but that’s something that I thought was important.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>What you mean there exactly?<br>凯史：<br>还是那句老话：每一个成功男人背后都有一个成功的女人。<br>罗伯特：<br>非常好！我自己知道，我只想说，在第一学院我听到许多关于借助您的单元进行“祈祷”，我真正认识到，要疗逾人类每个人乃至于小孩，祈祷是非常重要的。带着他们成长，以您创造的方式，那就是——<br>“你取出的来自你馈入的”。<br>我从第一学院学到的一种叫什么呢，除此之外，我不知道还听到什么别的，我的理解力，我想是某种非常重要的。<br>凯史：你的意思是刚刚好吧？</p>
<p>Robert:<br>Just to treat them （the Magrav units） … you know … if you put goodness into them when you’re creating them, you’re creating a new time-line for these devices ?????? (02:32:08) put them all together and everything together with them … and I just think it’s important to start them on a good time-line. Maybe pray with them … whatever you do to connect to the one, you know, the spirit.<br>And maybe do that with the stackers as well. And intend for them the same good stuff that you would want for yourself.<br>罗伯特：<br>对待它们（磁引力单元）……你知道……你在制作的时候，如果给它善意，那你就在对这些装置创建它的新的时间轴（time-line），……，把它们放在一起，每件事情都和它们一道，……，我就认为，开启它们好的时间轴是很重要的。也许，给它们祈祷，……，无论怎样，你必须连接至“一”——你知道——那是真正的灵性。<br>同样的方式对待叠子单元，然后，预想好的东西给予它们，那等于是你自己想要的。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:<br>I see something very interesting:<br>Sombody has put in a figure of 85, nearly 86 billion combinations on what we just talked and I think there is much more than that.<br>（ Remark from the transcribers:<br>Aaaaah, … now we understand better: Mr. Keshe talked about the number of possible INTERACTIONS between each turn of each coil in each stacker amongst each other and with us.<br>And that are a lot more than 16,200 turns.<br>It is maybe the number of possible interactions between these 16,200 gravitational-magnetical field “entities” plus the number of additionally created fields like the two we did not consider in the calculation, the gravitational and magnetical which are additionally created out of the interaction of the inner 82 <em> 2 turns and the outer 144 </em> turns?<br>Could this be said in that way? Do you agree? ）<br>凯史：<br>我看见一些有趣的事情：<br>有人曾经提交一个数字——有850接近860亿种组合——，我们之前所谈的组合，我认为比那还多得多。<br> （转录讨论：<br>呵呵……现在我们更明白了，凯史先生对我们讲过关于叠子单元之中的线圈的每一圈之间的交互次数，圈数超过16200，这些16200个磁引力场“实体”交互线圈加上未考虑进去的，比如，内圈2<em>82，外圈2</em>144这些磁引力场线圈。可以这样认为吗？您同意吗？）<br>I usually make 400 – 600 million sets for different deseases.<br>But by next week calculate. Sit down and calculate and understand it how it works as a … what I call … combination and not as multiplication.<br>Is an order of magnitude, not multiplication.<br>Then you will see you’ll come to 1,000 times more than what you have been put there （the nearly 86 billion ）<br>If we get around 800 … just about … just over … lets say one trillion trillion combinations from the fields of your system … it’s just about right.<br> （ Remark from the transcribers:<br>We think, we are right, our last assumption seems to be correct.<br>And we see, how we stupid we are in just looking at the physicality. ）<br>我通常制作4-6亿个装置针对不同的病症。但要根据下周坐下来计算，然后理解它工作的方式……象我称作……是组合，而不是叠加。是数量级，而不是相加。<br>然后你将看见的是超过你设置的近860亿的1000倍。如果我们给定大约8000……只是大约……大约超过……一万亿的你们的系统场的组合，……，大约这就对了。<br> （转录讨论：<br>我们认为，我们对了，我们最后的假定似乎是正确的。我们明白，我们愚蠢到只看到物理身体这部分。）</p>
<p>Any other question?<br>Rick: Yeah, Mr. Keshe there is a question several times coming up in the last workshops regarding pace makers.<br>Candy has asked:<br>“Can people with pace makers feed from the system … （Mr. Keshe in the background: “Yes”） … and can they use the ‘Cup of Life’?”<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Ja, the “Cup of Life” is YOU!<br>还有别的问题吗？<br>瑞克：是的，凯史先生，这是关于心脏起博器的问题，在上次教学被数次提出来，坎迪问道：“带着心脏起博器的人能够从系统获取供给吗？”（凯史在背景中：“可以”）。还有他们可不可以使用“生命之杯”？<br>凯史：<br>嘿！“生命之杯”就是你！</p>
<p>I explained this on Tuesday. Please go back on the Tuesday （8th） international teaching.<br>We taught a lot on Tuesday. The Tuesday teaching is the backbone of the new space technology.<br>Listen to it, … understand it, … and then you go further with it.<br>You got to understand how everything works.<br>You got to understand how everything system atically connects.<br>If you have a pace maker, … that’s your heart.<br>Maybe, … maybe if you are within the facility of this system, and the conduct and everything else which is correct, you might not even need a pace maker. In time to come.<br>我在这周二解释过，请回到周二（第8次）国际教学。<br>我们在周二教授了很多内容，周二教学的是新的太空技术的主干内容，收听它……理解它……你会因此理解到更深一层。<br>你会弄明白万物怎样动作。<br>你会弄明白万物之间有条不紊的连接。<br>如果你有心脏起搏器，……那是你的心脏。<br>也许，也许未来，你融入这个系统，引导你的每个状况回归正确，你甚至不需要心脏起搏器。</p>
<p>第六部分<br>We had a very strange experience.  We were with doctor. Don’t mention his name.<br>And we have given twice a cancer unit to a man that already had a cancer. And he’s returned it.<br>我有一个奇特的经历，我们的一个医生，这里不说名字了，给了两次癌症单元给一个癌症病人，当他再次来，<br>When he returned it the second time we looked at  and he said to me it’s a very nice ???. It’s a proud to have him as a friend.  It’s a pleasure.<br>当他第二次来时，他说：这个非常好？？？，很高兴有这么个朋友？？？<br>He said: “Do You know something Mehran? Maybe he doesn’t want to live, if he’s already decided, we are pushing him?<br>他说：你知道Mehran?吗，可能他不想活了，如果他决定了，是我们逼迫他的吗？？？<br>Because he said to the nurse when he brought the unit back: When I use it I have no pain.’ ”<br>因为当他带着单元回来时他对护士说：“当我使用单元的时候就不痛了”<br>Maybe he has decided that: “I want to give the life to another stage”.<br>可能他决定了：我想重生<br>Is us who decides! Most of our diseases is our made.<br>大多数我们的疾病都是自找的，是我们自身的决定的。（上面几句信息不连贯，不知道说他还是说别人，大概就单元这有效）<br>Maybe, maybe one of the ways to walk away from  the cancers  which we carry  is to become a man of space. Because now,  when you close, you don’t take anything, your mouth is shut.  The body has to find a solution for what’s inside, ja?<br>可能，摆脱疾病的方法就是成为宇宙人，当你不再进食，你不吃什么东西，身体会找到一个平衡的解决之道，是么？<br>Maybe if we have a cancer lump it’s a very good source of energy for longer time. Because it has to move, it has to change, it has to give.<br>也许我们的肿瘤有了一个太久的能量之源（我们的情感决定如此吧），所以肿瘤不得不更加转移恶化。<br>Would we do what I said. Man will accept this technology out of the fear of itself  and not because of the beauty of it.  Because you are afraid of dying you go to the process, you become man of space. Then internally everything is sorted, you don’t have cancer but then you have a bigger problem.<br>就像我说的，人类将接受这项科技不是因为其的美妙而是对其的恐惧，因为你害怕死你才接收这个过程，成为一个太空宇宙人，然后所有的事情就有序了，你不再有癌症，另外就是<br>The bigger problem is now you live for thousands of years.  Once we have taken this food connection from  the physicality of the man and then find peace within  the physicality and the emotion, …<br>你会存在千年之久，一旦我们没有了食物跟肉体的链接，人类能够找到肉体和情感的平和（食物链是我们的攻击性破坏性的源头之一？）<br>Now, what is to kill you ?  Nothing! You become immortal.<br>那么现在，什么才能结束你的生命？你变的永恒了<br>All of you have been looking you want to live 200 years,  I’m giving you 10 million years.  Because then it’s you who decides “If I want to give up , I had  enough”  or you wanted to get staying.<br>你指望活200年，但是我给了你1千万年，因为一切你自己决定“我放弃。。我想我活的够久了”或决定继续活着<br>So those of you who are looking for “Cup of Life” and immortality, the “Cup of Life” and immortality is within you.  You just missed it.<br>所以，这个所谓的“圣杯”就是你自身，你们已迷失太久。<br>You are a cup! And if you don’t understand it:<br>如果你理解了，你就是圣杯，<br>One make a cup with an orange on it put other GANSes on  it and then taste the water, and you feel the taste of orange, the energy of the orange.<br>当你吧一个橘子放在有甘斯的杯子上，然后你喝水，就能感到橘子的味道，和有橘子的能量（以前教学）。<br>As I said in the teaching  you yourself are 80% water!<br>So why do you need anything else , put the orange on top of your head, you absorb. If your emotions is correct you receive it without eating!<br>你要做的是，将橘子放在你的头上，你的情感愿意的话你不用品尝就能吸收它（人也是是甘斯和水的类似结构）。<br>Then you don’t harm no one.  But now we made a bigger collection of a Super-Market of energies. A Hyper-Market of energies with  this stacker units. And then in the future when I educate you further  you will understand that  you can tap in into the universal Super-Market.<br>我们可以做到一个超级卖场那样多的品目的能量收集，而不用做出任何伤害破坏。将来当我指导你们，你们会明白到可以进入宇宙级的超级市场。<br>Because this way, when you learn,  not consume energy. It’s what I told you from the beginning.<br>以这种方式，你学会不用消耗（传统）能量，就像我一开始就说过的。<br>When you see something else you don’t look at it if it’s eatable.  It’s not a sheep it’s not a cow  It’s a life within existence and it has  to be respected as you know , when you meet says: “Do you have any surplus energy for me? I’m short of vitamin K and vitamin D.”<br>当你看见比如一些也不像羊不像牛的不像你已知的（智慧）生命体，你对他说：“你有多的能量给我吗？我缺少维生素K和D”<br>He says: “Do you have some shortage for me?  I’m looking for zibezibezibezip.  But your fields fit into my  bizibizi, in my planet bizibizi is what I need.”<br>外星生命体则说：“你有我缺的吗？我在找zibezibezibezip，在我们的星球我需要zibezibezibezip”<br>You give him bizibizi and  he gives you vitamin D and C and say “Goodbye”.<br>你给他zibezibezibezip，他给你维他命K，D，然后互道BYBY。<br>So now you understand why  we’re going through this process.  And then, the beauty of it is, once we come, and very fast we are coming to this point:<br>这样你就明白了我们为什么要通过这种方式，而且，美妙的是，很快我们就能达到这点。<br>Does a King have more than the layman on the street because they have everything they want?<br>街道上国王拥有的远比俗人多是因为他们拥有所有他们想要的么？<br>And then, would there a place for a ???seed of??? kingship,  or are we all the king of this planet  because we care for it, we look after it. Are we finished with the kingship ?<br>然后，……？（内容丢失），因为我们爱它，关心它，我们都是星球的王者，我们把以前的王国世界结束了吗？<br>Because we gave you everything for all to be the kings.<br>只因为我们给了你成为国王的一切。<br>Any other questions ?有其他问题吗<br>Klaus Priller - Flexible coils for the Helmet<br>Klaus Priller 头盔灵巧线圈<br>Mr Keshe, this is Klaus from Austria.<br>凯史先生，这是来自澳大利亚的Klaus Priller </p>
<p>02:40:00<br>I got a question to the health unit which you showed last week. And is it … I built something additionally … is it possible to share, to start the video?<br>上个星期我展示的健康单元有个问题，我做了些附件，可以展示共享吗，视频开始了吗？<br>Mr. Keshe: Yes. Go ahead. We are learning a lot from you. You are very … what you call it … innovative people. Let me see. I have something on my screen.<br>凯史：可以，继续，我们学了不少从你那，你是…，你们怎么说来着…创新者.让我看看有什么在你的视频里。</p>
<p>Is that your portable unit?<br>这是你的轻便单元？<br>Klaus Priller: Yes, this is the …<br>Klaus Priller ：是的<br>Mr. Keshe: I thought, it was genious.<br>凯史：我想，这是个天才设计.<br>Klaus Priller:<br>This was a try to address the single coils the magnetical and the gravitational coils by cone connectors and to make the whole system more modular.<br>这是试验用锥体连接磁引场单线圈使系统更模块化。<br>And this is a part which can be stuck into the helmet cups.<br>这是一个可以嵌入头盔的零件。</p>
<p>And I was looking for a solution to connect the single wires without turning them always together<br>我在寻找一个不用将单线圈拧在一起的解决方案。</p>
<p>and this would be the solution of a cone connector which you can screw a bit in without hurting the nano layers.<br>这个会是一个解决方法你可以把椎体旋进衔接体，而不会破坏纳米层。</p>
<p>And I just have to screw it for a half millimeter and then it holds.<br>我只转了一半，然后定住了。<br>And the question is: This is I would say a very electrical way of seeing a solution.<br>问题是这是看起来一个非常电子（物质）的解决方式。<br>Is there a change in the flow of plasma if I connect the coils like this?<br>如果我像这么连接能转接等离子体磁引力场流么。<br>   Mr. Keshe:<br>No.<br>凯史：不能。<br>But I’m going to put you another … I’m going to throw in the water for you:<br>我给你另外一个…，我给你泼点冷水…<br>You made your inner core and outer core fixed to the body. Ja? That’s the position.<br>你做了内核和外核，是吗？,那个位置。<br>But do you know if you can or you be able to twist and turn any of your coils back and forth, up and down, you can change the field strength much easier and then you can target specific points in the brain of the man.<br>但是你知道吗如果你把前后的线圈扭搓一起，上下的线圈扭搓一起，你就能很容易改变磁场强度，然后就能定位特别的脑部点。<br>At the moment, your coil is fixed to that position, correct?<br>此刻，你的线圈固定到了那个位置，对吗？<br>You glued it, I can see the glue there, ja?<br>你胶住了它，我能看见那里的胶水，是吗？（要灵活可动吧）<br>Klaus Priller: This is the coil for the helmet.<br>Klaus Priller：这是头盔的线圈.<br>Mr. Keshe:Yes, I know. But if you can make the inner coil or outer coil adjustable …<br>凯史：是的，你知道如果让内外核可被调整…<br>You see you still work in the world of matter-state.<br>你看你仍然运行在物质状态。<br>Let me explain to you something.<br>让我解释给你<br>I am going to … Can you stop sharing, I show you, what I mean.<br>我将…你先停一停，我来展示，我的意思是。<br>Just press “not to share” and then I’ll come back to you.<br>按“停止共享”，<br>Ok, what you got to see, you have your coil … this coil this way …<br>好的，你看到的是，你的线圈，这是你的线圈的方式…</p>
<p>and you have that coil this way in it.<br>你的线圈的这种方式。</p>
<p>This coil now … because I told you I teach you as we go further, …<br>现在的线圈…进一步我告诉你…<br>This coil now, this one （the outer coil） is fixed.<br>现在线圈，外核的这个线圈固定。</p>
<p>You can … I am just rotating this （the outer coil） slightly this way …<br>你轻轻地旋转外核圈</p>
<p>If your coil now is this shape, if you understand it, …<br>如果你的线圈现在是这个形状了，要是你明白了它…</p>
<p>and this coil is positioned this shape<br>线圈定位到此外形</p>
<p>Now you can target which part of the brain, instead of generally covering a whole section, …<br>现在你能对准脑的（某）部分，不在覆盖整个脑部。</p>
<p>you can start pinpointing where you want to change.<br>你能准确定位在你想转变的地方。</p>
<p>You understand?明白了？<br>So now that you start building this, try to make it flexible that it can twist and turn and hold in that position. It’s very easy.<br>所以你现在开始做，使其可调，能够很容易地扭搓和定位到那个位置。<br>So when you make the helmets, … When for example you are targeting this part of the brain …<br>当你完成，例如你对着脑的这里…</p>
<p>now you put your present system, when you do this, the field covers this:<br>现在你把你的系统，这么做，磁场盖在这里</p>
<p>You understand?明白？<br>And then if you put another one there, your field covers this …<br>然后你放另一个到这里，磁场罩住这里。</p>
<p>and you are working in this zone, ja?<br>然后你就在作用在了这个区域，是不？</p>
<p>But if you can make one of these flexible the other way, …<br>而且如果你以灵活可调方式做另外这一个（线圈单元）</p>
<p>you can literally pinpoint exactly where you want to work.<br>你能完全对准你想要作用的地方。<br>This gives you more accuracy<br>这能给你更多准确性</p>
<p>Mario Kienappel: Which one of those coils should be flexible?<br>Mario Kienappel：应该让哪个线圈单元灵活可调.<br>Mr. Keshe:Depends … both can be.<br>凯史：两个都可以，取决于…<br>Depends what you’re expecting, what you want to. Are you giving or are you taking?<br>决定于你想干嘛，期望啥，要给予还是获取…<br>Because then you can change, ja?<br>然后你可以去改变<br>And the other thing which you might understand easier:<br>另外一件你可以理解的事是<br>If you look at your coils, the double coils which you do, try to be able …<br>你看你做的两个线圈，试着能够…</p>
<p>This is going more and more getting refining the thing cause you learn, and then you are going to the next one, yeah?<br>这个让你学到的越来越精炼，从而进入下一阶段。<br>That you can control this one , you can control the gravitational and magnetic field of the plasma to each coil.<br>你就能控制单元，你能控制每个线圈的磁引力场</p>
<p>That you can increase this or decrease this . If you are trying to pull something out  or you are trying to give to increase.<br>你能进行增减，如果你想弄些什么出来或试着去增加。<br>If you are trying to get the cancer cell out , what does, how does a cancer cell.<br>You need the gravitational to get stronger than magnetical. Now you control it here.<br>如果你想把癌细胞弄出来，对癌细胞做什么，你需要引力场强过磁力场，现在你调控到这里（有定位？配视频更明白？），<br>If you want to feed, a cell is destroyed, you want to build it, you want to give it to you . So you reduce the energy in  your magnetic （sorry） gravitational, and you increase magnetical.<br>如果你想去供应，一个被破坏受损细胞，你想修建它，你就要给予你自己。让（单元）磁力场强过引力场。<br>So if you are working, try to see if you can refine it much easier . In a way, where I look at the top of your system: You have 4 plugs, you need actually 8 plugs.  And then you can change each one.<br>    You understand ?<br>如果你是在正在着手做，试看是否你能更容易的提升它，我看见你的系统的上面有4个插销，你需要8个（布满圆面），然后你可以转换每一个（旋转线圈到所有插销位置）明白了吗？</p>
<p>Klaus Priller: Yeah, I understand yes.<br>Klaus Priller: 好的，明白<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>This way you go much faster because now you control it, the direction of it.<br>这种方法你有更快的达成，因为有方向性的控制.<br>You decide if it’s a tumor you take energy from it.<br>你来决定，如果有肿块你抽取它的能量。<br>If it’s a damage you try to build it you give enough of it that it can take.<br>如果是受损部位，你给予它足够能量就能修复。<br>Because , the body immediately  knows if it’s receiving or if it’s taking. And then in that respect  when it receives it allows nourishment.  It’s very simple.<br>因为身体立刻是在接受还是在取出,当有接受（能量）就会当作食物（应用）.<br>Klaus Priller:  Ok, adding 4 more connectors wouldn’t be the problem.<br>Klaus Priller: 好，加4个连接（在上部面板）可能会有问题<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yes, that what I saw because you making … I saw this, I saw. I’m monitoring what you are doing in the background. And it’s beautiful  what you as a team are doing. And I think it’s for the German manufacturing team to get on with you Austrians and get this moving off the ground in different way.<br>凯史：是的，我在关注你做的，做的很好，你和你的德国制作组联同澳大利亚方面在各种方式和范围做出了推动。。<br>We announce a lot of changes when we arrive in China. Already have a lot of understanding but what is going to be done in different countries  and different organizations  …. We are trying to make a standby trip on the way to Philippine  or back from China in Philippine. That we can meet with our innovation center people who are the backbone who have all this developed.<br>当我们到了中国后会有些变化，,我们已很明白在哪些国家或组织该怎么做，这次旅程会先去菲律宾或先到中国后再去，会同两地拥有很多开发的中心人员见面。<br>And then we try, we know hopefully  by the time we are back from China we might open one of the biggest research centers in the space in Middle East.<br>我们努力，我们满怀希望从中国回来后建立起一个规模庞大的中东太空研发中心。<br>And I’m sure we’ll receive the positive results very soon . And this will bring all the scientists, world scientists in plasma technology to develop this technology very rapidly. You see,  what I explained in all the teaching . I have thought in every level, as I was explaining that you according to your own intelligence and understanding to take what you are comfortable with.  I haven’t made it exclusive for  one. I told you that nano materials and the GANS that you take if you are happy to be happy to have enough energy just to give you normal life.<br>我们确信我们会收到（充满正能量的）积极结果。我们会带着世界上的所有科学家，等离子科技科学家们飞速开发这种科技。你们看，就像我想过的，解释过给你们的，在所有程度上基于你自身的智慧和理解做让你开心的事，我没有做过区别对待，我告诉过你们，在纳米材料和甘丝上如果你们开心愿意就能得到足够的能量给你的人生。<br>I told you the cores and the GANS cores which we did with the Iranian government.<br>我跟你说过我们和伊朗政府做的核心和甘丝<br>They feel happy now whenever you go there. If you want to go further  you went to the GANS and then you went into the core … where we saw the cores being made and tested.<br>他们无论在哪里都感到开心，如果你进一步到甘丝到核心制作和测试的地方（貌似以前说过开心的房子之类不太记得了，可以补充介绍）。<br>And then we went to the cores  and now we’ve come to use of the interaction of the coils, understanding the core business  that you can go into feeding  and into space.<br>现在我们使用核心的交互作用，理解了核心的作用，你就能进入可持续的太空<br>So whatever you like. There is something in there that you can attach yourself to be, but then you decide what to be.<br>你喜欢怎么样，那么你就将你跟什么东西联系在一起，而不是你决定着什么（人类自我为中心的方式，人总做一切决定，改变其他改变环境改变自己想改变的一切达到以达到目的，而不是跟其他事物从根本上和谐相处）<br>I know not many people will go for what is on the table at the moment.<br>我知道不是很多人在哪个时刻会选择离开<br>But a lot of people who want to leave not to lose their attachment or  the loved ones. When they know that the cancer is imminent, they have so and so many long time, they will choose the option of the space feeding. Because that way they want to guarantee that they stay with their loved ones.<br>很多人想和所爱的人，所依恋的一起离开，当他们知道灾难迫近，他们有很多很多时间？？，他们将选择在太空的可持续生存方式，因为他们想保证和他们的所爱呆在一起。<br>I’ve seen many people the last seconds, the last weeks  or months when they tell them “You’ve got so much to live” … they do everything possible to find a solution.<br>我已经看到最后一月或一星期或最后一刻，当他们被告知“你要顾及的太多了”，他们尽其所能寻找解决方法。<br>Maybe, out of the fear of loss, man finds a solution in the path to the universe.<br>也许，摆脱失去的恐惧，人类才能找到一条通往宇宙之路。<br>Then we see if these people become truly , because they have no choice, they are following the way. But at least they are finding immortality to be with their children and their loved ones.<br>然后我们看到人变得真诚，因为人别无选择，遵循此道，这样才能和他们的孩子和所爱的人才能一起找到永恒<br>This is very strange I always told you. Man will accept this technology out of it’s beauty . Because it’s so beautiful  if you understand it. But accepted out of fear of their own  life. So when you make this system like you made you’ve showed us . Please understand: Cover all possibilities.<br>奇怪的是我的得总是跟你们说，人们不会因为这种科技的美妙而接受，它是如此完美，但是会因自他们生存的恐惧而接受,所以当你这是展示给我们的你做的系统，请理解：尽可能的尝试。（前面就说过是因对死的恐惧而不因技术美妙而接受技术，此处英文貌似有点口误）<br>02:50:00 - 02:55:00<br>That you do not need to be any other way.<br>你不需要其他方法。<br>What is this system, please?<br>请问什么系统？</p>
<p>Klaus Priller:     Ah this is, this is the same for the body part, this is the same trial to, to address the single coils, but also umm just with four err connectors, but these connectors you see here are not coin connectors, because I made it before, and umm, this is the suggestion also to address the single coils at the body part of the Health Unit.<br>Klaus Priller:这也是一个试验部件，定位单线圈,y也是UMM的4个错误连接，我以前做的，貌似可以拿来作为系统的一部分来定位单线圈<br>Mr. Keshe:       Hmm, it’s a very nice advancement.  This is beautiful the way you are operating. You have the German precision, as I call it, and it is beautiful to see your work.<br>凯史：嗯，很好，你做事的方式很有范，有德国式的严谨，就像我说的，看你的做法很漂亮<br>Klaus Priller:     Ok!  The, the, thanks, thanks a lot.  The only question was, because there, the wires are in other directions and they are become more and more wires when we address the single coils, if there is any change in the flow of plasma?  This, this was my only fear.<br>Klaus Priller:谢谢，就是有一个问题，但我们线圈在各种不同方向线圈越来越多，是否有等离子体流向的改变，这是我唯一的疑问。<br>Mr. Keshe:       Not really. No! Not at this level. Not at this level. Not at this level.  Not at this level at all, because the totality decides if it’s going to give and get, not you by the turnings.<br>凯史：并不见得，在这种层面上，因为这完全取决于它是去给予还是获得。<br>Klaus Priller:     Ok! Then thanks a lot, and the next unit we will build more modular in this way.<br>Klaus Priller:好的，非常感谢，下一单元以此方式我们会做的更加模块话。<br>Mr. Keshe:       Wait! Wait! You are not going anywhere. Thank you very much.  Stop!<br>凯史：等等，你不用再去什么地方了？？非常感谢<br>Klaus Priller:     Ok!<br>Klaus Priller:好<br>Mr. Keshe:       How is, how is the woman?<br>凯史：哪个女人呢<br>Klaus Priller:     We started yesterday, ah she set up the helmet the first time yesterday. We set the helmet umm like we, we like you told us in last Thursday. So, we the only thing we changed we didn’t use zinc, as zinc the lead gans, we used salt water instead of it, umm because it was umm our feeling that err, err the lead gans umm isn’t good for the lady.<br>Klaus Priller:我们在昨天开始，她第一次做这个头盔,我们做这UMM头盔，就像你上个星期三告诉我们的。我们唯一改变的是没有用锌，因为锌会导致甘丝产生，我们用的盐水，因为是它UMM，我们感觉会错误的导致甘丝，不适合女士。<br>Mr. Keshe:       Ok! That’s, that’s, we learn from you, we’re all students.<br>凯史：可以，向你学习，我们都是学生。<br>Klaus Priller:     And umm what we did..err we, I don’t have the helmet here, because, because I am not in the lab now, err she had it on her head, last, yesterday the first time.  We addressed three coils, umm as you told us on last Thursday, and we only used the gravitational coils, and umm we connected to the coil, which is directly above the, the umm tumour with the zinc for which we used salt water.<br>Klaus Priller:我们做的UMM，错误的那个？没在这儿，因为我不在实验室里，她把错误的UMM带着头上！昨天，第一次我们安了3个线圈，跟你上星期三说的一样，我们只用了引力圈，在UMM上连接线圈直接正对肿瘤部位，用的盐水替代锌。<br>And we connected two batteries to the coils away from the umm from the tumour and one with the coil, which was directly above the tumour.<br>我们连接了两个电池（电容）到线圈到到UMM到肿瘤？？？！（无图不明白），一个连线圈，在上方正对肿瘤。<br>Mr. Keshe:       You will see how we go.  There are some developments from China, which shows the technology works very well for tumours.  We hopefully do.<br>凯史：你将看到我们去中国的时候，哪里开发一些新产品对肿瘤很有效。<br>Ah! I’ve got to tell you one thing:<br>我还要告诉你一件事<br>The two or three weeks we are in China, the teaching will carry on the same time. We will not change, but this time we’ll do it with the Chinese Keshe Foundation group, and we will try to keep to the same procedure. When we travel, we only keep to the Thursday’s teaching, not the Tuesday teaching, you can do the workshop as Keshe Foundation, as you do, but on Thursdays we’ll join you in the teaching sessions. So, we keep the teaching sessions wherever we travel and whenever we travel anywhere we carry the system with us.  So we join you from China, and if we are in other countries it will be the same.<br>2到3个星期后我们在中国，教学还是在同一个时间，我们不会改变，只是这次和中国团队在一起，保持同样的进程，中国旅行中我们保持星期四的教学，而不是星期二，你可以像现在这样计划工作，星期四将你加入教学课程，我们保持教学时段不变，不论我们在何时何地，不论在中国还是别的国家。<br>Thank you very much!<br>非常感谢<br>Klaus Priller:    Thanks a lot to you!<br>Klaus Priller:多谢<br>Mr. Keshe:       Thank you very much<br>Any other questions?  Or shall we call it a day, we’ve gone nearly three hours.<br>凯史：还有其他问题吗，结束本次么，大约3个小时了。<br>We gave a lot of knowledge today.  If those who understood it you have become the man of the space as of this week.<br>我们获得了不少知识，如果你理解了在这次就已经成为了一个宇宙人了。<br>Q&amp;A Candy Parker - Pacemaker &amp; Give before you take<br>02:54:30<br>Candy Parker: I have a question!<br>Candy Parker:我有个问题<br>Mr.  Keshe:      Yes?<br>Candy Parker:   This is Candy Parker from Florida.  I’m an acupuncture physician and I have a couple of patients that have pacemakers and I know that I have to be very careful with them with the acupuncture.  I thought I remember hearing you say that we couldn’t use health patches or pens on them because of the electrons, or it might steal an electron or something from the pacemakers?<br>我是佛罗里达人,针灸师，我有很多有装有起搏器的病人，我知道得非常小心的对他们用针灸，我记得你说过止痛带或医疗笔不能对他们用，因为电子的原因，或许会摄取起搏器电力。<br>Mr. Keshe:       You can use the plasma systems, there is no problem.<br>凯史：你可以用等离子体系统就不会有问题<br>Candy Parker: Oh good! Thank You!<br>Candy Parker:谢谢<br>Another thing is I want to put the patches underneath the sheet on the table  where I’m treating them.<br>另外一个问题，我把止痛带贴到他们的床单下治疗他们…<br>Keshe: That is the plasma. The systems, the Magrav system you can use. The patches you can’t.<br>凯史：是等离子体系统的才行，磁引力场系统可以使用，止痛带不行（证明止痛带这种贴片方式跟线圈方式的有区别，线圈组合才能产生完整的等离子体磁引力场系统，对物质电子层面的起搏器没有直接作用，止痛带有磁性可惜跟磁铁吸引，线圈组合则没有传统磁铁效果）<br>C: What about the “Cup of Life”? Can I drink from  the “Cup of Life” with GANS in it ?<br>Candy Parker:圣杯是什么，我能喝有甘丝的圣杯的水么<br>K: Give them the machine. It’s easier.<br>凯史：给他们用医疗机，很简单的<br>C: Ok, so they can not ….<br>Candy Parker:好的..那么<br>K: You see one of the ways I’ve found out with all the health people is when you, especially, have a pace maker  or you have a condition like a heart condition. Take the system near to the heart , don’t put It on it ! They tell you if they feel it or not. Then you know if you are interfering with it or not. You understand ?<br>凯史：你看，所有有类似起搏器的或心脏病的病人，把医疗机系统靠近他们的心脏，不要接触，他们告诉你感觉，已以此方式你再根据情况处理，明白？<br>C: Yes好的</p>
<p>K: If you for example take the patch near the heart . They tell you, my heart is going faster  or whatever.  You know you interfere. Then you stay out of it.<br>凯史：如果你用止痛带靠近他们心脏，他们说心跳加快或其他什么状况，你就得停止。<br>C: With the “Cup of Life” I know that there is some different ways of making it but it does have some GANS in it. What if there was just the nano coated copper. Would that be enough for them to be ….<br>Candy Parker:圣杯有很多方法制作，有甘丝在里面，是否只是纳米铜，对他们足够…<br>K: It’s the same, but if you put water by accident, got some salt in it, becomes GANS based.<br>凯史：一样的，但是如果你放水，就放盐水，成为甘丝基础？？（圣杯这几句要结合以往信息量，了解不够多不太清楚，需修改）<br>C: Ok<br>Candy Parker:好的<br>K:  The best way to use the “Cup of Life” if you are giving to someone is to put a glass .. or a … what I used to do is just give them these 330 ml  water bottles . Drinking bottles.<br>凯史：给他人使用圣杯的最好方法，就是把（圣杯的水）倒进玻璃杯，喝水，我做的就是放330毫升水。<br>C: Yes<br>Candy Parker:好的<br>K : I find that is the best thing to put in the cup.  And they drink it and then put it back in again.<br>凯史：最好的方法倒水进杯子里，然后去喝，喝完再倒（圣杯的水倒其他杯子里）<br>C: Oh, Ok<br>Candy Parker:好的<br>K: So you can use one cup for many people bacause they bring their own bottles.<br>凯史：那么你能使用一个圣杯，给很多自带杯子的人喝<br>C: How long does it take to charge the water ? Or change the water.<br>Candy Parker:多长时间换一次水？<br>K: How long ? There’s no charging. You transfer plasma.  And if you listen  to the teachings from this morning and Tuesday. The minute they felt that they want an  icecream, they had the  icecream!<br>凯史：多长？这里没有什么补充时间，如果你听了星期二早上的教学，他们如果想要冰淇淋的味道马上就有。<br>You think this is any different ?<br>你认为这里有什么不同？<br>C: Ok, I get it now. I did listen  to the teaching. I did. Ok. Thank you very much.<br>Candy Parker:好的，我懂了，我没听教学，非常感谢<br>K: You’re welcome.<br>Any other question ?<br>凯史：你客气了，还有其他问题？<br>Rick: Mr Keshe, there is a question from  Dennis that he wanted to have brought up … ah … regarding his question, he want to know what we could give our self-made Magrav system  to help it evolve the way that it was to evolve rather than what we expect from it.  In other words how ???bit??? to become what it want’s to be?<br>RICK:凯史先生，dennis有个问题，他想带来……。有关他的问题，他想知道我们能够给我们的自制磁引力场系统，帮组它提升并超过我们对它的期望，<br>K: I think we answered that  in earlier part. Before you start taking from it give to it what you don’t need.<br>凯史：我想这个问题我在先前哪部分回答过，开始之前，你给它你不需要的<br>This means when  …. This is the part which  we never  discussed that  you’ll have … you … If you give you receive. That’s so when you  if you understand this from the early part teachings from this morning. You understand that you give.  And then the system  gives what you need.<br>意思是当……这点我们没有讨论过，你将有……如果你给与你有的，当你明白了早上的先前部分的教学，就会明白你给予（系统），然后系统给予你想要的。<br>Because when you give,  the system see’s “I have these. This are the one’s I don’t have or I don’t need”. So you give some or you get back because you are already satisfied what is short of.<br>因为当你给予，系统就在想：“我有了这些，这些是我没有的，或我不需要的”，如此你给予什么此后你得到反馈，那么你的需求就会被满意。<br>You receive what is not short of.<br>你得到了你要的<br>So that’s why you receive it , because it’s there.  So, if you understand it, is that you give and THEN you receive.  You don’t take and go to the table and say There it is.  There is not on  the table if you don’t bring something on it for the others to share.  And this is where the change is.  Where the difference will come.<br>    所以那就是为什么你收到，因为它就在哪里，如果你明白，当你给予然后你就会收到反馈，你不能走近一个桌子说上面有东西（去享用吧），因为如果你不给予（系统）那么这个所谓的桌子也就不会有什么东西给其他人去享用，这就是改变的之处，这就是将要到来的不同的地方（不同于传统需求摄取的方式）<br>The system will change according to what you want because you are the creator of it.<br>这个系统取决与你想要什么，因为你是系统的制作者。<br>Any other question ?<br>还有其他问题?(想下课了……问的真多)<br>Q&amp;A: Mossim - Frequencies, Music and Noise Viruses<br>问题：有关病毒，音乐、噪音的<br>Mossim: Mr Keshe  Can you hear me ?<br>Mossim:凯史先生能听见我么？<br>K: Yes<br>凯史：可以<br>Mossim:  Mr Keshe, my name is Mossim I am from United States of America,<br>San Jose, California.<br>Mossim:我叫Mossim，美国佬，来自加利福利亚，圣何塞，<br>I am an Iranian man and I just wanna tell you that I am proud student of Keshe foundation for the last  2 years.  And I celebrate that my  2 years student of the Keshe a few days ago.<br>我是伊朗人，刚刚从2年制的凯史基金的学校毕业。<br>03:00:00<br>I want to tell you that as an Iranian American I am proud to have you as my master and the teacher. I want to thank you for all the humanitarian ideas that you have for the whole world and I’d like to be the first Iranian student to thank you in Farsi language if I make this??? (03:00:34)<br>我想说作为一个伊朗籍美国佬，我非常骄傲能够有你作为我的导师，我想谢谢你对世界的博爱，我想做为第一个用伊朗语感谢的伊朗学生，如果我能这样？？<br>Mr. Keshe: Go ahead.<br>凯史：呵呵继续<br>（ 03:00:38 - 03:03:06<br>Sorry, no English. It’s an Arabic or Persian dialect. But sounds like an anthem about thankfulness ）<br>对不起（听众了），因为不是英语，是一种阿拉伯或波斯方言，像感恩的赞美诗。</p>
<p>第七部分<br>03:03:06<br>Mossim:<br>I want to thank you again for everything, Mr. Keshe.<br>I just have a question:<br>And I like to have your opinion but I’m sure you have already experienced this.<br>What I did at the time I was making my GANS I used certain frequencies. I actually have a device that was tuning my guitar, my electronic guitar. So I just simply left that device right next to the container where I was making my GANS. And the GANS that I was making my purpose was for health and helping other people.<br>The thing is that my pain-pen to me is very strong and it definitely has a different effect.<br>I personally used it and I feel ice-cold feeling when I use it. I use it on my knee I had some knee problem. And it is very amazing that using frequency makes any difference.<br>Did I make any kind of an infinity loop? I call it “second infinity loop” on the GANS?</p>
<p>03:03:06<br>Mossim:<br>我想为这一切再次感谢凯史先生。<br>我有一个问题：<br>且我很乐意听听您的意见，但是我肯定您已经经历过这个情况。<br>在我制作甘斯时我使用了某个频率。实际上我有一个装置是给吉他调音的，是我的电吉他。所以我只是正好把那个装置留在制作甘斯的容器旁边。而我制作甘斯的目的就是为了健康和帮助其他人。<br>事情是这样的：我的止痛笔对我而言感觉非常强烈，且它肯定有一个不同的效果。<br>我亲自使用它且使用时感到冷冰冰的感觉。我在膝盖上使用它因为我膝盖有点毛病。而令人惊奇的是使用频率产生了一些不同效果。<br>是我产生了某种无限循环吗？我称之为甘斯的“第二无限循环”。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:<br>Almost probably what you’ve done: You connected the GANS to the matter-state.<br>This is something which we as human being receive as “music”.<br>Why we are attached to music and we all love, doesn’t matter what it is.<br>03:05:00<br>Because we eat food to connect with our physicality.<br>We breath air because it connects to our what you call it feeding of our emotion.<br>Sound and the music is another structure which is non-tangible and it connects to our plasma.<br>That’s why we all enjoy music. It’s another way of receiving energy.<br>凯史先生：<br>你所做的是有可能的：你连接了甘斯和物质态。<br>这是我们人类接收“音乐“的一种方式。<br>这就是为什么我们都重视音乐并热爱它，并不管它是什么。<br>03:05:00<br>因为我们吃东西来连接我们的身体。<br>我们呼吸空气因为它连接到我们情感上的供给。<br>声音和音乐是另一种结构，它无法触摸且连接了我们的等离子体。<br>那就是为什么我们享受音乐。这是另一种接收能量的方式。</p>
<p>So what you’ve done: You’ve done exactly that as we do with the human body. You transferred the matter-state which is the noise of it into the plasma of the man.<br>And that’s why it worked that way.<br>You understand?<br>This another level of noise or what we call music, vibration. It doesn’t matter how we create it because it can not be eaten or breathed in but it still has a strength. It get’s attached to or used by the what you call the GANS body of the man.<br>This is what I say, this is part of the energy absorption of our body which man has never understood. Music is what you call the feed because it’s a matter-state vibration of the element to the plasmatic condition when it converts back in.<br>But because it’s in a strength of a plasma itself because it has no matter-strength is … goes to us directly. We receive in our GANS-state very quickly.<br>所以你所做的：你所做的正是我们人体所做的。你转移了物质态的声音到人类的等离子体。<br>且那是它以那种方式运行的原因。<br>你理解了吗？<br>这是另一个级别的声音或者我们称它为音乐，振动。我们怎么产生它并不重要因为它既不能食用也不能呼吸，但是它仍然有一个力量。<br>它被附在或者用在我们人类的甘斯体上。<br>这就是我所说的，这是我们人类吸收能量的一部分，这个人类还不能理解。音乐是我们称之为食物的东西，因为它是一种元素的物质态的振动到等离子体条件的转换。<br>但是因为它处在等离子体强度，因为它没有物质强度…它是直接影响我们的。在甘斯态时我们可以非常快的接收到。</p>
<p>This is why if you remember when I speak about the Alzheimer’s (03:06:55) especially is because we understand this why music or vibration is so important.<br>And the only question we ask them is: “Do you … or can you sing a tune, a music?”<br>Because if they have done or they can do, it means, they are still connected to the creation of the physicality. But without them knowing, we open the channel.<br>This is why … it’s like we say if you eat banana, are you ???alleged??? (03:07:36) to it?<br>You say “Yes” or “No”.<br>If you say you breath the air which is got a bit moisture, you ???cuff??? (03:07:44)<br>如果你记得的话，这也是我们特别提到老年痴呆症的原因，因为我们理解了音乐或者振动为什么这么重要。<br>且我们问他们的唯一问题是：“你能发一个音调或者唱一个乐曲吗？“<br>因为如果他们已经这么做或者能够这么做，这意味着，他们仍然连接到肉体的创造。但是他们不知道，我们打开了这个通道。<br>这是为什么…它就像我们说的，如果你在吃香蕉，你能???它吗？(03:07:36)<br>你说 “YES”或者”NO”.<br>如果你说你呼吸空气而空气有些潮湿，你??? (03:07:44)</p>
<p>Music is the same thing but it’s a food, it’s an energy transfer for the body of the man which still touches the same as the food you eat or the banana you eat, you remember the taste of the banana what you need for it.<br>This is why we go for specific musics in a specific structure of the emotion. If you are happy, we go for certain things.<br>And then we see the cultures go the same way. The cultures, according to their music stays the condition of their emotion.<br>We see with the youth. How the culture across the world is becoming ONE. More or less the new generation are the first generation of man which already become ONE Planet people. Because they share all the same music.<br>音乐是同样的道理但是它也是一种食物，它对于身体是一种能量转换，这就和人吃食物一样，你吃香蕉能够记得你所需要的香蕉的味道。<br>这是为什么我们在一个情感的特定结构中寻求特定的音乐。如果你是快乐的，我们要寻求某种事物。<br>然后我们可以看到文化也是相同的方式。文化就是按照他们的音乐来保持他们情感的条件。<br>我们来看看年轻人。跨越世界的文化是怎样变为一体的。现在的新生代差不多是第一代成为一个星球的人类，因为他们分享相同的音乐。</p>
<p>So but music is more effective （to） direct energy to the GANS than is the food or the air.<br>So, what you’ve done: You transferred part of the physicality of the GANS you use on your pen which means directly receives. It depends what that music does to you when you tuned it.<br>Do you find happiness or do you give forgiveness or you find pleasure with it?<br>You have to understand what that tuning was to do with your physicality. Because you got a GANS on your copper wire which is in a layer, you don’t see because you think it’s only nano material. So you have created that condition according to what that condition gives to your emotion.<br>所以音乐对于甘斯而言是比食物或者空气更直接有效的能量。<br>所以，你所做的：你转换了你使用的笔上的甘斯的一部分物质，这样就直接吸收了。它依赖于你调试吉他时所产生的音乐。<br>你感到高兴了吗？或者你给予宽恕了吗？或者你感到愉悦了吗？<br>你必须理解你的调音与你的身体是有关系的。因为你在你的铜线上得到了甘斯，你不能看到是因为你认为它只是纳米材料。所以你已经创造了一个条件，这个条件可以提供给你情感。</p>
<p>You have to see … repeat the what you call it the vibration you had in your tuner and then change it to a music and see what that music gives you. And that music, whatever it gives you, is the feeling, you had on your leg.<br>Connection between the music and the GANS-state of matter, we never speaked about, because it’s very, very delicate. Because you can use it to add, you don’t change, but you add to it.<br>03:10:00<br>Some of the viruses in the universe come in the form of music, in the form of noise.<br>And these are extremely, extremely hard to release.<br>They are viruses, they are literally noise viruses, it’s unknown on this planet but in the space you come across it.<br>你必须看到…重复你在调音时产生的振动，然后将它变为一段音乐，再看看那段音乐会带给你什么。那段音乐无论带给你什么，你在你的腿上都会有一种感觉。<br>在音乐和甘斯态物质之间的连接，我们从来没提到，因为它太微妙了。因为你能够用它来添加，你不能改变它但是可以增加。<br>03:10:00<br>在宇宙中一些病毒以音乐的形式出现，也会以一种声音的形式出现。<br>而这些是极端难以排出的。<br>它们是病毒，它们是声音病毒，在这里是未知的，但是在宇宙中你会碰到。</p>
<p>It’s which is they add the energy exactly like virus to the GANS of the amino-acid. And then finding it is god’s hell. Because it’s undetectable and then you have to find the level of noise. And then you have to find out in what way has it attached itself to do it.<br>There is a way you can do reverse it, but that is … it needs a special technique you got to it within yourself. You have to find out where it’s come, where it sits. These noises then they go into your body and it’s horrendous if it’s not done. Because you absorb it in a way which is already digested form.<br>And this is one of the biggest problems in the space. What I call viruses, space viruses, the noise virus is the worst one. It’s one of the worst one for any creature not just man.<br>这就是他们把能量就像病毒加到氨基酸的甘斯中。<br>然后发现它是神的地狱。因为它是无法检测到的，而你必须找到声音的级别。然后你必须找到它是以什么方式被加进去的。<br>有一种方式你能够逆转它，但那是…它需要一种在你自己身上获得的特殊的技术。你必须找到它从哪里来的，它藏在哪里。这些声音然后进入你的身体，如果没经过测试它是非常可怕的。因为你是以一种消化的方式来吸收它的。<br>这是在宇宙中最主要的问题之一。我称之为病毒，宇宙病毒，声音病毒是最坏的一种。它对于任何生物不只是人类都是最坏的一种病毒。</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time.<br>Any other question?<br>We have, … let me explain. We have a gentleman with us in our … what you call it One-Year Course, Mr. Achaban（???）, we have a lot of fun with him regarding poetry of the Farsi and how we apply it in the space technology. He is from ???space group??? (03:11:55).<br>Carry on, please.<br>Any other question or we call it the day?<br>非常感谢你。<br>还有其他问题？我们<br>我们有…让我解释一下。我们有位先生在我们的课程里…我们叫一年课程，Achaban先生，我们和他关于波斯语的诗以及这些诗如何被用在空间技术上有很多开心的事情。他来自空间组??? (03:11:55)<br>请继续。<br>还有其他问题？或者我们今天就结束了？</p>
<p>Rick: Seems like you might want to call it the day here Mr. Keshe. Maybe we could go on probably forever （??? … ???）. But let me see if there is anything …<br>Here is one person wanted to know if the system … “Will the feeding device help to stop smoking?”<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>If it’s your desire, you ask for a smoke … you receive it and then you don’t need it. Yes, it does!<br>Rick: 看上去你今天想要结束了，凯史先生，也许我们大概可以一直继续下去???。但是让我看一下是不是还有什么事情…<br>这里有个人想知道是否系统…“供给装置是否帮助戒烟？”<br>凯史先生：<br>如果这是你的愿望，你请求一根烟…你接收它然后你不需要它，是的，它可以帮助你！</p>
<p>Rick: Certainly Douglas has results on using his health cup … helped him to stop smoking.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yes, but depends （on） what you do. We’ve done drug addiction is under investigation the same way.<br>We are using the pen which was sent to us by Armond in the States.<br>Rick:道格拉斯关于用他的健康杯肯定已经有结果了…帮他戒烟。<br>凯史先生：<br>是的，但是这取决于你所做的。我们已经在研究对于毒瘾的测试了。<br>我们已经使用美国的Armond发给我们的笔来测试。</p>
<p>Armond! I just remembered yesterday, last night in bed that I forgot to send you the payment for your shipping. I do apologize. I’ve just so much going on in my head … I just remembered.<br>So that the two pens you sent us here they are under observation, they are going through the … what you call it … One is just getting used for drug addiction and one is getting used for diabetics.<br>And we are waiting for the French and Americans to report their finding.<br>But we … because we had two, we agreed with the French and Americans that they do the diabetic. We do all diabetic, we come back most probably next two or three weeks.<br>Armond! 我昨天晚上在床上才想起来，我忘记给你寄运费了。我道歉，我脑袋里记的事情太多…我刚想起来啊。<br>你发给我们的两个笔它们正在被观察，他们需要仔细检查…你所说的…一个被用于毒瘾测试。一个被用于糖尿病测试。<br>且我们正在等法国人和美国人报告他们的发现。<br>但是因为我们有两支，我们和法国人和美国人一起来测试糖尿病。我们做所有的糖尿病测试，大概再过2-3周我们就回来了。</p>
<p>But now we use one of the pens you sent us for drug addiction. We give a full result. It’s done by doctors, it’s not just ??? man ??? (03:13:58)<br>We are taking test, but test everything on a regular basis<br>You can do in so many ways I used these things for even if you’re addicted to medicine, to certain medicines. You try to understand using the system that you receive it without actually itself and then you decide “I don’t want to have it” and the body will find it’s parallel system for it.<br>The addictions, any kind of addiction is reversible now.<br>It’s You, who have to really want it to do it through your emotional part.<br>Any other question?<br>Shall we call it the day?<br>但是现在我们用你发给我们的一支笔做毒瘾测试。我们做一个全面测试。这是由医生来做的，这不是由某个人做的??? (03:13:58)<br>我们正在测试，但是要定期测试所有结果。<br>如果你对某个药物上瘾，你可以用我使用这些东西的很多方式来测试。你可以试着理解你使用这个系统来接收它但是实际上没有这个药物，然后你决定“你不想要它了”，然后你的身体将找到它的并联系统。<br>上瘾即任何东西的上瘾现在是可以消除的。<br>这是你要通过你的情感部分来确定想要真的去除它。<br>还有其他问题？<br>我们今天可以结束了？</p>
<p>1P1N1R Conference in Dubai<br>03:15:00<br>Sylvester:<br>Sorry Mr. Keshe, this is Sylvester, just one quick question: I receiving so many interests<br>from medical experts who would like to participate in our plasma healing center. What would be the proper communication channel<br>Me. Keshe:<br>When we are ready, we announced this before, we put <a href="mailto:medical@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical@keshefoundation.org</a><br>And then we already have found, we have appointed the Iranian doctor of well-known reputation in the Middle East to head the Keshefoundation Medical. And then they will decide what to do. He’s a very well-known internationally doctor. We know him for the work around the Keshefoundation and I’ve already asked him to head the Keshefoundation Health Hospital which we hopefully have in our position soon. And then they will invite you in.<br>Sylvester: Thank you.<br>在迪拜一个地球一个国家一个种族会议<br>03:15:00<br>希尔维斯特：<br>对不起，凯史先生，我是希尔维斯特，就一个很短的问题：我收到很多医疗专家的关注，他们希望参与我们的等离子体康复中心。我应该使用哪种适当的通讯方式？<br>凯史先生：<br>当我们准备好，我们以前宣布过的，我们将使用<a href="mailto:medical@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">medical@keshefoundation.org</a>这个邮箱且我们已经开始用了，我们已经任命一位在中东负有声望的伊朗医生来领导凯史基金会医疗组织。他们将决定要做什么。他是一个非常出名的国际医生。我们知道他在凯史基金会附近工作，我们已经请求他来领导凯史基金会康复医院，我们希望不久就在我们这里成立这家医院，然后他们将邀请你也加入。<br>希尔维斯特：谢谢你。</p>
<p>Me. Keshe:<br>The process is going, … we have a lot of … we know there are a lot of doctors who want to do.<br>Allow us to do … most probably we come to an agreement with the Chinese government to open one of the biggest health centers in China for research and development of new technology.<br>凯史先生：<br>进程正在继续，…我们已经有很多…我们知道有很多医生想要加入。<br>请允许我们做…很可能我们和中国政府达成协议在中国建立其中一个最大的医疗中心以研究和开发新技术。<br>We know they already have a center for this work.<br>They are doing work on the background of these partially and totally in some cases using our technology.<br>So in the next 4 or 6 weeks, we make a lot of announcements. Let us come back from China. Don’t forget the Dubai Conference is still on. You got to make your booking as fast as possible. We have reduced the numbers drastically for security reasons.<br>And by advice of our securities we have relocated the hotel. The hotel has moved to a new but very safe. One of the most top ??? delicious ??? (03:16:42) hotels in Dubai.<br>我们知道他们已经有一个中心在做这方面工作。<br>他们正在从事的这些工作部分或全部是基于我们的技术的。<br>所以在接下来的4到6周，等我们从中国回来后我们将发布很多公告。不要忘了迪拜会议还在继续准备着。你应该尽可能快的进行预定了。我们因为安全原因已经大幅减少了参加人员数量。<br>经过我们的安保人员建议我们已经重新预定了酒店。酒店已经换成新的且非常安全，是在迪拜最美丽的酒店。 (03:16:42) ？？？</p>
<p>If you came here just to be in what I call Atlantis Hotel, you wanna refund. We refund you, we have no problem. But if you are coming to be as part of the change in the ONE Planet ONE World Conference, we have still put you in one of the most beautiful hotels with a full security which does not put us in danger.<br>Because the “Red Circle” （??? and his followers/ontorage ???） (03:17:08) in Germany were planning funny things and we have found out, what erupt.<br>This guy will not give up. So you still can go to the Keshefoundation website and please make your booking because very soon we close the booking.<br>如果你来到这里还是住进了亚特兰蒂斯酒店的话，你可能想要退款，我们将退还给你，这个没有问题。但是如果你要参加一个地球一个世界会议的话，我们还是要请你住到这个最美丽的安全的酒店中，因为这不会让我们很危险。<br>因为 “红圆圈”（？？？他的随从/ontorage） (03:17:08) 在德国正在计划一些有趣的事情，我们发现有什么事情爆发了。???<br>这个家伙是不会放弃的。所以你仍然能够到凯史基金会网站去预定，不过我们很快就要关闭预定页面了。</p>
<p>Rick: How do people get confirmation of their booking and so and some people are asking …<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>If you have not received anything that there is something wrong, you are ok.<br>If we see something wrong, we come back to you.<br>The security team in the background headed by Bratt is responsible for it, they are working on it.<br>Don’t forget: The securities got a lot of things, works going in with the students, new students with 100€. We have the manufacturers. We have the Foundations. We have the Conference.<br>And then in the coming time we have a lot of other things we shall adding on. They are working, they are checking.<br>It’s the job of Bratt, who heads the security of the Keshefoundation with the help with the other National Securities and other people we get in different directions.<br>瑞克：<br>人们怎么确认他们是否预定成功？这里有人在问…<br>凯史先生：<br>如果你还没有收到任何信息表明预定有问题，那就表明预定没问题。<br>如果我们看到有问题的话，我们会回来告诉你。<br>在幕后Bratt领导的安全团队在负责这个事情，他们正在忙着这个事情呢。<br>不要忘记：安全包括很多事情，这个工作有很多学生参与，一个新学生有100欧元。???我们也有制造商，还有基金会和会议的事情。<br>在会议即将开始的时候我们还有很多事情要做。他们还在进行着，也在进行检查。<br>这是Bratt的工作，在其他国家安全人员和不同方面人员的协助下，他领导着凯史基金会的安全工作。</p>
<p>Mario Kienappel: Is there any more information about the flights?<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Go to the website the connection there … get your flight, but if you need advice or help, …<br>We had the guy with us yesterday, he says he hasn’t received many （requests for help）.<br>The email is on the website. Get in touch with them if you can’t organize your flight.<br>We very soon will close the numbers down, because now we’ve been gone into the 750€ per person and the hotels are very, very limited.<br>Mario Kienappel:有任何其他关于航班的信息吗？<br>凯史先生：<br>去网站的链接看看…找到你的航班，如果你需要建议或者帮助的话。…<br>我们这里昨天有个人说他没有收到很多需要帮助的信息。…<br>邮件就在网站上。如果你不能找到你的航班请联系他。<br>我们不久就要关闭这个页面了，因为现在我们是每个人750美元，酒店的房间数量非常有限。</p>
<p>Because we are monitoring it’s not an easy job to do. The security is paramount for us and we have moved for this reason the Presentation, the two Presentations into one of the most beautiful hotels again in Dubai.<br>There are so many … Life here is different than what we knew.<br>And I don’t wish but I if would have come here some years ago we most probably with a different direction to do with Keshefoundation.<br>But we are very highly security conscious and we have brought in detectors from the National Offices any chemical detectors everything is available here.<br>We are not leaving any holes open in any shape of form.<br>We work directly … we inform directly and the security will be at the highest level even ???forced??? (03:19:49) than we ever seen ourselves.<br>This is for you lot, not for us.<br>And we know: These people don’t go down without kicking. So we are watching for their kicks.<br>因为我们在监督，它不是一个容易的事情。安全对于我们是最重要的，为了这个原因我们已经换了地点，这两个地方都是迪拜最美丽的酒店之一了。<br>有许多…这里的生活和我们所知道的是不一样的。<br>但是我并不希望这样，如果我几年前就来到这里，我们在凯史基金会的工作很可能就是另一个样子了。<br>但是我们非常有安全意识，我们已经从国家办事处带来了一些探测器，在这里任何东西比如化学探测器都能得到。<br>我们不能有任何形式的漏洞。<br>我们直接工作…直接告知，安全是最高级别的甚至是强制的，我们也检查我们自己。<br>这是为了你们，而不是为了我们。<br>我们知道：这些人没有获得什么是不会消失的，所以我们在监控他们。？？？</p>
<p>03:20:00<br>We moved the hotel from Atlantis to another destination within the Dubai city, extremely beautiful, extremely tranquil. And all everything is signed and we thank the officers of Atlantis Hotel for collaboration and allowing us to move so late in their position of the hotel.<br>我们把酒店从亚特兰蒂斯换到迪拜的另一个酒店，也是非常漂亮，非常安静的。所有一切都是签好的。我们感谢亚特兰帝斯酒店的官员的合作，他们允许我们很晚再搬走。<br>Any other question?<br>Just book your ticket, if you can’t find it, go to the link which we have given and they respond to you immediately. They told us how many received.<br>They received 2-3 inquiries from the Philippines, from Thailand, from China, from United States and they briefed us yesterday.<br>Anybody who has … And if you don’t get a response, it means: Your email has gone somewhere ???straight???. Repeat it again, they respond to you, they put a team to support this.<br>And then we use Dubai as the center for all our conferences from now on the way we set it up because we can control a lot of traffic that is not the same with other countries.<br>（ Obviously someone asked a question we can not here in the video ）<br>Send one to <a href="mailto:webmaster@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webmaster@keshefoundation.org</a>, we pass it on to them. But they tell us: From the day when you used （it） they checked their spam-box, they said. There were two in the spam-box.<br>They put a team to support this event. They run the whole event for us.<br>（ Obviously someone asked a question we can not here in the video ）<br>有任何其他问题吗？<br>赶快预定你的票，如果你不能发现它，就到我们已经发布的链接上，他们会立即回应你的。他们会告诉我们收到多少预定。<br>他们收到来自菲律宾、泰国、中国和美国的2-3个咨询，他们昨天向我们汇报了。<br>有人还有问题的话…如果你没有得到回应的消息，这意味着：你的邮件可能直接被扔到了什么地方？再回复一下，他们会给你回应，他们有一个团队专门做这个。<br>我们选迪拜作为我们所有会议的中心，因为我们可以控制人流量，这和别的国家不同。<br>（显然有人问了问题我们这里看不到。）<br>给<a href="mailto:webmaster@keshefoundation.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webmaster@keshefoundation.org</a>发邮件，我们会转给他们。但是他们告诉我们：当你用这个邮箱时他们检查垃圾信箱，有2个在垃圾信箱里。<br>他们用一个团队来解决这个事情。他们为我们处理整个事情。<br>（显然有人问了问题我们这里看不到。）</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it’s there. Just there because they know the cheapest flights, you can do it yourself! There is no exclusivity.<br>But we limit the numbers very quickly.<br>Because we moved from Atlantis for security reasons, so we made a lot of changes. But it stays the way it is.<br>Don’t forget that we arrive in China hopefully on 25th of March and we are in China until the 11th of February （April）. This is what the plan is. And there are a number of events that had been set up by the group who’s invited us to China.<br>They come up with a genius way to sell tickets for presentation. When I saw it, I just … I could not believe it how they’ve done it. They are following a National Policy. If it is correct, they are following their leadership orders of National Policy of the science in conjunction with the government and private section.<br>哦，是的，它在这里。因为他们知道最便宜的机票，你也可以自助，这个没有限制。<br>但是我们很快就要限制人数了。<br>因为我们出于安全原因从亚特兰蒂斯搬走了，我们做了很多改变，但是保持了这种方式。<br>不要忘了我们希望在3月25号到达中国，直到4月11号都在中国。这是计划的一部分。有很多事情是由邀请我们到中国的团队在做。<br>他们提出一个聪明的方式来销售中国会议的票。当我看到它时，我简直不敢相信他们是怎么做到的。他们在遵循国家政策。如果这是正确的，他们在听从政府和民间组织共同联合的科学的国家政策的领导。？？？<br>And it’s beautiful what they’ve done.<br>We explain to it when we know it’s 100% done. Then you understand. It’s the most genius way I’ve seen to organize a conference. And at the same time everybody which joins a conference becomes part of the owner of the Keshefoundation Manufacturing. It’s amazing what they’ve done.<br>Let us see when it comes. Liza wrote to me recently and I’m just going to watch to see if it’s done.<br>（ Obviously someone asked a question we can not here in the video ）<br>他们做的事情很漂亮。<br>当我们知道已经确定完成时我们再解释，然后你就能理解了。这是我所看到的非常聪明的组织会议的方式。同时所有参加会议的人都会成为凯史基金会制造商的会员，他们所做的令人惊奇。<br>让我们拭目以待。丽萨(PL)最近写信给我，我将去看一下组织会议的工作是否已经完成。<br>（显然有人问了问题我们这里看不到。）</p>
<p>What do you mean?<br>The Dubai Conference still stays in Dubai. But we have moved out of Atlantis Hotel for security reasons. We move the Conference to another location, another hotel where is more secure but is as beautiful as Atlantis. If you are coming here to go to Atlantis, and the Conference was something on the side, we refund you.<br>But if you’re coming to the Conference, you come to Dubai for the Conference, you can still stay in the same … what we call it we’ve taken … when you at the hotel accomodation to another location due to security.<br>So the Conference is going, still the same, but in a different location because these what I call “Red Circles” they are doing their last kick, they literally brought and they showed us what they’re up to in the background from security.<br>We have moved. You come to Dubai three days before your arrival because it’s not very far, it’s only 4-5 km from the Atlantis Hotel. You’ll be notified of the address.<br>We are putting buses in order to pick you up if you come in a mass, in large numbers together that we accommodate for your arrival to your hotel.<br>And they call it one of the most beautiful hotels in the Middle East. The people who’ve （ever） been there. But we don’t announce where and how. Because this is a decision we’ve been told to keep it.<br>The rooms are all ready.<br>你在说什么？<br>迪拜会议还是在迪拜举行。但是我们因为安全原因已经搬出了亚特兰蒂斯酒店。我们的会议搬到了另一个更安全的酒店，但是和亚特兰蒂斯一样漂亮。如果你来这里还是住亚特兰蒂斯酒店的话，参加会议是其中一个事情，我们将退款给你。<br>但是如果你要来参加会议，你还是可以呆在原来的地方…只是会议因为安全原因要到另一个地方参加。<br>所以会议如期进行，只是换了一个地方，因为我称之为“红圆圈”的组织正在进行他们最后的努力，也真的向我们展示了他们在幕后所做的安全工作。<br>你到达迪拜前三天我们已经搬走了。不过亚特兰蒂斯离新的地点并不远，只有4-5公里，我们将通知你新的地点。<br>如果你和很多人一起来，我们将安排巴士来接你们。<br>到过那里的人都称这个酒店是中东最美丽的酒店之一。但是我们并不宣布在哪里和怎么去。因为我们已经被告知需要这么做。<br>房间都已经安排好了。</p>
<p>03:25:00<br>Everything is done. And the only difference is that we protect our people the way we’ve done from the pedophiles.<br>The Conference is the same, we start on 08:00 o’clock on 21st of April. We go to 01:00/01:30 with the procedures from 02:00 til 05:00 or 06:00 o’clock the lunch and the presentation that you can show your systems and then we get start the second session, we’re choosing the members of the Universal Council on Friday the 22nd until 01:00-02:00 o’clock we finish.<br>And in the afternoon is again for lunch and understanding more for the position is with the Universal Council and the rest which we’ll meet with them and we structure the planning of the running of the Universal Council and the rest of us will be part of the being/bringing and sharing more knowledge.<br>Bring all the equipments, any system you built: Bring it with you.<br>Knowledge. Bring us the knowledge. We have given you a beautiful outside balcony where you can freely work and show.<br>所有一切都准备好了。唯一的区别就是我们保护我们的人远离恋童癖的方式。<br>会议时间没变，我们在4月21号早上8点开始。会议进程进行到下午1点或1点半，从2点到5点或6点，这段时间是午饭和你们展示你们系统的时间，然后我们开始第二阶段会议，我们在4月22号周五选举宇宙委员会的成员，直到中午1点到2点结束。<br>然后下午还是午饭和对于宇宙委员会所处位置的说明，剩下的时间是我们和宇宙委员会成员会面以及我们讨论宇宙委员会的工作计划，其他人将继续展示和分享更多的知识。<br>请带来所有的装置，任何你建造的系统：请你带来。<br>还有知识，请带给我们你的知识，我们已经提供了一个漂亮的户外展台，在那里你可以随意运行和展示。</p>
<p>And we have made sure it’s not a repetition. The 1st day lunch is in a gorgeous beautiful part of the restaurant. And the 2nd day we take you to a more beautiful part of the restaurant, it’s one of those hotels that it has a theme … what you call it … restaurants … ähm its about near the …. Dubai City , so you’ll enjoy it.<br>It’s a pleasure and hopefully for those who payed for the Gala Dinner, there is a Gala organized for you.<br>It is done in maculate??? (03:26:54) condition, but we had to bring this insanity …<br>我们已经确定这不是一个重复劳动。第一天的午饭在一个华丽的餐厅进行。而第二天我们带你们到一个更美丽的餐厅，那是其中一家酒店并拥有主题餐厅…它就在迪拜的…附近，所以你将会享受一番。<br>这对于那些已经为晚宴付费的人而言是很高兴和期待的，有一个庆典等着你。<br>这个是在有污点(03:26:54)的环境下进行？？？，但是我们还是要进行…</p>
<p>We are open they stay out they can use as weakness but in fact the number of the emails they got these Germans and the Belgium’s into the Middle Eastern police and everything to call us terrorists, they said “If it is how come”.<br>And then, when they start looking we are working with the government.<br>Now we got the addresses of all of you.<br>Now you actually gave us all your … Your mistakes are giving us a lot of information.<br>我们是开放的，他们就在外面，他们可以把这个看作弱点，但是实际上有很多邮件是这些德国和比利时人寄到中东警察和其他人那里宣称我们是恐怖分子？？？，他们说“这是怎么形成?”。<br>然后，他们开始看到我们和政府合作。<br>现在我们有你们所有人的地址。<br>现在你们实际上给我们所有你们的…你们的失误给我们很多信息。</p>
<p>Very soon there will be a knock on your door. You made a threat, you have to stand by it.<br>The one who pisses in the garden now has to say if he’s done the same thing with the other children.<br>His own daughters that’s the biggest question.<br>And what we are receiving from Utah, it seems to be the same.<br>Man you couldn’t keep your hands off your own daughters. How can/come the other children?<br>Go to Antwerp. Ask for your children.<br>Sorry to do that. We had a beautiful session today. We learned a lot …<br>不久之后就会有人敲你的门，你制造了威胁，你必须准备好???。<br>“在花园中小便的人”现在必须说明他是否对其他孩子也做了相同的事。<br>他自己的女儿，那是最大的问题。<br>我们在犹他州得到的信息，看上去是同样的。<br>如果你不能做到远离你自己的女儿，你怎么能远离其他孩子呢？<br>到安特卫普来，问问你的孩子们。<br>很抱歉做这个，我们今天有个很好的会议。我们学会了很多…</p>
<p>Rick: Mr. Keshe, like to be one thing that it relates to children but it’s good news. It’S from Carolina , it says: Someone has sent a message to her that says:“Carolina, I have good news. My daughter called me just now she is 6 years old and tells me Papa, Papa I can see a new world now. I said to her ok, tell me.<br>And she says: I can now say ‘Keshefoundation’!（ All are laughing from their heart ）<br>So that’S a nice write I think.<br>瑞克：凯史先生，可能有件事是涉及到孩子的，但是是个好消息。来自于Carolina的消息，有人已经给她发了消息：Carolina，我有好消息。我的女儿刚刚给我打电话了，她才6岁，她叫我爸爸了，我现在看到了一个新世界。我对她说很好，喊我吧。<br>她说：我现在能说“凯史基金会”！（所有人都发自内心的笑了）<br>所以那是我认为很不错的消息。</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:<br>This is phantastic. We are here to protect the children of man. Not to allow men to abuse our children.<br>But the beauty is: Now at least we are becoming man of the space. And hopefully in the space we see them because of who they are through their emotion.<br>What we learned today is the beginning of an evolution where we have control and at the same time til that evolution comes, we’ve shown our governments how much is the peace the true peace … with the new technology. It’s huge.<br>The Keshefoundation is not me anymore.<br>The Keshefoundation is You!<br>Let us see what we change<br>Thank you very much for today and we’ll see you next Tuesday afternoon and as I said:<br>Make sure that you protect your cameras and your children.<br>We are very innocent compared to these charlatan’s.<br>Thank you very much indeed.<br>Rick:<br>Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Keshe.<br>That’s the end of the 104th Knowledge Seekers Workshop of the Keshefoundation Spaceship Institute and once again as in the last 103 Workshops:<br>Thank you everybody for attending!<br>凯史先生：这太好了。我们来到这里保护人们的孩子，不要让人们虐待我们的孩子。<br>但是好的是：现在至少我们要成为太空人了。希望在太空中因为他们的情感能找到他们。<br>今天我们所知道是我们能够控制进化的开始并且直到进化出现，我们已经向政府展示新技术对于真正的和平的影响是多么重要，这是非常巨大的。<br>凯史基金会不再是我一个人。<br>凯史基金会是你们所有人！<br>让我们期待我们的改变吧。<br>今天非常感谢你，我们期待下周二下午的见面，且正如我所说：<br>保护你的相机和孩子。<br>我们和这些吹牛者比起来是很天真的。<br>真的很感谢你们<br>瑞克：感谢你，感谢你，凯史先生。现在104次知识寻求者教学结束了。感谢所有参与者！</p>
