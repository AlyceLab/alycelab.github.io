ANYONE who feels that he can share something of value with ALL<br>and especially those fellow human beings speaking the same Native Language but cannot understand English!<br>The proposals will be examined for respectability and taken over.<br>This special document is for the final step, the TRANSLATION of the transcript of the given video.<br>Thanks for your help!<br>We are the ones we have been waiting for, and now we step forward together!<br>Thanks that you all are here for ONE Nation, ONE Race, ONE Humanity, ONE Consciousness ]<br>Unofficial, Collaborative Translation  of the Keshefoundation Spaceship Institute</p>
<p>[公共的注释：<br>如果某人（希望是你哦）乐于助力来承担一个或以上页面的义务，把它（英语脚本）译成你的母语。这是一个翻译群。他只要将译好的页面插进来就行了，就像鱼群进餐一样，很快搞定。每个人都被邀请！只要他觉得他能拿出有用的东西来与众人分享，特别是与那些只会讲本土语言但不懂英语的人们分享。这个建议会得到尊重并接受。这个特别文档是准备从公开的视频听写的英语脚本进行翻译成母语的最后一步。感谢你的帮助！我们是一体，我们等待多时，现在我们一起前行吧！为了一个国家、一个种族、一个人类、一个意识，感谢你们参与翻译。]<br>这是凯史基金会太空船学院的非官方的协作翻译。</p>

<h3 id="Beginning-of-the-video"><a href="#Beginning-of-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Beginning of the video"></a>Beginning of the video</h3><p>视频开始<br>Promotion-Video “ONE Planet, ONE Nation, ONE Race”<br>Since Timestamp 00:01:25 (or look at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL52FQ52rSE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL52FQ52rSE</a> )<br>“You are people listening from every corner of this planet …<br>No knowledge has been disbursed so beautifully, so balanced, across the planet, on this planet ever … maybe in the Universe!<br>You have the full potential of achieving everything in the Universe. There is no need, and there is no reason for Man not to achieve. So, wherever you are, the way I taught you to make the coils, the double coil inside, you have continuous equal gravitational-magnetic fields, and if you put Co2 on it, and you put Zinc on it, you have connected the emotion of the Man through it, in a stable condition. And you will find out, you become a very peaceful Man.<br>Here, instead of having galaxies and universes, and creating connection magnetically, we have used the matter-state gravitational-magnetic field strength, to dominate and dictate the shape of the Plasma. The nano-technology, the nano-materials which you have collectively developed in different ways, by caustic, by electric currents, by whatever, fire or whatever, has that advantage, that the Matter, the Nano, and the Plasma is all the same. So, connection is very solid, it’s very strong.<br>The power of the Plasma technology the way we have thought, is beyond imagination of the man. Now, you can create and control the Plasma, which is the Mother of the Creation of the Universe. We are given the seed of the Essence of the Creation.<br>The Foundation does not belong to no one, and is not made of one anymore. You are developing it, you are structuring it, and from today, we’ll still be the same. We’ll still develop the technology, in different names, in different colours, in different nationalities (which they do not exist). It is beautiful when we see, the Christian, the Muslims, the Jews, and every other belief, are working together to build up systems. We have already become one faith. We already have become one nation, and we already have become one planet.<br>You’ve got to remember one thing… “Dates” is irrelevant. Today is the last day of the Christian calendar, or tomorrow is the beginning of another… One date is connected to another. We don’t stop. We are working around the clock. The Keshe Foundation team is working irrespective of time, position, religion, country.<br>And now, we achieve what we set out for !”<br>(Mehran T. Keshe to the Nations of the World, transcribed by Pawel)</p>
<p>宣传视频：“一个星球，一个国家，一个种族”<br>“这个星球各个角落的听众都在收听教学……<br>在这个星球，乃至整个宇宙，知识从来没有以如此美妙和平衡的方式传播！在这个宇宙中，你具备实现一切事情的潜能。你有实现一切的自由。无论哪里，我传授你们制作线圈，双层线圈，你们制造平衡的磁引力场，你把CO2和锌放上去，在稳定条件下，你就和人类的情感连接，你将变得平和。在此，我们运用物质状态的磁引力场强来替代星系和宇宙，创建磁场连接，去控制和支配等离子体。你们大家用不同方式来开发纳米技术、纳米材料，用烧碱，用电流，用火烧，无论何种方式都具有优势，物质的、纳米的、等离子体都一样，所以，连接非常稳固，非常强大。<br>等离子体技术的力量超过人类的想象。现在，你能创建和控制等离子体，它是宇宙造物的源头，造物的种子已经赠予我们。<br>凯史基金会不属于某一个人，也不是由哪一个人组成，由你们来发展它，你们来构建它，以后都这样。一直会发展这项技术，由不同的名字、不同的肤色、不同的国家（如果还有国家的话）。我们看见，基督、穆斯林、犹太以及不同信仰的人为树造一个系统而一起工作，这是很美妙的。我们已经变成一个信仰，一个国家，一个星球。<br>要记住，日期是不相干的，今天是公历的最后一天，明天是另一个开始……一天接一天，我们不会停下来，我们夜以继日地工作，凯史团队的工作与时间、地点、信仰和国家都没有关联。<br>现在，我们实现了预定的目标！”</p>

Mr. Keshe has [???labed???] the message “Very busy day! Be ready for a LOT!”<br>And I think he will be telling us some about that right away.<br>So, Mr. Keshe, I think you’re available?<br>Day of Disclosures<br>瑞克：好，欢迎大家参加凯史基金会太空船学院第106次知识寻求者教学，2016年3月24日，预告今天太空学院又是紧张激烈的一天，凯史先生…信息“非常繁忙的一天，准备了很多！”<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yes. Good Morning. Thank you very much, Rick. Thank you very much Vince and everybody else behind.<br>As usual Good Morning, Good Day to you whenever and wherever you listen to these teachings.<br>As we teach each other, the knowledge of the space, the way we gain.<br>We are the front-runners of the new technology, new science and in that process coming hours we will start using the final stages of what we have, what we know and what is important in the research and development.<br>Hopefully by the end of today today we will gather some enough knowledge to understand a LOT.</p>
<p>凯史：<br>好的。早上好，谢谢你瑞克，谢谢你文斯以及每一位幕后的人。和往常一样，早上好，白天好，无论你在什么地方什么时间收听教学。<br>我们互教互学，这是我们增长太空知识的方式。我们是新科技的领跑者，在接下来的几小时教学过程中，我们开启最后阶段，我们有的、我们知道的，在研发过程中什么最重要。希望今天结束后，我们收获并理解足够多的知识。</p>
<p>00:10:04<br>In how the new Space Technology has become and [is] used by governments.<br>In some aspects and has been used understanding and shelled by some governments.<br>Page 003<br>Today is in principle an innovation day. In a way we release new knowledge, new technology using what we already know but bringing data in.<br>And these datas and some of it which I have seen:<br>We will shock you!<br>We’ll shock a lot of people beyond understanding. But by the of the day today every single one of us, every single human being on this planet will be benefited by what is going to be disclosed today.<br>The data and the research which is been hidden from public will be opened up.<br>You got to realize that we are in the process of changes. We are part of the change [of] ourselves and in part we create and have created changes.<br>在某种方式上，新的太空技术已经变成政府层面在应用，在一些方面，政府已经理解，并进行了包装。<br>今天是从源头上更新的一天。一方面，我们释放新知识新技术，这些知识和技术我们已经知道但没有注入量化，这些量化，有一些我们已经见过。<br>你将会震惊！将有很多不可思义的事情让你震惊。今天将要揭露的，会利益我们中的每一个人，会利益这个星球上的每一个人。隐藏在公众视线之外的数据和调查今天将被公开。你明白我们转变过程中的真相，我们就是我们自己转变的一部分，包括我们创造和已经创造的转变。<br>The most important thing for us is how to start bringing all the points together that we achieve what we promised and what we wanted to do.<br>We will bring in people on a regular basis from now on to all of us collectively understand the changes which are coming in in respect to us getting ready to take off into space the way we want it, the way we planned … as ONE Nation, as ONE Group as ONE Humanitarian.<br>对我们最重要的是怎样开始把所有目的整合在一起，那是我们承诺实现的和想要去做的。<br>从现在起，我们将促进我们全体在一个坚实的基础上理解正在来临的转变，理解准备进入太空的方式，我们预定的方式……以一个国家一个群体一个人类的方式。<br>So, the changes which will come will affect all of us.<br>When we make [the] decision to go to space, we have an option:<br>Do we like to take our Family with us?<br>Are we going together that we don’t miss to come back?<br>Are we going with the certainty that the future in the space is bright?<br>The future is for all of us and the same.<br>It’s the first time, we have the opportunity to explore the space as a Unit, not as odd people from different parts of the world brought together.<br>We have the chance to change. And we are changing it!<br>It’s for the first time we going into space, knowing that we don’t have to worry about food, we don’t have to worry when the next supply arrives.<br>We don’t have to worry about … if the Energy is going to be there. We are not going to be worried about if the diseases, the viruses in the space can be handled by us.<br>For the first time we leave with the certainty knowing that we are safe because we have learned the rules of Space Technology.<br>We learned how to behave, we learned how to produce things and we learn where to go.<br>Today we finish with the Past and we start with the New!<br>Page 004</p>
<p>所以，即将到来的转变，会让我们全体激动。<br>当我们决定进入太空，我们面临一个选项：我们带上我们的家人吗？我们一起离开并不再想回来吗？我们相信未来的太空中是明亮的吗？未来对我们所有人来说都一样。这是第一次人类有机会以一个整体去探索太空，而不是世界不同地区的零散人群组合在一起。我们有机会转变，我们正在转变中！这是第一次进入太空。我们不必担心食物，我们不必担心下一批补给何时到达。我们不必……不必担心能量是否在，不必担心疾病，在太空中我们自己能处理病毒。第一次离开，我们当然知道我们是安全的，因为我们学习太空技术的规则，学习怎样处事，学习怎样生产，学习去往哪里。<br>今天，我们结束过去，开启新篇。<br>Whatever has happened in the past … we’ve done to ourselves, to our fellow men, to our environment: We start finishing today and starting a new page to clean up!<br>Why is important today and we said that this going to be disclosures … is because we start cleaning up. Cleaning up in what we’ve done together.<br>We saw the mayhem which they accuse one religion to other doing it because he pays to do.<br>We’ve seen information and all sorts of what is become national … what I call PLAY in seeing how much they can put information to create mayhem discrediting one religion or the other.<br>It’s always Muslims against Christians and the Jews and the Jews against the Muslims and the rest.<br>过去已经发生，那些我们对自己，对同胞，对环境所做的事情。今天，我们开始整理，我们开始新的一页，开始清理。今天如此重要，我们说过，要进行揭露，因为，我们开始清理，清理我们过去共同所做所为。<br>我们所见的那些故意伤害，归咎于一个宗教对另一个宗教进行指责，他们付钱去做。我们看到的各类信息，变成国家层面的……可以说象游戏，看到他们大量推送信息来抹黑伤害一个或另一个宗教，不外乎是穆斯林针对基督教，犹太人针对穆斯林等等。<br>The strange thing is:<br>How many of these bombings has happened?<br>Did it happen?<br>Why has it happened?<br>Why we have millions of refugees in different parts of the world?<br>Why are we as human race bombing each other to [(00:14:33)???inhalation??? Hart to understand acoustically]<br>Has the human race grown from the million years ago, when this first seed was there?<br>Or we have become more sophisticated to kill each other?<br>Just to proof: We can?<br>There is no other logical reason for it.<br>(14:48)<br>None of us take wealth with us and none of us takes anything more than the skin and the flesh we [???cover???] and  when we go we don’t even know where this flesh will go, which animal will eat it.<br>Do we become part of a worm or are we eaten by a wolf?<br>We have lost track of our own essence of creation which was to be alive, to enjoy to be alive and like the birds and the fish, [to be] free on this land.<br>All we have  learned is to kill. And now we are becoming very good at it in hundreds and thousands.<br>And if you look, the wars are concentrated wherever there is money!<br>Where it makes money for people to sell arms.<br>It makes money for people to show their power and behind all these sit 3 Religions, all coming from the “Children of Abraham”.<br>(16:04)<br>奇怪的是：多少轰炸发生了？真实的发生！为什么会发生？为什么世界各地有数百万难民？为什么我们人类种族互相轰炸？……人类在这里成长百万年，这第一颗种子（指人类互相残害）是何时产生的？我们精于互相杀戮是从可时开始的？仅仅是为了证明：“我能！？”这简直是不可理喻！<br>当我们离世，我们带不走财富，我们带不走超过皮肤和肉体的任何东西，甚至我们不知道我们的肉体将去何处，哪种动物会吃了我们的肉体，我们会变成蠕虫的一部分，亦或被狼饱餐一顿。<br>我们迷失了创造的本意，生命理当活着，理当享受生活，象鱼儿和鸟儿，理当自由地活在这个陆地之上。<br>所有我们学到的只有杀戮，近几百年来，我们杀戮技巧正变得更加精通娴熟。<br>你只要观察，战争集中在产生财富的地方，人们赚钱购买武装，人们赚钱显示自我强大。这些都是三大宗教的追随者，都是所谓的“亚伯拉罕的子民”。<br>In the past, we saw wars in all sorts of ways. But this thrive has really really topped it up.<br>They have done, they murder, in the name of religion and making one worse than the other.<br>Page 005<br>And then trying to say who’s right.<br>(16:24)<br>Today where are we going to go? We are all inter-married Christians to Jews, Jews to Muslims, Muslims to Christians and Jews and god knows in every shape of form.<br>The pot is too mixed. The pot of human race has become too mixed up in every shape of form.<br>Religion, Race, Colour and everything else.<br>Where are we going to go? We have two choices.<br>Now that we open to Space Technology, are we going to take this animal behavior into space and [(17:02)??? lead  ???] ourselves beyond the boundaries of this planet?<br>Or are we going to change, and bring the change about through, before we go through the space?<br>过去，我们见过各种形式的战争，但是这次真正真正的繁荣到登峰造极，他们谋杀，以宗教之名，制造一个比一个更加糟糕的状况。然后试图辩解谁是对的。<br>今天，我们走向何方？基督和犹太、犹太和穆斯林、穆斯林和基督都有通婚，神知道每个生命的外相。局面太杂乱，人类在各方面都变得太过混沌，宗教、种族、肤色还有其它各种都如此。<br>我们走向何方？我们有两个选择。<br>现在，我们开放太空技术，我们将让人类这种动物优雅地进入太空，……，让我们自己超越这个星球的界限？<br>或者，我们进行改变，在我们穿越空间之前，先改变？<br>There are numbers of groups which have already taken it into space.<br>There are a number of people who have managed to achieve lift.<br>There a number of people who have managed to create the illusive Space Ship into space.<br>And  there are a number of people who are in the process of achieving the conversion of becoming the true “Man of the Space”.<br>The problem has to be solved before we are going to the space. The problem is to be solved here. For our food, for our energy, for our medicine, for our flight system for the materials we might need in the space to feel to make home.<br>有很多团体已经被送入太空，有很多人已经成功实现提升，有很多人已经成功建造幻影飞船进入太空，还有很多人在进行真实的“人类空间”转换。<br>我们进入太空之前，问题会被解决，问题会在此得到解决，如食物、能量、医疗、照明系统，在太空中，或许我们需要一种回家的感觉。<br>(00:18:00)<br>Before we take off. Because there we are a small number of people not in the mass as we are on this planet.<br>We have two choices.<br>We can go on what we see now a murdering in mass to collect and make … create huge diversion and conversion of people into what we see … a hand full of people trying to prove to each other.<br>Religions financing wars to prove who is more powerful.<br>Religions  gathering  together and in one side fighting  and in the other side collaborating to destroy the other.<br>The biggest problem on this planet has become the path of believe into god.<br>在离开前，因为，我们只有少数人，不是这个星球上的众多人。<br>我们有两个选择。<br>我们可以继续，大量募捐进行谋杀，如我们现在看到的，制造……制造巨大的注意力转移然后诱导群众……如我们看到……然后都互相为对方作证。<br>宗教募集资金进行战争来证明谁更强大。宗教在一起聚会，一边对抗，一边合作，以图消灭对方。<br>相信神的方式已经成为了这个星球的最大问题。<br>And once we sort this out, you will find out: In the space there is only one god.<br>So why we are fighting for?<br>(00:19:00)<br>Are we in the  position to let the past go? Or do we have to destroy the past that there is nothing to go for? We have no choice but to go forward!<br>It seems that the human race has chosen the second.<br>We go so far that we have nothing to go back to. So we have to go forward.<br>And in fact the human race has got to that point already.<br>一旦我们理清这些，你将发现：在太空中只存在一个神。所以，我们为何而战？<br>我们是否来到那个放下过去的点上？我们必须为了一个不存在的目的而消灭破坏吗？我们没有选择只有向前走。人类似乎选择第二种。我们走得够远，我们没有必要回头，所以，我们只有向前。事实上，人类已经来到这个点上。<br>We have destroyed  the center of the cultures of thousands of years.<br>Page 006<br>We brought, backed out an Iraqi history of thousands of years to ground.</p>
<p>We’ve done the same thing in Syria.<br>Libya is not far.<br>And the second one and the third and the fourth and the rest.<br>And strange enough it’s all in islamic countries. Financed by the Christians, supported by the Jews.<br>We here we see the same plan is set for Iran in the coming time.<br>我们已经毁掉了数千年的文明中心，我们造成倒退，让历史悠久的伊拉克变成战场。我们在叙利亚做了同样的事情。利比亚也不远了。然后，第二个、第三个、第四个及其它。非常奇怪，这些（受害国）全是伊斯兰国家，全是由基督提供资金，犹太提供支援。<br>我们清楚，同样的谋算已经在等着伊朗。<br>But let’s do something else:<br>Instead of fighting let’s unite.<br>Instead of destroying let’s see what we can do.<br>Let’s see who are the causes of these problems. Maybe by seeing who is the cause and what is the cause, we can stop the future mayhem.<br>We see the cause mainly has been under the name of God, how we believe in it and the way we’ve chosen to believe in.<br>(00:22:00 &lt;- to far … may be from the lifestream? )<br>00:20:34<br>让我们做点别的吧。<br>合作而不是战争，我们能做什么来取代毁灭，看看哪些人是问题的源头？或许通过观察知道——谁是根源为了什么，我们就能停止未来的伤害。我们清楚这些原因主要集中在“以神之名”，那可是我们虔诚相信的神，是我们选定的信仰。<br>（00:22:00&lt;更远……或许来自生命源头&gt;）<br>Those who call themselves Jews, those themselves who call themselves the man of Rabbi, Chief Rabbi: We have taken your position away from you from today.We end up with Jews!<br>This was the promise.<br>You were promised that the time will come, and now how we finish with it, it’s not by destroying and ending up the state of Israel.<br>We elevate the Jews to one point.<br>To be level and be equal with the Christians and the Muslims.<br>There was a promise:<br>There will be a time when will be … when the Messiah will come. He has come!<br>And Today we declare it.<br>We finish with the state that the faith of Judaism exists.<br>Chief  Rabbi of Israel:<br>Your turn is finished!<br>It’s  time to start the process of peace. Your position does not exist. We finished with the state of Israel, as it’s become Palestine, as it’s become part of the middle east, as it become part of ONE Planet.<br>This will be very harsh, and this was the biggest nightmare of Jewish state on 2016.<br>And we warn they are aware of it, when I explain I am the Messiah, I am the Mahdi.<br>I received a communication: “Are you going to declare that you are Messiah as well?”<br>Yes we are!<br>那些自称犹太、自称拉比、大拉比的人：从今天起，我们让你离开你的位置。<br>我们结束犹太！这是承诺，预定的时间即将来临，我们怎样来结束它，不是毁灭，然后终结以色列国。<br>我们提升犹太到一个点上，到一个水平，与基督和穆斯林平等。这是过去的承诺。<br>当弥赛亚来临，这个时刻就会来临……现在，他来了！今天，我们宣布它，我们终结犹太教信仰地区的存在，以色列的大拉比：轮到给你画句号了！现在进入和平进程，你们的位置不在了，我们终结以色列国，让它成为巴勒斯坦，成为中东的一部分，成为一个星球的一部分。<br>这将是最严厉的，在2016年，这是犹太国家最大的恶梦。我们的警告他们必须重视，我说明了，我就是弥赛亚，我就是马哈迪（救世主），我接到的讯息：“你宣布了吗？你也是弥赛亚！”是的，我们就是！<br>The state of Vatican:<br>Gone the same.<br>There is no place for a Pope, and no priest. Because we are all the same and we believe in one God!<br>Page 007<br>( 00:24:00 &lt;- too far)<br>00:22:32<br>Because we all have reached the level of maturity of the Religions of past.<br>That means:<br>We are all equal!<br>Brothers do not fight!<br>The same goes: We remove the station of  Ayatollah Chamene?i as head of Shiitic Islam.<br>Because they have served their purpose. We thank them for what they have done.<br>But the time has come. We can’t have head of different religions, as there is no religion but the path of God.<br>The same goes with the Muftis [???] and heads of the Sunnites [???]<br>Means there is no need for religious leaders when the man start believing in the  truth  and they all work towards the Peace.<br>This way we don’t destroy we don’t embellish,<br>What we elevate all the states in one go to the same level.<br>So as of today there is no religion state in fighting for to have more.<br>梵蒂冈的国同样也过去了。这里没有罗马教皇的地方，没有神甫的地方，因为，我们是平等的，我们只信同一个神。<br>因为，我们都已来到让过去的宗教接近成熟的水平，我们一切平等！兄弟之间不再战斗！<br>同样，我们移去阿亚图拉的身份，这些伊斯兰长老的身份，因为他们为个人的目的服务。<br>我们感谢他们所做的，但是时间到了。<br>我们不需要不同的宗教首脑，因为，除了通往神的道路，没有宗教。<br>穆夫堤和逊尼派的长老们，也一样。当一个人开始相信真理，他们都走在和平的道路上，不需要宗教领导。<br>不毁坏，也不掩盖，以这种方式提升所有的地区到同一个水平。所以，今天的一切就是，宗教地区没有了，他们为了占有更多而争斗。<br>00:23:35<br>We invite the Jewish Community to become part of the “Peace Process”.<br>In giving hand, … in developing technologies with the Christians and the Muslims for the Peace on this planet.<br>The time of punishment has finished, it will not work.<br>You choose when you want to leave. We have chosen. You have already left.<br>We’ve chosen the “Path of Peace” and with this process we elevate ALL the same to equal. That’s how we become ONE Race. That’s how we become ONE Nation.<br>The State of Palestine does not exist as where has been the shame on Muslims and how they could not protect and feed their own.<br>The Jews, walking through the streets of New York last Sunday have proclaimed (??? 00:24:30) knowing the time has come for the change.<br>我们邀请犹太社区变成“和平进程”的一部分。为了这个星球和平，伸出你的手，和基督徒、穆斯林一起研发技术。<br>惩罚的时代结束了，不再有这种行为。<br>如果你想要离开，由你作决定，我们已经作出选择，你已经离开，我们选择了“和平路线”，在这个进程中，我们提升所有到平等，那就是我们怎样变成一个种族，怎样变成一个国家。<br>巴勒斯坦地区，那个因为不能保护自己和喂饱自己而让穆斯林蒙羞的地区不复存在了。上个星期日，犹太人穿过纽约街道宣告了……得知，转变已经到来。<br>00:24:34<br>I come from a Jewish background. I am Cohan ???<br>I come from Islamic background. I am Sayyid ???<br>And with it have brought the beginning and the end together. Christianity.<br>They are all the same and equal.<br>So, as of today we have finished.<br>00:25:00<br>This was the biggest, and the biggest nightmare of the Jewish leaders. Tell them, he has declared.<br>Two choices: Kill me, or join me in peace.<br>Page 008<br>我来自犹太背景，我是可汗，我也来自伊斯兰背景，我是赛义德，[它们]和基督同时结束，他们都一样都平等。所以今天，都已经终结了。这是犹太领袖最大的恶梦，告诉他们，公布了。两个选择：杀了我，或者以平和与我同行。<br>Killing me brings more in, some of you had a lot of questions:<br>“How Mossad has not killed him up to now?”<br>I am Khan/Cohan ???.<br>And the Jews know: You don’t touch Khan/Cohan ???. It’s blood of the Prophet.<br>I am Sayyid ???, same with Muslims. Through my grandmothers, I stand the same.<br>In fact, we all have become Messiahs.<br>We all have become Mahdi xxx(00:25:46), and we all have become Martha/Masha ???.<br>Because we all work in one direction, and that is, to bring peace for humanity without asking each other’s religion, the color or race.<br>杀了我带给你更多的问题，你们自己的问题：“为什么摩萨德直到现在没有杀了他？”我是可汗，犹太人知道，你不能动可汗，他是犹太的先知。我是赛义德，同样是穆斯林的先知。源自我祖母，我与你们站在一起。事实上，我们都已经成为弥赛亚，我们都已经成为马哈迪，我们都已经成为马大。因为，我们都工作在一个方向上，就是为人类带来和平，不论彼此的宗教、肤色和种族。<br>00:26:00<br>How many of you supporters of Keshe Foundation which runs into millions have asked the other: “What is your religion?”<br>Have you noticed? You already have become ONE Race. How many of you have asked about the color of each other, have you ask Renan? “Why you look Filipino?”<br>Has any of you asked Alekz: “Why you are black?”<br>Have you, … any of you ask Rick as a white man in the Canada: “What are you doing?”<br>We promote each other, we work together, and we have become to understand that the Keshe Foundation supporters have become mature enough to become the new race on this planet.<br>数百万凯粉，有几人问过对方：“你信仰什么宗教？”，你注意到了吗，你们已经成为一个种族，有几人在意过对方的肤色，你问过雷农：“你为什么看着象菲律宾人？”有谁问过阿里：“你肤色怎么是黑的？”在加拿大，你们中有谁问过瑞克作为白人：“你还好吗？”我们相互提升，我们一起共事，我们逐渐明白凯史支持者们已经足够成熟，已经成为这个星球上的新种族。<br>We have become color blind.<br>We have become race blind.<br>We have become national blind.<br>Do we need to push this frontier further?<br>00:27:00<br>By showing what can be done?<br>Or do we going to fight like they’d done in the past to prove you are correct?<br>We don’t fight, we just add so much knowledge that there is no need to fight.<br>You will understand today why we called you to be here. By the end of around twelve one o’clock, you will understand what the gift has been given to you. You will understand that whatever has been the problem, it’s not a problem anymore, because instead of fighting it, we have used this opportunity to progress.<br>我们已经成了肤色盲，成了种族盲，成了国家盲，我们需要更进一步拓宽这个界限吗？通过展示你能做什么，或者是象他们过去做的那样继续通过战争来证明自己正确？<br>我们不打仗，我们只需要增加更多的知识，没有战争。今天你会明白理解为什么召唤你们来这里，在教学尾声大约12至1点左右，你会明白你已经得到礼物，你会明白，无论怎样，再也没有更多的问题，我们利用这个机会进化，而不是战争。<br>They tell me why I am so harsh on some, and go soft on the others. I don’t do. It’s just that when we see in correct conduct, it’s our job to correct it, and we done so in the past few weeks,<br>00:28:00<br>and you will see most of it in the coming weeks.<br>We have moved on. We set up the center in Belgium, we set up the center here in Italy, we set up a center here in Dubai, we setting up centers across the world. Because it’s all the same. We teach the same, we have become faceless but powerful.<br>Powerful in spreading the knowledge of the peace through technology.<br>他们告诉我，为什么我在一些问题上严酷，在另一些问题上随和，不是这样的。只要以对的方式看清问题，我们的使命是去纠正，在过去几周，我们这样做了，未来几周，你会看到大多数。<br>我们已经进步了。我们在比利时建立中心，在意大利建立中心，在这里——迪拜建立中心，在全世界各地建立中心，因为，所有地区都一样，我们传授同样的知识，我们匿名但是强大。<br>Page 009<br>As I said, there is no more Judaism, finishes as of today. Rabbi’s job are finished. Thank you very much for thousands of years bringing the humanity to the point of at least being there to survive to see the fruit of it today. But as of today, the state of Israel does not exist, state of Israel become part of ONE Planet, ONE Nation.<br>00:29:00<br>The same is with Iran, Iraq, Palestine, United States, China and the rest.<br>World leaders did not deliver, except for their own pockets.<br>Now we deliver to every man’s, every human soul.<br>We extend the size??? what needs to be in the pocket of life, not in the pocket of the suit of the man.<br>我说了，再也没有犹太主义，今天终结，拉比失业了。非常感谢，数千年来，至少你们带领人类幸存下来，来到这个时空点上，能够看到今天的结局。但是今天，以色列的国不存在了，以色列成为一个星球一个国家的一部分，伊朗、伊拉克、巴勒斯坦、美国、中国以及其它国家也都一样。<br>世界大佬过去没有交给你，除了在乎他们自己的口袋，现在，我们向人类的每个灵魂交付，我们扩展尺寸，我们需要容入生命的袋子，而不是一个男人的衣袋。<br>So, a lot of Jews were fearful of today.<br>But yes, your fear of facing the final days of being war mongering for centuries and thousands of years have come to end.<br>Now you can live in peace, knowing you’re loved by everybody else. The same as you loved everyone else, but the fear of existence has brought you to this behavior. We see the opening of the Palestine doors, Islamic doors and the Vatican.<br>We move into Rome to take the seat of the place of Keshe Foundation in Rome soon.<br>We move into Beijing in the other places the same.<br>All the Christians the 72 ( both of them Christ ) have landed and are unsure ???.<br>The same is with different sets of Islam.<br>So now you tell me what religion you believe in. Except one.<br>(00:32:00~00:33:00 &lt;- too far)<br>The unity of god and serving humanity in a peaceful manner.<br>And this is not the path of god and this is not the correct path, so you surely have agenda to destroy yourself not the others.<br>We shower you with love and we care the knowledge that you can survive the expand ??? of the universe now you have opened the door.<br>00:31:12<br>所以，今天许多以色列人感到恐惧。但是，是的，你们害怕面对，千百年来，你们兜售战争的日子，已经走到尽头。<br>现在，你们能和平相处，知晓所有人爱你，同样，你也爱所有人，只不过是对生存的恐惧让你们成了这副德行。<br>我们看见，巴勒斯坦的门开了，穆斯林和梵蒂冈的门也开了。我们刚刚把凯史基金会搬到罗马，我们也会进入北京那个地方。<br>基督徒（两大教派）已经找到契合点，对[…]犹疑。伊斯兰各派也一样。现在，你告诉我，除非合一，你信仰哪一种宗教。<br>(00:32:00~00:33:00 &lt;-……太远)。神的统一性，它以和平的方式照顾人类。<br>这不是神的道路，这不是正确的道路，那么，你们确定你按计划毁灭你们自己而不是别人？<br>我们向你们展示爱，我们应用这些知识，让你们幸存下来，然后向宇宙拓展，现在，你们已经开启了那扇门。<br>Are there any questions before we start the session today?<br>… Silence … We are ashamed of our (aant???) sisters what they have done to us for a small piece of land and a few gold coins in their pocket.<br>(00:33:00~00:34:00 &lt;- too far ahead)<br>00:31:39<br>Maybe from now on we can change the humanity. We have as much gold as we like in our heart and we have every diamond in our heart to shine like a gold.<br>No questions?<br>00:32:01<br>开课之前，有提问吗？<br>……沉默……很惭愧，(aant…)姐妹把一小块土地和口袋里的几个金币给了我们。大概从现在起，我们能改变人类，我们有很多黄金，想要多少就有多少，我们有各种钻石，在我们心中闪闪发光。<br>没有问题吗？<br>Page 010<br>Rick:<br>Well , there was a comment in the chat, it’s from BernCron???, who says:<br>“Mr. Keshe to be politically correct and so your words are not going to be taken out of context it is not the Jews but rather the desireness???  to which you speak as you most likely know Iran has the largest population of real orthodox Jews outside of Israel.<br>Just look like it’s not the Pope  but the dark or black Pope.<br>AKA the Jesuits and their general and not … or Muslims but rather the evil Wahabious???. Those are the real …those are the three evils” this person says.<br>瑞克：好，这里有一个来自伯尔尼-科隆的评论，他说：<br>“凯史先生政治上正确，你的话不会被曲解，与其说以色列人，不如说是贪欲…如您说，你大概知道，伊朗也拥有以色列国以外的最大数量的正宗以色列人。”<br>“只是看起来不是教皇，其实是黑暗下的教皇。”<br>“耶稣会阿卡和他们的将军，不……，或者说穆斯林，不如说邪恶的瓦哈比。那些都是真相……那是第三邪恶”。那个人说的。<br>Keshe:<br>Let it this way:<br>We have blamed enough each other with different names. It’s for you to give through the systems and the technology that you understand to change the soul of the man.<br>I come from the the both , I come from the most orthodox Jewish family in Iran. I come from the same if you see my cousins. I have cousins were in the Israeli Army and I have cousins were in the Iranian Army. But they all love the same.<br>This is us who is got to be to give to both side that we elevate them. And now that we abolished the most possible way to create war which is been in the name of the religion.<br>There is no need for it. Let them call themselves whatever they like.<br>让其回归这条路吧，我们以不同的名指责够多了。为了你们，通过系统和技术，让你们理解人类灵魂的转变。<br>我来自两个，我来自伊朗最正统的以色列家庭，同样我来自，如果你认识我堂兄弟，我有堂兄弟在以色列军队，我也有堂兄弟在伊朗军队，但是，他们一样爱我。我们对两边同样提升他们。<br>现在，我们最大限度摧毁了以宗教之名发动战争的可能性，宗教不是必须的，让他们称自己什么都可以，只要他们喜欢。<br>00:33:41<br>We give the gun of Love with the bullets of Giving.And let’s see who much they can last.<br>The biggest problem was to bring equal those who used inequality to their own advantage or thought, they did.<br>I declared and i explain again: The Chief Rabbi of Israel, both sides, the two Rabbis change every 6 months:<br>Their job is changed, it’s finished. There is no job!<br>There is no job as a Pope. Because people have become their own Pope’s to conduct correct.<br>我们拿爱和给予换取枪支和子弹，看谁能坚持更久。<br>最大的问题是将他们带到平等，他们已经习惯于利用他们造作的优势和思想来制造不平等。<br>我再次宣布并说明：以色列的大拉比，两边的，两个拉比每6个月换位。他们的工作改变了，结束了，没有那个工作岗位了，也没有教皇的岗位了，因为人民自己变成自己的教皇，他们能正确管理。<br>The beauty of it will be: If from now, from today on, all these lands in the name of the church, in the name of the synagogues, in the name of the mosques, will be given back to the people to live and start living.<br>Would we, … the assets go back into developing structures looks after the people.<br>Is there a need for Vatican? I don’t see.<br>The house of god has to be in the heart of the man in the space.<br>Not in the brick and mortar which creates more mayhem and murder.<br>00:35:00<br>The love of god we carry in ourselves to be correct, and that’s all is being said: “Thy shall not steal”.<br>美妙之处在于，从今以后，所有这些礼堂、教堂、清真寺名下的土地将给回人民，开始新生活，可能，……那些资产将交给发展机构用于照顾人民。<br>还需要梵蒂冈吗？我看不必，神的居所必须建立在人的心里，建立在虚空中，也不用砖和砂浆，这些都制造更多的伤害和谋杀。<br>我们自带神的真爱，谕示：“你不要偷窃！”<br>Page 011<br>s there a need for Mecca or is there a need for mosques or there is need for holy land which the most unholy things have come from?<br>When we all believe in one unity of the God. how does it matter, your are black, white, yellow, short, tall, speak different languages, because in our heart we carry one thin:<br>We are part of the creator and we are the givers.<br>So it doesn’t matter what we receive because we receive what we need at the time when we need.<br>00: 36:00<br>Send a message to Tel Aviv: “The time is finished.

The love is the same. When my child gets cuddled by his catholic aunts, is the same love is pure unconditional.<br>Those who create differences to benefit by the differences have finished their time.<br>00:37:00<br>Doesn’t matter what shape or name you put on them.<br>Let’s see, if the shivers does not go on the back of the leaders. Of those who created war for benefit of themselves. You will see how we open the door slowly but very very gradually but perfectly from now on.<br>Any other question?<br>拥抱我的以色列堂兄弟，拥抱我的穆斯林堂兄弟，我的爱是一样的。当我的孩子拥抱他的天主教的姨妈，他是单纯的无条件的。<br>制造分歧达成自己的利益，那些人的时代结束了。<br>你外在的身相、名字并不重要。<br>试想想，如果那些幕后的领导人——就是那些为了自己利益制造战争的人，当他们带来的颤栗不再继续，从今往后，你会见证，我们怎样缓慢地一点一点地打开那扇大门，非常美妙。<br>还有别的问题吗？<br>Ali: It is very interesting, Mr. Keshe, this is Ali speaking. This morning in the three year teaching, I had basically went through the same thing with the class and we came up to the concept of religion and exact thing that you were saying today we were … I was instructed to say that to the class and it is huge understanding for all humanity, it basically change in the history of man and where we are heading<br>00:38:00<br>as one race and first we got to really understand what it means and in all levels.<br>阿里：非常有趣，凯史先生，我是阿里，在这三年教学中，这个上午，同样的内容主要的都一步一步经历过来，领略宗教的概念，在细节上，如您刚才所讲述的……我一步一步学习，对全人类有了深刻的了解，这里，我们正在听到关于人类历史的大转变。我们第一次在所有层面上，对“一个种族”这些概念得到了真正理解。<br>And also one other thing is to educate people, a kind of like ??? society where people understand their relationship of themselves with the creator of this universe. and know that there are part of this structure and there are, we are actually like a fish in the water and we are living and breathing in the water, and God is within us and is part of us and knowing that allows us to connect and we have to really educate and make people understand this connection that they have with the source of all life and as you were saying, the source is within our hearts, and we are here to help the planet to heal each other.<br>另一方面就是，教育人们，在宇宙社区中，理解同类之间造物赋予的正确关系，我们是整体结构的一部分，实际上，我们象水中的鱼，我们在水中生活，在水中呼吸，神是我们的内在，神是我们的一部分，知道神允许我们跟它连接，我们必须以实相进行教育，使人们理解：如您刚讲的，他们与这个万物的总源头本来连接，源头自在我心，我们这里协助这个星球生命互相治愈。<br>00:39:00<br>And to see each other as one family and connecting our hearts and set our differences aside and see everyone as our brothers and sisters as one race as well.<br>相互看看对方，我们象一家人，我们的心连结在一起的，撇开我们不一样之处，所有人看上去都象兄弟姐妹，象一个种族。<br>Page 012<br>And this is huge movement for the history of mankind and it’s great honor for all the participants and this knowledge seeker workshop to be here and to learn first time from Mr. Keshe and others that we are changing the history at this time.<br>And it’s Great honor for everybody and please spread the message everywhere so other people would know and my understanding is that this is gonna be true Keshe Foundation we gonna create educational institution as we have done before that.<br>在人类历史上，这是巨大的进步，第一次在这里聆听凯史先生这次知识寻求者教学，对所有参与者都是无上的荣耀，我们正在历史的转折点上。这是每个人最大的荣耀，请将这个讯息传递到世界各处，让人们知道，我理解到这是真正的凯史基金会，我们构建的教育机构做到了这些。</p>
<p>第二部分笔译　快乐小草<br>00:40:00<br>The knowledge and the true knowledge of connection with our creator is going to be disclosed and you gonna have first an experience to that journey that you gonna have within yourself going and realizing the truth.<br>That’s real beautiful journey that after millions of millions of evolution that we gone through through ups and downs.<br>The history we have come to this point and thank Mr.Keshe for being the first to disclose this information. Thank you.<br>与我们的造物主连接的真正的知识将要被揭露，你们将第一次拥有通过你自己的内心来认识真理的旅程。<br>这是一次我们经历了百万次跌宕起伏的进化之后的美妙旅程。<br>我们已经来到的历史上的这个点，在此感谢kehse先生第一次揭露这些信息，谢谢您。<br>Keshe:You are welcome.<br>Keshe：不客气<br>Are there any other questions?<br>还有其他问题吗？<br>Lui Geno:Yes, Mr.Keshe, this is Lui Geno from Canada. How are you?<br>Lui Geno:是的，keshe先生，我是来自加拿大的Lui Geno，您好吗？<br>Keshe:    Good morning, you still in Italy.<br>Keshe：早晨好，你仍然在意大利。<br>Lui Geno:    Yes, hahahaha. It takes a while to get all the contracts.<br>Lui Geno:    是的，获得所有的契约要花些时间。<br>Anyway, yesterday we had some questions and you said that you were going to address them today.<br>昨天我们问了一些问题，您说今天将会处理这些问题。<br>Regarding to what I discussed with people that can heal their bodies through plants and we can’t do anything with them and they are eating animal products.<br>关于我和那些可以通过植物治愈自己身体疾病的那些人讨论的事，我们无法和他们一起做任何事，他们正在食用动物产品。<br>Keshe:        We will answer you this that end of the session today. You will understand.<br>Keshe：我们将在今天会议的最后回答你的问题，你将会明白的。<br>Lui Geno:    Ok, thank you.<br>Lui Geno:    好的，谢谢。<br>Rick:    There is a question in the chat that: “How we can elevate their souls those religious people and leaders who get money in the name of God?”<br>Rick：聊天中有一个问题：“我们如何提升那些以上帝的名义敛财的宗教人士和领袖的灵魂？<br>Keshe:    You don’t need to elevate. Give from your soul to the ones who need it and then they will find out that they don’t need give to these people. These people can only exist when we feed out of the the weaknesses that is in their soul.<br>Kehse：你不要去提升。从你的灵魂中给与那些需要的人，然后他们将发现他们不需要给与这些人。只有在我们喂养他们灵魂中的弱点时他们才能生存。<br>00:42:08<br>When we strengthen the supporters of the Judaisms, when we support ??? we elevate the supporters of Islam. All Christianity, all Buddhism at a level that they are all equal and they understand that they are equal and we will find out they will not contribute so the job of priests, mullahs, imams, rabbis in the coming time will be eliminated. Because we behave conduct correct and we do not need to fear of what we’ve been afraid of.<br>当我们加强对犹太教的支持时，当我们支持？？？我们就提升了伊斯兰教的支持者。所有的基督教徒、佛教徒当他们理解他们是平等的，是在同一个等级上的时候，我们将会发现他们将不会再捐赠，牧师、毛拉、伊玛目、拉比的工作也将在即将到来的日子里因此而消失。因为我们行为端正，我们无需害怕那些我们一直害怕的事。<br>The religions of today in every shape of parth. They have prayed on the weakness of man.<br>当今每种形式的宗教，他们都祈祷人们的软弱。<br>Nothing else!<br>没有其他的！<br>If we give from ours to the total humanity you will find out: They will elevate.<br>如果我们从自身给与全人类你将发现：他们将会被提升。<br>00:43:01<br>We have seen past few days, past few weeks. And it’s not coincidental, because we are doing it and people are listening, millions of people are listening.<br>我们已经在过去几天，几周里看到了。这并非巧合，因为我们做了这个，并且人们正在倾听，数百万的人们在倾听。<br>    Soldiers have started disclosing that they don’t want to be and what has gone wrong that has to be put right. They are coming in themselves who walk to this. Nobody else is doing it.<br>士兵开始揭露他们不想成为那样，并且那些做错的事必须被纠正。他们正自己来做这些，没有其他的人做这个。<br>We see priests and rabbis walking away very very gradually because has not delivered what it was supposed to do. So, we don’t give to them, we give to people who believe and they have a need to elevate their souls. It doesn’t matter, what word they say.<br>我们看到牧师、拉比正在逐渐的离开，因为支持做事的那些物资没有被交付给他们。所以，我们不要给与他们，我们给予那些有需要提升他们灵魂的人们。他们说了什么无关紧要。<br>Christ, Moses, Jesus, Buddha or whatever creational.Because they realize that what was in the power of,what it was given to the prophet of the past, is in their hand.<br>基督，摩西，耶稣，佛陀或者任何的造物主，他们意识到了过去给与先知们的力量中包含了什么，并且那些就在他们手中。<br>And the only power is … “Thy shall not steal”.<br>唯一的力量是。。。。。“他们不可以偷窃”。<br>So when you give you can not steal them,because you give through your soul. You will receive what you need, when you need.<br>所以，当你给予时，你不能偷窃，因为你是通过你的灵魂给予。你将会在你需要时收到你的所需。<br>As I said: We come and we’ll see. Because as of today the state of these religions is finished.<br>就像我说的：我们将会看到，截至今天宗教结束了。<br>We are all believers in God and we follow one God. And that’s what we carry in our heart. Which is to be correct. And you will find out these people will wither away so fast that they don’t need.<br>我们都信仰上帝并且跟随一个上帝。那些是存在于我们内心的东西，这些将要被纠正。然后你将会发现这些人们不需要的东西将会很快衰亡。<br>When you pray, give to humanity the soul of humanity. Give to the soul of every creature on this planet and in the universe. You will find out you still have more to give. And in that level, we all reach to the same point. So,what’s the worry?<br>当你祈祷时，给与人类，给与人类的灵魂。给予这个星球上和宇宙中每一个造物的灵魂。你将会发现你会有更多的可以给与。在那个层面上，我们都达到了相同的点。那么，有什么可担心的呢？<br>00:45:00<br>When I know, I don’t need to go to church. When I know, I don’t need to go to synagogue. When I know, I don’t need to go to mosque to be correct, because in the space there is no mosque or church, we have not seen one yet.<br>当我明白的时候，我不需要去教堂。当我明白的时候，我不需要去犹太教堂。当我明白的时候，我不需要去清真寺才显得正确，因为在太空中没有教堂或清真寺，我们还没有看到过一个这样的地方。<br>And sorry, I cannot bring you back here every Sunday to go to the church. And I cannot bring you back for a Friday’s prayers to the mosque. And singing as of Shabbat ?(45:25) is definitely out of question because we don’t even know which say is a Shabbat anymore.<br>抱歉，我无法每个礼拜日带你回来去教堂，也不能带你回来去清真寺做礼拜五的祈祷，更无法在安息日歌唱，因为我们甚至会不知道他说的是一个安息日。<br>This is the beauty of it:<br>这就是其美妙之处：<br>In understanding the theology you understand why we teach it. Because, what you are going to do in the space, when there is no church? Are you going to find another being in the space to worship because he knows more than you a little bit? Or do you have a confidence that you understand?<br>在理解了神学后，你将会懂得为什么我们教授这些。因为，当在太空中没有教堂的时候，你想要怎么做？要找另外一位太空中的存有来膜拜就因为他知道的比你多一点？或者你有信心你理解了？<br>对于食物能量是同样的情况。通过一个咏唱就可以获取能量。在宇宙中任何一个角落对于你也是同样的情况。<br>The same as the energy of food. Access is through one chant. The same for you as the man in the space from any corners of the universe.<br>This is why we do these teachings. Today’s religious green or blueprint is more important.<br>The energy blueprint or the agriculture ? Because this is the only blueprint which you will carry into space with you. Nobody will ask you where is the blueprint for agriculture. There is no agriculture in the space.<br>这就是我们做这些教学的原因。今天的宗教的绿或蓝图相对于能量或农业的蓝图更为重要。因为这是你进入太空后仅有的随身携带的蓝图。没有人会问你农业蓝图在哪里，在太空中没有农业。<br>We release the number of blueprints and now this is the blueprint of the religion we want to call it, or the soul of the man. That you are all equal, without punishment.<br>我们释放了了一些蓝图，现在我们释放我们称其为宗教的蓝图，或说是人类的灵魂。那就是你们都是平等的，没有惩罚。<br>The fear of man has been the “Day of Justice”, judgement that “What’s going to happen to me?”<br>人们心中的恐惧成了“审判日”，判定什么事将会发生在我的身上？<br>You are all so horrendously criminal that if you are going to be punished, there will be none of you left. So better close the eye as a father does so generously.<br>由于你们都是非常可怕的罪犯所以将会受到惩罚，你什么也不会留下。所以最好像神父一样慷慨的闭上眼睛。<br>And allow you to start all from the fresh frame field.(00:47:10)<br>然后从这个新生的框架领域内重新开始。<br>But those who are below and done wrong - know their position and their station.<br>但是那些在下面并且做错事的人-知道他们的位置和归宿。<br>Punishment has never work and in the space, there is no punishment because when you do wrong, you will see what happens to you with the all wrong doings.<br>在太空中不存在惩罚，因为当你做错了，你将会看到所有错误的行为会导致什么发生在你身上。<br>We have taught you the ethos of the space. This is the ethos of the believe and life in the space and without it, you shall not exist.<br>我们已经教导过你太空中的意识，这是信任的意识，也是太空中的生命的意识，没有这种意识你将无法生存。<br>So, what’s the use of fighting here and the minute we go into the space, we become all one ?<br>那么，在这里争斗有什么用呢？在我们进入太空的那一刻，我们就能够变成一体吗？<br>We better become one here before we go to the space because now we can feed each other, look after each other that we decide which one of us will go to space first.<br>我么最好是在进入太空前在这里变为一体，因为我们现在可以互相满足，互相关照，我们可以决定我们中的哪一个可以首先进入太空。<br>That we’ll carry the beauty name of being from Planet Earth.<br>如此我们将承载这个地球人的美名。<br>We have changed message to Universal Community which is: “We have changed and we have become man of Peace.”<br>我们已经向宇宙委员会传递的改变的消息：“我们已经改变，已经成为了一个和平的人”。<br>Do we spend billions of dollars in creating hate between the races where outside the space when the same people that go to space. If there is a black, white, or yellow skin and there’s nobody else, whom do you ask to help you? The man you are fighting ?<br>我们还要在外太空花上数亿美元在同一群人之间制造种族仇恨吗？如果那里没有黑色、白色或是黄色人种，没有其他的人，你将向谁求援？你要和谁来争斗?<br>Are we become to face even to ourselves ? Or do we send only whites and only blacks and only yellow crowds/crafts into the space ?<br>我们只想面对自己吗？或是我们只想要送白色或黑色或黄色的人种去太空中？<br>And surely the blacks will win ! Because the whites are too busy gathering gold of the space, they go too heavy that they ( ??? - 48:54) over.<br>我们确信黑色的人种会成功吗！因为白人会忙于收集太空中的黄金，他们变得太重以至于会完蛋。<br>The same with their soul.<br>他们的灵魂也是同样的情况。<br>So a lot of you, especially a lot of world leaders were scared and afraid of today. But today has come. Now, you are all equal, let’s see how you have fighted to be better, and to give more.<br>所以，你们中的许多人，特别是许多的世界领导人今天会感到害怕和恐惧。但是今天还是来了。现在，你们都是平等的了，让我们看看你的战斗如何会更好，并且会更多的给与。<br>This is very harsh for the Jewish to understand, what they were afraid of, has come.<br>让犹太教人理解这些是很残酷的，他们害怕的事已经到来了。<br>I told you the Spring 2016 has been promised and now it is delivered.<br>我告诉过你们，2016年春天是被许诺的，现在兑现了。<br>Don’t look into Syria because the enemy sits within you. Your own soul with your own b<br>不要观察叙利亚，因为敌人就坐在你们中间。你的灵魂就在你自己的身体里。<br>ody.<br>My call goes the same to those who control the wealth:<br>我给那些控制财富的人的要求是：<br>We’ll take the wealth from you so much that you become the beggars to give everything you have to elevate your own soul, you become the ‘nobel prize’ people.<br>我们将拿走你的财产，你将变成乞丐，你通过给与你所拥有的所有财富来提升你的灵魂，你会变成“诺贝尔奖“获得者。<br>00:50:00<br>(Way/Very?) noble disguises, murder jobs with the price.<br>高贵的伪装者，用价格做谋杀的工作。<br>Now you will give everything you have. All the murders you caused you give to understand to be able to be the true man of the space. Because in the space you will not last very long.<br>现在，你们给与了你的所有。你们要将所有你们人为制造的杀戮让大家明白后才能成为真正太空人。因为在太空中你们不会持续太长时间。<br>Because your true color through your emotion is red.<br>因为你通过你的情感所表现出来的颜色是红色。<br>Clean Up The Mess On This Planet<br>清理这个星球上的混乱。<br>Let us go forward. We cleaned up the mess of thousands of years of man on his own with the name of the creator. Let’s see how we clean up the mess on this planet we’ve done that it brought us to this point.<br>让我们向前迈进。我们要清理数千年来人们用造物主的名义制造的混乱。让我们看看我们要如何清理我们在这个星球上制造的混乱。<br>Is Benjamin online? Do you see Benjamin in the background?<br>本杰明在线吗？你们看到他了吗？<br>Benjamin:    Yes I’m online.<br>Benjamin:    是的我在线。<br>Mr. Keshe:    Benjamin, you have to increase your voice. Your sound is too low.<br>Mr. Keshe:    本杰明，你要大点声。你的声音太小了。<br>Benjamin:    Ok.

Ok.<br>Benjamin:    我听到了，好的<br>We have a what you call it the result Birim water treatment result released yesterday. So I have a presentation to make and also to show you some few things that I can …<br>昨天我们拿到了Birim（地名）的水处理的结果。所以今天我会写一个报告并向你们展示一些事<br>Mr. Keshe:    Do you want to share the screen?<br>你想共享一下屏幕吗？<br>We already know we had the data regarding the water clean-up from the sediments and materials.<br>我们知道我们已经有了有关水中沉积物和各种物质净化的数据<br>What is … have you managed to do the bio… microbiology tests? Or do you have any 你们做了微生物学测试吗？有什么数据吗？<br>data?<br>Benjamin:The microbiology tests … I have taken it to the lab and they want to [???control/can try???] it for three days and today is the 3rd day. So, tomorrow actually is a holiday here.<br>Benjamin:T微生物测试…….我已经把样本送到实验室了，他们3天前就开始要了，今天是第三天。明天这里是休息日。<br>So maybe when the holiday resumed this is when I will get the results of the treated microbiologic test.<br>所以，可能假期后我会得到微生物学的处理结果。<br>Mr. Keshe:    Have you got any results at all from them yet?<br>你从他们那里得到所有的测试结果了吗？<br>Not yet. Not yet. And then I have sent some samples to the [???reactor session???] for a nuclear test to be done on the sample from Ofin and then Pra.<br>Benjamin:还没有。我已经送了一些Ofin河水和Pra河水的样本进行核测试。<br>So they are also doing that so when they will come back from holidays I will get all the results in this area. ??? the microbiology and the nuclear test.<br>他们已经在测试了，所以在假期后，我会得到所有样本的微生物学和核测试结果。<br>But for now like I shared with you the other day I use a copper nitrite and converted into CuO copper oxide GANS and then used it to treat the Birim river, polluted river and the analysis is what I have to share with you today.<br>但是现在我将很高兴分享早前我用硝酸铜生成的CUO甘斯来处理被污染的Birim河水的分析结果。<br>In fact Nash should have joined us here but there are a lot of work for him because of the coming of the IAEA boss here. Mr. Yukiya Amano here, so a lot of work was filed on him and they have to do a lot. So he told me he’ll be here but he has not honored his word.<br>实际上，Nash本应该加入我们，但，因为国际原子能机构的主席——天野之弥的到来，他被分配了的很多的工作。所以，他跟我说他将在这里但是无法兑现他的诺言。<br>… maybe he is taking care of some other jobs you know that way piled up so.<br>可能他正在做一些其他的工作<br>But they have done a presentation and I’m ready to share.<br>但是他们写了一个报告，我准备在这里分享一下。<br>I’m going ahead … share screen … am I online? … Hello? … Hello?<br>Mr. Keshe:    我们正等着你开始<br>Mr. Keshe:    We are waiting for you to come up.<br>我要继续….共享屏幕……..我还在线吗？Hello？<br>Benjamin:    I have shared my screen.<br>Benjamin:    我已经共享了我的屏幕<br>Mr. Keshe:    Yes, but we don’t see anything. It’s just blank.<br>Mr. Keshe:    但是我们看不到任何东西。只是一个空屏。<br>Benjamin:    Is blank.<br>Benjamin:    空屏吗？<br>Mario Kienappel:    可能要等一会<br>Mario Kienappel:    It might take a few seconds.<br>00:55:01<br>Benjamin:So, if you can see now?<br>Benjamin:那么，现在看到了吗？<br>Rick:No.<br>Rick:没有<br>Benjamin:    Ok, stop share … and then share again … so … this can you see?<br>Benjamin:    ok，停止共享…..然后开始共享……现在看到了吗？</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:    Yeah, it’s coming up, yeah.<br>Mr. Keshe:    是的，出来了<br>Benjamin:    Ok, so that is the “Water Treatment Result” from Birim.The Results. Birim is one of the most polluted water bodies in Ghana as of now because I was thinking about [wrapping around my mind] why people go to that particular area to pollute the river.<br>Benjamin:    ok，那么这就是本杰明做的水处理结果。在加纳，Birim河污染最严重的河流之一。我在想为什么人们要到那个特别地方去污染河流。<br>And I came across a document from this guy Komla Dzigbodi-Adjimah “Geology and geochemical patterns of the Birimian gold deposits, Ghana, West Africa”.<br>我从一个叫Komla Dzigbodi-Adjimah的家伙那里看到了一个文档 “西非加纳的地质学和地球化学上的Birimian金矿分布”。<br>So, I found out that because of the gold in this particular river you can get gold and diamonds at the same time, (you know) what we call “Alluvial Diamonds”.<br>我发现由于在这个特殊的河流中的黄金，你可以同时获得黄金和钻石，我们称之为“冲击钻石”。<br>你可以在这个纯净的状态下得到纯净的钻石，所以，人们确实喜欢到那个区域去采矿。<br>So you get a pure diamond in its pure state, so people actually like going to this area to (you know) do the mining there.<br> And I remember when I went there the first time I took some pictures and then shared with Mr. Keshe and Mr. Keshe replied by he said “God save that …” (you know) “… country” (you know)<br>我还记得我第一次去那个地方时拍了些照片，并发给keshe先生，然后keshe先生回复说：“上帝呀，救救那个国家”<br>Because the water is really, really polluted.<br>因为河水真的被污染的很严重。<br>Then I have a gallon sitting in the office of Dr. Nana???<br>我有一加仑的河水样本放在Nana博士的办公室<br>When you open it, you can even (you know) smell. After closing it for some time, you see that the smell is very bad. So it’s really, really, really (you know) contaminated or polluted.<br>当你打开的时候，你甚至可以闻到。在盖上盖子一段时间后，你知道那个问道太难闻了。那河水是真的真的被污染了。<br>Birim river is a what you call it tributary to this river Pra as you can see on the screen.<br>在屏幕上可以看到，Birim河是Pra河的一个支流。</p>
<p>We have river Ofin and then river Anum and then river Birim.<br>我们有Ofin河、Anum河以及Birim河<br>And then this what you call it tributaries. When I say “tributaries” that means they are contributing to the Pra river before it enters into the Atlantic Ocean.<br>这些都是支流。我说支流意思是他们在流入大西洋之前会汇聚到Pra河。<br>And so people actually like (you know) mining. In all this area there are rocks. (you know) We call this rock the Birimian Rocks. And in this rocks there are huge deposits of gold.<br>因此人们喜欢到有这些石头的区域进行采矿，我们称这些石头为“Birimian石”。在这些石头中有着巨大的黄金储量。<br>That is why Ghana even was some time called a “Gold Coast”.<br>这就是为什么加纳有时甚至被称为“黄金海岸”。<br>Because I learned from history that the white men that came here the first time. When they walked on the coasts of Elmina which means in Portuguese “The Mine” and (you know) they were walking on gold, they were picking gold from the sea strand.<br>从历史上我了解到当白人第一次抵达这里，走在Elmina（在葡萄牙语中是矿的意思）海岸时，他们是走在黄金上，他们从海滩上捡金子。<br>And it recently also happened again that the same effect was witnessed again in the same place in Elmina that people, fishermen who went to shore suddenly (you know) started picking gold on the shore, on the sea shore.<br>近来在Elmina，同样的地方又发生了同样的事情也见证了同样的情况——渔夫突然来到海边开始在海岸上捡黄金。(you know)<br>So I mean, we are blessed with a lot of gold and that is where Pra actually enters into the sea. Elmina, the tongue of Elmina, if you can see it down.<br>我的意思是，我们被恩赐了许多的黄金，那就是Pra河的入海口。如果你能在地图的下面看到的话，就像Elmina的舌头。</p>
<p>Ok, so let’s go on:<br>Ok，让我们继续。<br>And last release I think, I was listening to the radio because is a huge discussion here in the media as I have already hinted and one of the guys, Mr. Benjamin Ambonza??? of the Water Research Institute (WRI) (you know) made a reference to this file that (you know) they are finding a huge problem of treating the water.<br>我想是上次发布，我正在听广播，那是一个媒体的大讨论，其中一个来自水研究所（WRI：the Water Research Institute）的人叫Benjamin Ambonza先生，其引用了这个文件，他们发现了水处理上的大问题。<br>And actually to hint Mr. Keshe about what is happening, …<br>实际上提示了keshe先生发生了什么事<br>The Water Research Institute (WRI) also working intended with us.<br>这个水研究所也有意与我们合作<br>That means what I’m doing they also doing the same thing and what I submitted the samples that I submitted to the laboratory at Gajeg???… they also had the same sample from me. using the copper oxide and they have requested to get another sample copper oxide GANS from me so that they can treat the water again. Ok?<br>这就意味着我们做的时他们也在做，我提交给在Gajeg的实验室的样品，也给了他们一份。他们已经要求我再提供一份CUO甘斯样品以便他们能够再次做水处理实验。<br>01:00:11<br>So that is what is happening in the interim. Ok.“What and Why is the WQI important?”<br>这就是这一段发生的事什么是WQI，为什么它如此重要？<br>The WQI is actually the abbreviation for “Water Quality Index”. Ok?<br>WQI实际上是水质指数的缩写<br>Water Quality Index is Reference for physical, chemical and biological idiosyncratic of water body. This distinctive aspect of water determines how far water can be used and the species and the ecosystem process can support it. Ok?<br>水质指数是水体在物理、化学以及生物学特质上的参考指标。这些特质决定了水可以在多长距离上使用以及物种和生态系统是否可以支撑它。<br>So that is the Water Quality Index. So we are looking at the physical, chemical and biological idiosyncratic. Ok. For now all that you have seen is mostly the physical and the chemical.<br>这就是水质指数。我们看的是物理、化学以及生物学特质。Ok，现在你所看到的大都是物理和化学特质。<br>The biological is what we are looking at from the lab of the Gajeg??? Microbiological Lab.<br>生物学上的指标我们正在等Gajeg???微生物学实验室的结果<br>And I was there the other time I started the process with this man ??? their lab who soon will give you the data as I have said earlier.<br>上次我在那里和这个人一起开始了这个过程，就像我之前说的这个实验室不久就会带来数据。<br>So Water Quality Index has a particular range.<br>水质指数有一个特定的范围。</p>
<pre><code>We have for a good water quality you get from 90 … between 90 and 100.
</code></pre><p>优质水在70至90<br>And excellent quality from 70 to 90.<br>良好的水质范围在90至100<br>50 to 70 is good.<br>50至70是好<br>Medium is from 25 to 50 and bad is from 0 to 25<br>中等水质是25至50，比较差的是0至25<br>The other the one Mr. Benjamin Ambonza??? was speaking … being interviewed on one of the radio stations, he made a claim that the water is so bad that it’s (you know) classified in this range.<br>另一位Benjamin Ambonza先生???正在讲话……在一个广播电台接受访问，他做了一个声明：在这些分级的范围里，这个水质是很差的<br>That is 0 to 25: Very bad.<br>是0到25：非常差的。<br>So that is what is happening here.<br>那么，这就是在这里所发生的事。<br>We have a huge problem here and they are looking for various ways of solving this problem.<br>???And when I could some of the amount ??? let’s you shake your head (you know).???<br>我们在这里有一个巨大的问题，他们正在为其寻求各种解决方案。<br>But like I said: Most of the things are also not within the power of the people to (you know) do it because they are political ??? with what is happening.<br>但是就像我说的：对于大多数的事，人民并没有权利来做，因为那些正在发生的事是政客所为。<br>Also because most of these guys doing the legal mining is the politicians and the people who are in power who supply these young people with some of these devices to pollute the river and they also guard them (you know) so you cannot touch them (you know). Ok.<br>做这些合法采矿的这些家伙大部分是政客，他们掌握着权利，提供设备给年轻人来污染河流，同时这些年轻人也在保护着这些政客，所以你很难接触到他们。<br>This are some of the determinant factors:<br>这就是一些决定性因素：</p>
<p>I you have a look on some of the results I’m trying to discuss this because most of you see some of this ???recent??? you don’t actually understand what it means and I’m trying to get it clear to you.<br>你们已经看到了一些结果，我会努力的来谈论一下，因为你们大多数人最近才看到这些，但实际上并不是很明白这些结果的意味的什么，我会试着把它们说清楚。<br>So these are the factors that determines the quality of a water:<br>那么，这些就是决定水质的因素：<br>That is … in some books you see it as “DiO”. DiO is “Dissolved Oxygen”, it’s the amount of oxygen that is present in the water.<br>那是….在某些书中你会看到它作为“DiO”。DiO是溶解氧，就是当前水中氧的总含量。<br>“Fecal Coliform” that is what the biological people are going to do: Bacteria are the most common microbiological contaminants of natural water. So this are bacterias (you know) fecal coliform are bacteria that are most common microbiological contaminants in natural water.<br>“粪便大肠杆菌”指标（就是生物学那些人要去测试的）：细菌是在自然水体中最普通的微生物学污染物。排泄物的大肠杆菌也是一种细菌，是水体中的最普通的微生物学的污染物。<br>pH is the numeric scale. As for pH I know many people have heard of it, is the numeric scale used to specify that water is acidic or alkaline (you know).<br>pH值是数字测量值。我知道很多人都听说过pH值，其数值表明水是酸性还是碱性。<br>So from 7 [up] going the water is alkaline and below that it’s acidic. So for example when you take a substance like vinegar, vinegar is 3.7 that is acidic and (you know).<br>7以上表示是碱性水，之下是酸性的。举例来说，当你拿一个材料比如是醋，醋的pH值是3.7，那么就是酸性的。<br>When you take a good quality water, that is distilled (you know) that is alkaline as ranges from 7 upwards. Up to 10, ok?<br>当你那一份优质的蒸馏水，其pH值的范围从7至10，对吗？<br>So that is the alkalinity range.<br>所以，这是在碱性范围。<br>“Biochemical oxygen demand” is a demand for measure of the quality of water used by microorganisms. So you also find that in some cases you see something like “BOD”. That is “Biochemical Oxygen Demand”. And it’ a measure of quantity of oxygen used by microorganisms either aerobic bacteria in the oxidation of the organic matter in the water.<br>“生物化学需氧量”是通过微生物来测量水质一种方式。你会发现，在某些情况下你看“BOD”，那就是“生物化学需氧量”。是通过水中微生物或是需氧菌来测量水质的一种方式，也是<br>“Temperature Change”<br>温度变化<br>温度变化会对生活在水中的像鱼或者其他水生动植物产生很多影响，<br>Temperature Change can have a lot of influence of the quality of life in the water like fishes and other aquatic bodies.<br> So it is a change of temperature in the water and it is either a natural change or a human driven event which can (you know) induce this temperature changes (you know)<br>那么水温的变化，既可以是自然地也可以是人为事件驱动的。<br>So when you put a lot of waste materials you can change the condition of the water and heat it. For instance by experimentation I have found that water is always … When water … for instance you take a water at room temperature which is about 25 degrees and then you add a little bit of sodium hydrochloride, you boost the temperature to about (you know) 30 plus (you know).<br>当你向水中放入许多废料时，你就改变了水的条件并加热了它。通过实验我发现，例如你在室温25的情况下向水中加入盐酸纳，这将使温度上升到30度以上。<br>So you increase the temperature. So, that’s a little bit of chemical in the water can also change the nature of the water.<br>那么，你增加了水温。就是那么一点在水中的化学品就可以改变水的性质<br>Total phosphate is the sum of the reactive and condensed phosphorus.he Total Phosphate is the sum of the total reactive and condensed organic phosphorous. And phosphate is actually needed for all organic life forms (you know) like plants and human beings.<br>“总磷酸盐”：  总磷酸盐是反应性和凝聚态磷的总和。实际上，磷酸盐是所有有机生命（比如植物和人类）都需要的。<br>“Total Phosphate”:<br>T01:06:50<br>[ The whole following paragraph is hard to understand because the beginning is something like “biologic” and the word “craps cycle” is unknown to me:]<br>If you aah ???biologic sense??? and you have heard about it ???craps cycle??? it’s to afford the ???craps cycle??? actually ???craps cycle??? is simple if you .. what you call it … somebody would take a lot of alcohol you get a hangover. And when you get a hangover the ???craps cycle??? actually needs water to complete it (you know) so you get a hangover.<br>（这整个后面的一段会很难理解，因为一开始就是像“生物学”和“craps cycle”等这些我不知道的词。）<br>“Nitrates”:<br>硝酸盐：<br>这是由氮和氧组成的无机化合物。就是NO3，一份氮三份氧，这就是硝酸盐。<br>These are inorganic compound made of nitrogen and oxygen. That is NO3, one part of nitrogen and three parts of oxygen molecules. So that is the nitrite, ok?<br>And too much of it in the water can be a lot of problem for the quality of water.<br>这种物质在水中太多的话会对水质产生很大的问题。<br>“Turbidity”:<br>浑浊度：<br>Which I explained the other time but I will explain it again:<br>以前我解释过，我再解释一遍：<br>“It’s a measure of the degree to which the water loses its transparency due to the presence os suspended sum of all solid and liquid particles”.<br>这用来测量水体由于其中的悬浮的固态或液态颗粒而失去其透明性的程度。<br>So that is in the liquid you see it as crystal clear liquid but (you know) they are solid, they are suspended in this aqueous or liquid liquid. They are particles that are hanging in and if you pass a light through the liquid then you can see through it or you put your paper, a paper behind it and you can read through then the water is said to be less turbid or (you know) is very clear.<br>在液体中你看到它们（像水晶般清澈的液体），它们是固体，它们是悬浮在水中或液体中的。它们是其中的颗粒悬浮，如果你让光线通过液体，你可以看到他们，或者你把一张你的论文放在液体的背后，你可以透过液体读到文字，那么就可以说这个水是不大浑浊的或是说很清澈。<br>In simple term turbidity is the clarity of the water.<br>简单的说，浑浊度就是水的清澈度。<br>So when you can not see through the water and it’s very opaque then you say the water is very turbid (you know) and you cannot see through.<br>因此，当你无法透过水来看东西，并且水很晦暗，你会说水很浑浊。<br>“Total Solids”:<br>“总固态物”<br>This is the measure … It is the measure of all the suspended and dissolved solid in water. So that is the measure of suspended or dissolved solid that is termed “Total Solids”.<br>这是要测量在水中的所有悬浮和溶解的固态物。<br>So if you come across these terms, that is the meaning of it.<br>那么如果你遇到这些条目，这就是他的意义<br>And these are the “Determinant Factors” that determines that water is either clean or unclean. And there are various widths that are used to determine (you know).<br>以上这些就是“决定性因素”，其决定谁水是否干净。<br>So we would learn about as we progress we will learn abou (you know) these determinant (you know) factors that are used in. (you know)<br>所以，随着我们的进步，我们将要学习这些用到的决定性因素<br>For instance we have the CC … Canadian … CC WQI (you know) that is the “Canadian Water Quality Index” (you know). The Canadian have got a nice (you know) formula for defining (you know) these determinant to check whether the quality of water is good or is not good.<br>例如我们有CC WQI就是“加拿大水质指数”。加拿大给出了一个可以精确的解释这些决定因素的很好地公式来检查水质的优劣。<br>01:10:01<br>Okay, the WHO have guidelines; so as you see in some of uhh, the results from – they have guidelines for which water is classified as clean or unclean.<br>好，“世界卫生组织”的指导原则；他们有水的洁净度分级的指导原则。</p>
<p>So we have health guidelines – these are the two [2] main guidelines – “Health guidelines, which take into account chemical and radiological constituents that have the potential to directly adversely affect human health.”<br>那么，我们有了健康指导原则——有两个主要的指导原则——健康指导原则是考虑化学和放射性成分对人们健康潜在的直接不利影响。<br>Okay, so uhh, in uhh the guidelines these are some of the things they look at; if the water is chemically clean and radiologically, you know, it passes the test, then it’s said that human beings can, you know, take it without no adverse effect.<br>在这个指导原则中他们会看几件事；如果这个测试的水在化学上和放射学上是干净的，那么，将会通过测试，这就是说人类可以无害的使用<br>“Acceptability guidelines, which include parameters that may not have any direct health effects but result in objectionable taste or odour in the water.”<br>“可接受准则”：在这项准则中没有直接对健康产生影响的因素但是水的口感或气味使人感觉很不舒服。<br>So for instance, when the water is more turbid that is, it’s unclear like the Birim water which you cannot see through, when a coin falls through it you cannot see it down, then we say it’s objectionable – the look of it will not even – you’ll not get the attraction of, you know, taste in it because it’s so turbid or it’s so dirty; and then when it’s – the more turbid it is, the probability that it will smell is in there (you know), so uhh, we look – the acceptability guidelines includes these parameters, you know, which directly also affect health but in objectionable taste or odour.<br>举例来说，当水很浑浊时，就像是Birim河水，你无法透过河水看见东西，当一枚硬币掉入水中，你看不到它的下落，那么这就是我们说的令人不舒服的情况——看着她就不会让你产生品尝的想法，因为太浑浊了，太脏了；当河水变得更浑浊时，可能在这闻起来就会太不舒服了。所以，我们看“可接受准则”包括的这些因素，也会直接的影响健康但气味和口感是令人很不舒服的。<br>You know, so if the water smells that means it’s not good. And these are the guidelines – two main guidelines that the WHO accepts.<br>如果水的气味不好就说明不是好水。这些就是指导原则——WHO接受的两个主要的指导原则</p>
<p>Okay, so they are like I said earlier weighted arithmetic method, you know, the WQI method that I used in determining, so this is a simple formula, you know, don’t be scared about the sigma sign, it’s just a summation – the summation –<br>我用WQI方法来确定水质的好坏，这个方法就像我早前说的加权算术法，是一个简单的公式，不要担心这个Σ符号，这只是求和<br>Okay, let me go gradually, the quality – “The weighted arithmetic quality index method classified the water quality according to the degree of purity by using the most commonly measured water quality variables.”<br>Ok，让我们逐步向前，质量——加权算数质量指数法能够通过测量水质变量得到水的纯净度从而对水进行分级。<br>And so, as you know the WQI is water quality index, and so, if you see the WQI is the quality index; and then for each parameter it is calculated using this formula, the quality index is equal to a hundred and then the estimated concentrated parameter of the analyzed water, that’s the “ith” last, you know, analyzed … within a given range the analyzed parameter of the water, and then VO is the ideal value of this parameter in pure water.<br>那么，WQI是水质指数。对于使用这个公式计算出来的每个参数，水质指数就等于100乘以被分析水样的估算浓度参数，这就是最终的“ith”，在一个给定范围内的水样的分析参数，然后VO是一份纯净水中这个参数的理想值。<br>And its ranges from pH which is acceptable, that is 7.0 like I’ve told you that is the acceptable range of alkalinity, and then DO which is the dissolved oxygen, you know, of uhh 14.6 mg/l and then we have the Si which is the recommended standard value of the “ith” parameter.</p>
<p>pH值的可接受范围，就像我告诉你的7.0是一个可接受的碱性范围，DO也就是“溶解氧”为14.6毫克/升，然后我们得到Si——“ith”参数建议的标准值。</p>
<p>The unit weight (Wi) for each water quality parameter is calculated by using the following formula which follows: The unit weight, which is the (Wi) for each water quality, is then calculated using the formula, uhh, the Wi and then divided by K over Si [Wi= K/Si], okay, where K is proportionality constant and can be calculated using the following, uhh, method; that is K= 1/Σ(1/Si) parameter, so this is the method that is used in calculating some of the things that you, you know, uhh, see on the sheets – the result sheets.<br>通过如下公式计算出来的每一个水质参数的单位权重（Wi）：Wi=K/Si，K为比例常量，它可以通过如下公式计算得出：K=1/Σ（1/Si），所以呢，这就是结果表单上这些数值的计算方法。</p>
<p>And in treating this water, because I’ve been treating a lot of people on various degrees of injuries, you know, I didn’t have enough of copper oxide, so what came to mind was to use the copper nitrate Cu(NO3)2 to be able to get nano material, to be able to treat the water,<br>在处理水的过程中，我处理了很多遭受不同程度伤害的人，我没有足够氧化铜，所以我就想到使用硝酸铜Cu(NO3)2 可以得到纳米材料用以处理污水。</p>
<p>So I used copper Nitrite to create the nano material I was using in treating that Birim water. And it gave us some interesting results:<br>所以，我用硝酸铜来得到纳米材料，然后用于处理Birim河水。这给了我们一些有趣的结果:<br>But Dr. Nash is not here, I hope it is clear and it can be seen, otherwise,<br>但是 Nash博士不在这里，我希望这个结果是清晰的并可以被看到，否则<br>M.T.KESHE    Can You open it up, please?<br>Is this for the sediment or is this for the water? Clear water?<br>M.T.KESHE：请你打开它好吗？<br>这个是沉淀物的还是水的？干净的水的？<br>Benjamin:    For the water.<br>Benjamin:      水的<br>M.T.KESHE    Is this, what we saw last time, last week?<br>M.T.KESHE：这是上个星期我看到的吗？<br>Benjamin：Yes, this is what You saw last time, but it is for  the Birim water. And actually Nash has not completed this one also. Because I gave him the sediments to  work on, and then also the “E.coli”, the biological  and “E.coli” ….<br>Benjamin：是的，这是你上次看到的，但这是Birim河水的结果。而且，实际上Nash没有完全做完，因为我给了他一些沉淀物让他去处理，然后也有“大肠杆菌”，生物学的和“大肠杆菌”……..<br>M.T.KESHE    When would we see the sediment?<br>M.T.KESHE：我们什么时候可以看到沉淀物的结果？<br>Benjamin：The sediment, You know Mr Keshe we need some time to… ( laughing)<br>It is not easy, working in an environment like this, …<br>Benjamin：这个需要一些时间（开笑），在这种工作环境下不大容易………<br>M.T.KESHE:    Can we see, what is the change, can You open it up further?<br>M.T.KESHE:    我们可以看一下有哪些变化吗，你可以打开上面一些的吗？<br>Benjamin：    Is it?<br>Benjamin：    这个吗？</p>
<p>M.T.KESHE：Ok, that is good. OK</p>
<p>M.T.KESHE：ok，很好</p>
<p>That’s the “Nuclear Chemistry and Environmental  Research Center“. OK</p>
<p>This is the drinkable guidelines for water. The W.H.O standards and then Ghana ??? Standards.<br>Benjamin：这个就是可饮用水的指导原则。这是世界卫生组织的标准和加纳的标准。<br>So, we are matching both parameters, you know…<br>我们正在做这两个参数的匹配。<br>I think, what You have done again, as before, You have put mixed columns again.<br>M.T.KESHE：我认为，你们做的这些，又像以前一样把列搞混了<br>Because it says ?total dissolved solid:“River Birim Control, 136”    “River Birim Treated 239”<br>因为就是说？总固态溶解物：“Birim河水限制值：136”“处理后的Birim河水：239”<br>The columns have been back to fronted!<br>这个后面的列放到前面了！<br>I think You better get this back to him and get this sorted , because it…<br>我想你最好把这个结果再给他做一下分类，因为这个…..<br>Benjamin：    Total solid … that is the W.H.O. range is 1000 …<br>Benjamin：    总固态…国际卫生组织的范围是1000….</p>
<p> No, You see the “Control” is 136 and then when You treated it it’s gone up to 239 ?<br>M.T.KESHE：不是的，你看“限制值”是136，然后你处理后上升到了239？<br>     I do not think, that is correct. Or is the conductivity that way?<br>我认为这不正确，或者这是电导率？<br>Rick:That was conductivity, yeah. The  one below it, we can see.<br>Rick：那是电导率，是，在它下面这个，我们可以看到。<br>The one below it, yes, sorry, the one below it.<br>M.T.KESHE：它下面的那个，是的，抱歉，它下面的那个。<br>Rick:“Total Dissolved Solids”:<br>Rick：“总固态溶解物”<br>Yes, that is the total TDS, that is the “Total Dissolved Solid”.63.5 and 11.61 – it′s gone way up for the treated water, is that correct?<br>Benjamin：是的，那个是总 TDS,”总固态溶解物” 63.5和11.61——处理后的水这个指标上升了，对吗？<br>It’s gone way up on the treated? Shouldn’t it bet the other way around?<br>Rick：处理后数值上升了？它是不是应该<br>No, normally the range is 1000?<br>Benjamin：不，正常范围是1000<br>No, no, we are not talking about the range! You see the figure 63.5 is in the wrong place,<br>M.T.KESHE：不，不，我们说的不是这个范围！你看这个数值63.5放错了位置<br>it should be in the other column.<br>它应该被放到其它的列中。<br>Benjamin:OK<br>Benjamin:好的<br>Mario Kienappel:    Or is it 11.61 ?<br>Mario Kienappel:    或者它是11.61吗<br>Benjamin:    Mr. Keshe, this is the … what you call it the “Control”. The “Control” is …<br>Benjamin:    keshe先生，这是……我们称其为“限制值”，“限制值”是……<br>Mr. Keshe:    Yeah, yeah, yeah, we understand that. There is some discrepancies on that “Total Dissolved Solid”.<br>Kehse:     是，是，是，我们明白。在“总固态溶解物”有一些不一致的地方<br>Benjamin:    OK, ok.<br>Benjamin：好，好<br>Mr. Keshe:    You understand? It’s 11.61 or is this 63.5?<br>Mr. Keshe:    你明白了吗？它是11.61或者这个事63.5吗？<br>Benjamin:    Ja … i’ll have them …. I will look at …<br>Benjamin:    我会把他们…..我会看一下<br>Mr. Keshe:    Get it checked! Because this is very … it’s the same with your “Calcium” at the bottom. And it’s the same with the “Magnesium”.<br>Mr. Keshe:    把这些值检查一下！因为这个非常….最下面的“钙”也是这种情况，还有“鎂”也是一样。<br>The figures have been put back to front!</p>
<p>这个图中后面的值放到前面了！<br>You gotta change your secretary. She could be dyslexic?<br>你必须更换你的秘书。她可能是一位“诵读困难症”患者。<br>Because we see the same thing again and again.<br>因为我们看到同样的事情一次又一次的发生。<br>An Institute at this level should not have this kind of mistakes.<br>这样一个级别的机构不应该有这样的错误。<br>Benjamin:    Actually … Mr. Keshe, Nash does a very good work. But you know he and one guy here they do a very good work. But …<br>Benjamin:    实际上，keshe先生，Nash的工作很出色。但是你知道，他和另一个人，他们他们做的很好。但是……<br>Mr. Keshe:    No, it’s just entering the data.<br>Mr. Keshe:    不，这只不过是数据登记。<br>Benjamin:    Entering the data … everybody is in a heavy ??? you know …<br>Benjamin:    登记这些数据……每个人的工作都很繁重，你知道……<br>01:20:11<br>Yeah but when you get them next time, do care it before you present it. Tell them they got to change it.<br>M.T. KESHE:是的，但是你下次拿到他们的数据，在展示前要小心。告诉他们他们需要改掉这些问题。<br>Because it’s very easy to see.<br>因为这个很容易看出来。<br>We see this with copper oxide.<br>我们用氧化铜来看。<br>So this way, the stability (?)  is very high here.<br>Benjamin：那么，在这里稳定性（？）很高。<br>Yes, if You look at the apparent colour, there is a huge difference. Even with the true colour, there is a huge difference.<br>M.T. KESHE：是的，你看表面的颜色，会有很大的不同。甚至与真实的颜色相比，也有很大的不同。<br>So, what You call it, there is a true difference. Even that the water is so polluted, so if You treat it, so You see, what You call it, the sediment are…..<br>Benjamin：所以，你称其为，有真正的不同。即使那个水已经被污染了，如果你对它进行处理，你会看到，你叫它，沉淀物是…..(没声音了)<br>( no sound)<br>Hello…??<br>M.T. KESHE：你好<br>Let′s see if he comes back, give him a few seconds….?<br>我们看一下，如果他能回到线上，就给他一点时间……？<br>If not, we can…because this is the last presentation, but we see the changes are huge.<br>如果不能，我们可以……因为这是最后的报告，但是我们看到变化是很大的。<br>Notice the calcium and notice the total magnesium.<br>注意钙和鎂的总量<br>The rhythm is in the wrong way and we come to the other part in the later presentation.<br>OK. He is not back<br>好的，他没有回到线上。<br>01:21:55<br>We lost it. Ya<br>We see the changes are very drastic. And You will come to understand exactly, what is going on later on in the other part of the teaching. This morning.<br>我们看到变化是很猛烈的。晚些时候，在其他部分的教学，你将会完全的理解发生的一切。就在今天早晨。<br>If You are from Japan, if You are from China, if You are from the west coast of the United States and if You are from Ukraine, or the center of the european section, the last part of the teaching today will shock You!<br>如果你来自日本、中国、美国西海岸和乌克兰或是欧洲中部，今天教学的最后部分将会震撼你。<br>We′ll shock You in a way, how there is a huge, huge way. How we as a Keshe Foundation People can bring that change about.<br>我们会用一种方式使你震撼，是一种巨大的，巨大的震撼。我们作为一位keshe基金会的成员如何能够带来那样的改变。<br>Can we go to Rennan? Is Rennan there, now that we lost Ghana?<br>我们可以回到Rennan那里吗？Rennan在吗，我们和加纳失联了<br>Rennan?<br>雷兰在吗？<br>01:23:00<br>Rennan:    Hi Sir, good morning!<br>Renana:在，先生，早上好<br>Good morning Rennan, You are doing a lot of work in the background, what is for us to learn in cleaning up the mess, we have created for ourselves. We can clean up very well.<br>M.T.KESHE：早晨好，Renann，你在背后做了很多的工作，让我们能够学到如何清理肮脏，我们自己创造。我们能够清理的很好。<br>We can manage to clean up our water, so water decontamination is one of the priorities when you look at this technology.<br>我们可以设法清洁我们的水源，所以如果你审视这项科技，水净化是我们优先考虑的事情之一。<br>One thing that we are still on going with that test right now, Sir, is for the air quality.<br>Rennan：现在，有一件事我们还在继续做测试，就是空气质量<br>Especially for the combustion of vehicles.<br>特别是对汽车的燃烧废汽。<br>And for the tests also for a bigger scale, eventually used … if we can use it with the vehicles, we can use it for all other engines or cole driven factories as well.<br>这是一个很大规模的测试，最终使用，如果我们能够把它用在车辆上，我们就可以把它用在所有其它的引擎上或是油动力工厂中。<br>We have made some prototypes for the system and just offer for the initial drawing for the decontamination systems for factories set up and I share screen…<br>我们制造了一些系统原型，并且对于工厂制造只提供净化系统的初始图，我共享一下屏幕……</p>
<p>第三部分笔译　　zch<br>01:24:05<br>So, this is the first … it’s just a concept that we are testing on.<br>这是首次的，我们的概念性测试<br>M.T.KESHE<br>We don′t see anything … You have not shared your screen.<br>凯史：我们什么都没看见，你的屏幕没共享<br>勒南:    Oh, Sorry … Is it coming out Sir? …<br>勒南:好了吗画面出来了吗SIR<br>M.T.Keshe    No… no, you’re not there.<br>凯史：没呢<br>01:25:00<br>(Sandor) Well, ???? screen to share, you also have to click on the submit button, the share button on the bottom.<br>桑德尔:好拉吗，共享屏幕，你应该也点击底部的共享按钮<br>勒南:    Yes, I already clicked it on, but my system, my zoom hanged for awhile. Maybe my bandwidth…???<br>勒南：是的，我已经点击，但是我的系统，我的调整一会，可能是我的带宽。。。<br>(瑞克) You may have to reshare and try to reshare…<br>RICK:你可能应该重新共享下，试着重新弄下。。。<br>(Benjamin) Mr. Keshe, I’m back. Sorry I lost this..<br>本杰明：凯史先生，我回来了，我掉线。。。<br> (Keshe) Hello. You are back.<br>凯史:好的，你回来了<br>(Renan) So, Mr. Keshe, I am having trouble in screen sharing for awhile.<br>勒南：这样，凯史先生，我在屏幕共享问题上要花点时间<br>(Keshe) OK, can we get sorted that  out because Benjamin is back while you are sorting that out. Is that OK with you Renan?<br>凯史：好的，我们能从哪里分出来么，当你处理的时候本杰明回来了 勒南好了吗<br>(Renan) OK, no problem Sir.<br>勒南：好的哦，没问题了先生<br>(Keshe) Thank you. OK. We see all your programs Benjamin! Hello, you are sharing now. Where have you gone Renan? Can you take off? You are sharing a screen. We see your drawing. Hello…???<br>凯史：谢谢你，好的，我们能看见你的画面本杰明，你在共享中，你去哪儿哪勒南，你能挪开下么，你在共享画面，我们看见你在打你好字样。。。??(好一团乱麻，如果不对照视频)<br>(Rick) Renan, did you mean to share the screen?<br>勒南:你的意思是共享画面？<br>(Renan) It was the delay so, can you help me Rick to remove it? As there is a delay…<br>勒南：有延迟，瑞克你能帮助我挪开么，因为有延迟。。。<br>(Rick) ??? There we go…OK, so (a bunch of mumbling, unimportant mumbling) OK…<br>瑞克：让我们。。。好的。。。巴拉巴拉巴拉一堆听不清的嘟囔<br>(Keshe) My god … Ahhh… When Benjamin comes, just hold him back…<br>凯史：上帝呀。。。呵呵，当本杰明来了，把他弄回来<br>(Rick) Renan??? There we go<br>瑞克：勒南，让我们。。。<br>(Renan) Yea, It has a very long delay. Maybe it’s my bandwidth…Right, OK, thank you.<br>勒南：好，延迟很高，也许是我的带宽。。。行了，好，谢谢你<br>(Keshe) OK. Renan. Let me give you a background to this before you start showing it.<br>凯史：好的，勒南，让我给你个背景材料当你开始介绍前</p>
<p>This, what Renan is about to show, … This is what one of the options which I’ve asked the Research and Innovation Center to look into.<br>这个就是勒南要介绍的，我得到的研发中心的研发选项之一。<br>One of the biggest problem at the moment is the exhaust which we disburse into the atmosphere. We are looking at a position possibility that we can dump the exhausts of the factories, the chimneys, into a basis made of GANSes, that in the process, we can extract the GANSes, what they call the poisoned material or the chemicals out of the air, and in that process, going through the GANS, will release clean air back into the atmosphere without any poisons or any other chemicals.<br>现在我们排入大气层的废气是个大问题之一。我们在考虑一个基于甘斯的可能的方法我们可以摆脱这些工厂和烟囱的废气， 这个过程里我们通过甘斯将空气中这些所谓的毒性、化学物质提取出，释放清洁的空气回到大气。<br>One of the uses of these can be for the exhaust of the cars, but this concept is part of the technology we are developing and it’ll be gifted to the Chinese government for the position we are in Beijing and Shanghai …<br>其中一种汽车尾气的使用法，是我们开发的一部分科技概念，将作为礼物提供给中国政府用于北京和上海。。。<br>It was not supposed to be shown, but now it’s on the screen, we can show it.<br>本不打算发表，但是已显示在屏幕上了，我们也可以展示。<br>This process makes a huge difference in industrial nations where chemicals are used and a small attachment on top of the chimneys or whatever, at the point of exhaust can be added that the GANS extracts the same chemicals from it.<br>这种方法使得使用化学品的工业国产生很大的改变，在烟囱上装一个小附属装置，诸如此类方式，这些地方的废气会被甘斯提取其中的化学排放。<br>There is no difference between this system and what you saw with Benjamin. Here, we deliberately introduce the poisons or the gases into the GANS where in the rivers the poison and the residual were already in the water.<br>这个（图示）系统会和你在北京看到的没有什么不同，我们郑重的推荐这种将毒气废气，江中的毒物和水中的废物吸收进甘斯的方法。<br>We add CO2 or Copper Oxide to separate them. So, it’s the same principle. It’s cleaning up the mess in a different way, chemically.<br>我们加入CO2或氧化铜去分隔它们，这样基于同样的意愿，不同于化学的方法，来清理脏乱，<br>01:30:00</p>
<p>And we are waiting and hopefully Renan can tell us explain to us more what is on the screen. Carry on, Renan.<br>我们等着希望勒南能够告诉我们解释给我们有关屏幕上显示的这些。勒南，到你了。<br>Renan: Ok. Thank you, Sir. So…  with this setup, so this is just a simple concept drawing for the decontamination or air cleaning. So it’s a bubbler type and i think most of us familiar with bubblers,  so we can resize  bubblers for chimneys, bars, and other exhaust, or gasoline, these cole engines that are still on the industry.<br>勒南：好的，谢谢凯史先生，那么，有关这个设置，这是一个简单的净化或说空气净化概念制图，这是一个喷口式的，我想我们大多数家庭都有喷嘴喷管，调整它门以适应烟囱汽车或其他的，工业的废油气排口<br>So with this we capture the smoke,  and when the smoke goes through the water,  this can be the energized water with GANSes that we mix, so that we can attract the heavy metals on the bottom<br>用这个装置我们捕获烟气，当烟气通过水，这些经过混合甘斯激励过的水（我的的理解就是所谓常说的甘斯水，甘斯化的水，就是做甘斯的时候的水，也应该可以是甘斯泡过的水，别倒掉用里面也有甘丝来做废气处理，他这里说的是混合甘斯不是特指哪一种，理论上混合多种过的水能吸附或说处理的的范围也越宽，这样理解吧，至于水中的甘斯的多少，没试验过不知道要不要有添加甘丝，里面的甘斯，只是过滤后再想要把甘斯洗出来估计……）<br>(01:31:00)<br>that we can drain out more early and add water more GANS water in it, in the certain period of time, not to reduce the water level.<br>…先排干净，加甘斯水，在一段时间内，不要减少水量<br>So that’s the concept that we are looking into, and we have made a small prototype, that is just for a trial for vehicles, so i can show you the small drawing, so what are the , so that’s the, this arrow the orange arrow is  the smoke, so it passes through  the chimney, the pipe,  and it’s an envelop with this container, and from this container this can be circular container,<br>对这个概念，我们已经做了个小原型，为小汽车实验的，给你们看它的图，在哪里去了，在这，这个黄色箭头是烟，通过烟囱口，管道，到封闭容器，在这容器循环<br>and air pressurized the water, and the air pushes back (6) and bubbles up, so all the bubbles will be accessed through the energized water or ?? 7: break) and we expect with a proper bubbling or a deeper water here in this drawing, … so this is not drawn to scale  so we are looking into a deeper level, water level. so that it can go deep on the bottom, and the GANSES that are staying on the bottom,  will attract or attach all the heavy materials that has been emitted by the combustion or the exhaust pipe.<br>废气压入水，气泡冒出来，气泡经过甘丝水，我们希望图表有一个合适深度的水位以便（净化）泡泡，设计图不是等比例的。我们正在设计合适水位深度，可能会更深，甘丝处于底部吸收通过燃烧（工业）或废气管来的重金属。<br>And from that , it comes out usually  without smoke, because steam will come out, so mostly steam will go out from that chimneys (9)  and then we drain out here on the bottom, the drain, there will be a periodic draining to get the particular minerals,  or particular materials that can still be used, because it ccontains heavy metals  in this area, it can be utilized   for different uses, so that’s the whole principle of this  design, and we just tried this in a car and we <br>经过处理，通常没有烟出来，只有蒸汽，然后我们周期性排干底部得到可再次利用的重金属，这就是设计原理，我们正在小轿车上实验。<br>(01:34:00)<br>It worked in the car was already an very old  second  hand  SUV  , and we tried it there.  once without the GANS first so we tried it  and all the it is expected.  we were expecting  that all these carbon,  the black smoke  will be  attached in the water, so as expected there was the water was darkened, and i  can show you the pictures,  let me first minimize …<br>我们在老旧的二手车上实验，首先我们没用甘丝希望黑烟，碳会吸入水中，，跟希望的一致水变黑了，我给你们看.我先最小化一下。<br>(01:34:00)<br>so this was the…. yes, can you can i stop share? … Yes, i will share another one here, only that.<br>那么这是，你能帮我停下吗，我想共享另外一张..<br>Hello, Vince, can you hear me?<br>[some sharing issues to be resolved一些共享问题解决中。<br>Ok, it is coming up 好了，来了…</p>
<p>01:35:08<br>So, this is just a very simple experiment that we did as you can see, we just used plastic bottles, and everything, just to test out.<br>You can see on the bottom<br>这是一个简单的实验，用的塑料瓶之类的…</p>
<p>this was the first one that we built, but what happened , was that in the container here , the water is too shallow, so it pops up all the water out, <br>这是第一次做的，水不够深，水溅出来了</p>
<p> so we just made some improvised smaller version , which we use<br> this one<br>所以这是改进版.加长…</p>
<p>So we just captured it and from there it is expected that all the particles will stick to the water.<br>我们用它来捕获，希望所有粒子吸入水中<br>One thing that is good with this: we put another air bubbler here, just an empty space, so that the water will not be allowed to go into the engine. This wont be needed in the chimneys, because the chimneys have a different smoke ??? so its going up and its not violent like the vehicle.<br>更好的是，我们加了个气泡器，这样水就进不了发动机，但是不能用在排气方式不同的烟囱结构上，<br>So, from this end up here we extracted some of the particles here that we need to test.<br>从底部我们提取了些粒子来测试（看是啥）<br>So the other test, which I have no picture yet  we already put Zinc plates , Copper plates, Nano coated copper plates  and Iron nails, rusty iron nails inside the water  with salt, so that we  can treat the gas of all the 3 GANSes inside during the process .<br>其他测试里，我们把纳米铜片，锌片.铜片，铁钉，锈铁钉和盐水放一起，看看这个混合效果（会有3种以上甘丝产生）<br>So  from that water that we receive we dont have yet results on the test , what are inside the water, what are the metals , that are captured and also  with the GANS, what are  if its concentrated  particles of heavy metals.<br>这种我们还没有结果，水里的是啥，这些金属会怎样，（产生的）甘丝捕获和浓缩的是否重金属。<br>So we expect heavy metals, because this is a very old vehicle which emits very black smoke and has not be tuned for so long already, so we still have to get the results on this one for the metals that have been harvested  in the system, so these are very practical<br>这是个很破旧没调校过的车，黑烟滚滚，这系统对它很实用，我们仍然在对金属片捕获的东西做鉴定。<br>So I share another one .让我们看看另外的。<br>Luigi:    Rennan, has anybody done emissions before and after a magrav unit installed in the car ?<br>路易：有人做过没有纳米化的车的这种排放测试没？<br>Rennan:  Yes, that one has no magrav yet, that was the control.<br>勒南：是的，有人做过，这是它的控制（系统？）<br>The initial is the control and that vehicle has no magrav , we did it without any upgrades  .That was purely an old vehicle , a 20 year old vehicle, and with no Magrav unit inside, no CO2 and everything.<br>有辆车没有纳米化，加过CO2甘丝什么的，没有过任何升级或改进是辆20年的初始控制系统的古董车。<br>That was the control test and we did another test with that still without anything  just to see what are the heavy metals that have been attracted into the water  with the GANSes and we will test it when we add all the other devices.<br>这段实在搞不懂他想说啥，，，是做了没看见或看见甘丝捕获了重金属。加设施以待继续做。<br>Because our other cars already have devices, so we started with a new vehicle which has no devices at all. We were doing that for that type of vehicle.<br>因为我们其他的车已经装备（应该是说装纳米化装置），所以我们用未装备过的新车来做，我们为这种新车在做的那些测试<br>Let me share让我们分享<br>(1:39 sound + picture missing in youtube)1:39分YOUTUBE声音加图片丢失<br>Yes we will be doing the emission testing such as this one.<br>是的，我们将做像这样的排气实验<br>The vehicle was not yet emission tested ,so we  will do an emission testing for the air instead of the water, so we are planning to have the air emission testing and also to have the water to be tested as well, what water we have absorbed or gathered in the bubbler.<br>这车还没做排放实验，所以我们做一个直接气体排气实验不用水，如此我们计划做排气测试也做水的测试（直接排气和用甘丝水过滤排气），看我们吸集到喷气过滤里啥样的水。<br>Yes we will test it with the emission testing.<br>是的我们将用排放测试来测验它<br>I have also done an emission testing with my vehicle which is already being with Magrav for 1 year .<br>我用我已经纳米化了一年的车做了排放测试<br>00:01:40<br>Already and I find it I don’t have the comparison for it yet because my car is already 8 yrs old. It’s already been… before I explain it I’ll show you first the Philippine standards for emission testing. (searches for file)<br>我发现我没有一个跟它的比较，因为我的车已经有8年车龄了，它已经。。。（有点老得意思），在我解释前我先给你们看看菲律宾的排放测试标准（搜索文件中）<br>So the emission standards here I am comparing is for In-Use Vehicles and I have my results and I compare the standards with my results because long before I have already had a problem with my carbon.<br>这儿是跟在用车（车龄较新）的规格比较，我用我的结果跟这种标准来比较，我的（车）的排放以前就很糟糕。<br>After a year of testing I can show you.. and you can see already? …<br>经过一年测试我可以显示给你看（图片），你看见了么？。。。<br>So I get this from our Philippine Emission Standards Certification of Conformity for Vehicles by the Department of Transportation and Communication (he shows Emission Standards and Certificates of Conformity for Motor Vehicles).<br>我得到了菲律宾交通运输部门的车检验合格证书（他显示了张机动车的排放规格检验证书）</p>
<p>So this is my basis : the emission standards for In-Use Vehicles with Spark-Ignition Engines. So we have a 0.5, volume which is acceptable.<br>这样基于这个燃气式发动机的在用车的排放标准，那么我们的0.5的值是不错的。<br>Page 036</p>
<p>Parts per million (ppm)  … hexane is 250.<br>百万分之一乙烷值250<br>This is my category: .5<br>这是我的车范围值0.5（他的车有至少8年车龄那么至少是2007年以前买的车，8年前新车标准也才3.5，8年后反而达到0.5了表示这车明显开挂了）<br>These are the previous years standards. This is already the new standard. They have already reduced this to 0.5 instead of 3.5., so the standard is becoming strict.<br>这些是以前的标准，这些是新标准，它们已经从3.5削减到了0.5，这就是说标准变严苛了。<br>So from that I have my vehicle lined up here..上面我的车的对应行<br>(can show you my … share button…) 给你看…共享确认…<br>Ok this was my emission test last January 8th 2016.我最后的测试是2016年1月8日</p>
<p>It has been 1 year with my Magrav so my carbon monoxide emission expecting a 2009 year model of vehicle, gasoline model, a Sedan, with a standard of 0.5, so I am only 20% below of the standard, so it is very low.<br>经过1年纳米化我的老爷车的一氧化碳排放企及了2009年汽油轿车0.5的车标，只有我这种车的原本标准的20%，这是非常低的值了。<br>This because I have no benchmark. I have no photocopy of the benchmark with last year but I expect it should have been having a greater emission .. so the whole year has been running with a Magrav car unit single coil only!<br>我没有一年前的这车的比较图表，我期望我的车有一个很棒的（碳）排放，我做的仅仅是一整年都在用一个单线圈磁引力场车用单元<br>Not the 3 coil, so the single coil only that is attached to my battery and partly a little of CO2 GANS powder on the engine.<br>不是3个线圈，仅一个单线圈接到（车的）电池上，和引擎上的一点CO2甘丝粉末（什么说法？加CO2到发动机里？还是说线圈上有甘丝作用到引擎里了）。<br>I did not put in the gasoline, on the engine oil, so … I only added that 1 time and so with this …<br>我没有往汽油或机油里放（应该是说甘丝）,只是，我仅加过一次。。。<br>Hydro Carbon is only 69, which the average standard is 250.<br>我的车碳氢化合物是69 标准是250<br>So it is very low and also very clean. So with only the Magrav car you can really check your emissions .. and check it out so that you’ll have a cleaner emissions eventually just adding the CO2 GANS in the engine itself and also using the MAGRAV Power Unit<br>这是很低的，也是很干净的，使用磁引力场能量单元，最终CO2甘丝会进入引擎，你可以检查你的排气，你会有个很清洁的排气。<br>01:45:00<br>So this is the effect on it, so I’ll be having another test later this month just to check if it has reduced more.  Just to see because I only test once a year to check for changing of registration so I’ll test it for another time within that year  so we can compare more on the vehicle.  Some of our group here have also been testing so we’re going to compare notes with the motor cycle emission tests.<br>这是有效的，我这个月迟些时候会做另一个测试，检查是否有更多降低，从注册登记起我仅测试了一年我还要继续测试一些时间，还可以测试更多车，我们的一些团队也有实验，我们会跟一些做过摩托排放测试的团队的记录比较。</p>
<p>MR K: Renan, what is on the CO2 reduction compared  if there was<br>凯史：勒南，CO2排放比较如何，如果有…<br>Renan: Ah, the CO2 sir, they dont put any readings on the CO2, only on the CO and the hydro-carbon, the hexane<br>勒南：啊哈，co2他们没有读数，只有co,碳氢化合物，乙烷。<br>MR K: On your CO what  would be the normal figure  Do you have one from last year?<br>凯史：你的CO是正常数是多少，有没有上年的数据。<br>Renan: Ah that is whats my problem.  A copy of last year I didnt have  I need to retrieve it first.  This is the latest one I have but it is expected for me that my 8 year old car should not have passed the emission test for this type of gasoline vehicle that I only standardly operate.<br>勒南：我的错，上年的数据没备份。还得弄回来，这是最后的数据，正常操作我的8年老车估计是无法通过的。<br>When I tested it last year, this January, that these are the results.<br>这儿是一月的测试结果（When I tested it last year这句联系不起来）<br>So I will test another one just to check if it is reduced already.  I will be expecting more reduction as the year goes by.  This is a one year use with the Magrav power already, .. not one year, only since August last year and we set it up  so not yet one year.<br>因此我要测试另外一个看看是否有减少，今年过来了我想会有更多降低.使用了一年能量单元了…，哦不满一年，从去年8月开始。<br>MR K : What is important to see that figure from last year if you can retrieve it.<br>凯史：看去年数据是重点如果你能取回来。<br>Renan: I will get it from the LPO   I have not made a copy of it.  I was looking for it  I thought I had a copy at my office  I can get another copy by Monday just to compare January.<br>勒南：我会从LPO取来，我还没拷贝，正在找，我想我的办公室有，我星期一取另外一个一月拷贝来对比。<br>MR K: I dont think you will see much difference.  What is important is to see the last year<br>凯史：我不认为会有很大差异，看去年数据才是关键。<br>Renan:  Ok I will get a copy from last year.<br>勒南：好的我得取去年数据。<br>MR K : If you can get from last year then we can understand a comparison of actually what was before and what is now.<br>凯史：如果你取得去你读数，我们才能明白一个准确比较，多少是去年的，多少是现在的。<br>（如此基本结论这种实验是纳米化过的车直接排放会都有一个明显改善，而甘丝水过滤系统对任何车或其他排放都有明显排放改善，注意我们必须关切这种过滤系统，当灾害来临时污浊的甚至有带辐射成分的空气需要这简单高效方法解决问题。）<br>Renan:  Also Douglas has made some for cleaning the air for the car as well  just to maintain and he has also achieved a reduction in the fuel.<br>勒南：道格拉斯也做了汽车的排气净化，能净化也能减少油耗<br>MR K: Can we have Douglas on the line?<br>凯史：道格拉斯在线？<br>Renan: Hello Douglas, are you there? He is not there so I will present it for him.  Let me share ..<br>勒南：道格拉斯，在吗，哦不在，我替他…让我们看来…<br>So, i tried new share, did it come out?<br>那么，新内容显示出来了吗？<br>Mr. Keshe:    Ja, we see it, it says Nano and Gans MaGrav Technology.<br>凯史：嗯，看见了，显示：纳米和甘丝的磁引力场科技。</p>
<p>“纳米和甘丝的磁引力场科技、车辆水气净化系统“<br>Renan:    Ok, so Douglas used this system  itS been on the internet already.<br>勒南：道格拉斯用这种系统，放上了网络。<br>The copper scrubbers intake automobiles for performance. So he used it with using 6 nanocoated copper scrubbers, using the caustic steam method and some 9 neodymium magnets for the air intake as well.<br>机动车性能提升的净化吸纳铜，他使用了6片纳米净化铜，苛性减熏蒸法和9个钕磁铁在机车进风口。</p>

So this was used – uhh Nano coated by caustic.<br>二部分用胶带将纳米铜和磁铁覆盖整个进气道，有点像碱液做的（整个进气道的）纳米层（假设下将整个进气道用纳米铜直接做成比这种附加覆盖层的方式兴许更轻更有效？就是纳米层消耗情况如何，更换频率如何？）<br>And this is the air intake area which opened up and removed the air filter and put it under (1:50:46-1:50:48)<br>如图这是打开的空气过滤器区，空气过滤装置（制作的）移开了放在过滤器底部（图片模糊看不清，第一部分的具体结构描述不清晰）</p>
<p>1:51:00<br>So thats the simple (??? 1:50:49-1:50:52) results was he got extra 35 miles per a tank full with Nano scrubbers.<br>简单测试结果显示一箱纳米进化铜可额外多增加35公里（每箱子油，因为看图上说原315公里增加到360-365）<br>And hes now adding Co2 GANS also in his fuel, but thats achieved for at least 45 extra miles per tank full. So thats for the Nano scrubbers and with additional of a Co2 GANS.<br>然后他加C02甘丝到油箱，增加到多45公里</p>
<p>So the Co2 we only use about 10 to 15 ml of washed Co2 in all the tests that we make; very little, very little, and I want to show a video just to show you a video of what happened to my vehicle right now that is uhh, moving, driving without – it is moving without stepping on the accelerator as you maybe have experienced some of you, so ill just show the video; can you share the video?<br>我们应用10到15毫升洗净的CO2甘丝，很少的量，我给你们看看我的车视频现况，不踩油门的移动状况，你们也可能有这经验，看见了吗？<br>1:52:0<br>Okay? (1:52:09-1:52:19) so the condition here is, with the MaGrav unit just installed to the vehicle and some of CO2 GANS for the past – less than a year, almost a year, you can see I only press the clutch – this is a manual vehicle, so I only press the clutch and it just moves by itself without pressing the accelerator;<br>这车使用能量单元和CO2甘丝不到一年，你可以看到我踩离合，这是手动车，车在开我仅踩离合不加油的样子</p>
<p>So were just cruising about 10 kilometers per hour, so its like moving like an automatic car. So I also tried this<br>我们在以10公里时速前行，就像自动档汽车（一般手动挡车1档踩离合同时配合加油，车才能起步开动，开动后换二档加油提速，速度够了再换更高档进入较高速度行驶，视频应该是是车起步后不加油以1档在怠速前进，一般这个时候不踩离合车速也少有10公里时速，而不加油并踩离合则会减速直到停车，选择不加油并松开离合则有可能因车速太低，发动机怠速时的动力不够带不动慢车而熄火，这个时候不加油并踩离合而车子奇葩的以10公里时速跑则是在开挂，相当于每秒3米，等于人在中等速度在跑，不加油即便自动档车虽不会熄火但一般怠速也少有超过10公里时速。）<br>1:53:00<br>and uhh, driving in a steep fly-over, a (1:53:07) so you can, so I observed just touching the clutch, I just do some little push on the clutch, it – what happens was it builds up its strength – its fuel<br>啊哈，在飞跃陡坡哈，你看，我轻踩离合，有什么状况，（引擎）它有自己的力道，它的能量</p>
<p>then from building up it can go up to an uphill even without pushing the gas, so its producing its fuel by itself, inside the engine so Im expecting it like it may be creating a hydrogen gas, because of the plasma that is being produced by the coils and spread around the system so.<br>从加装过滤后不加油也能爬上坡，所以（认为）发动机制造了它自己的燃能，我想它可能产生了氢甘丝，能量线圈产生等离子体并散布在到整个（引擎）系统。（都是自认为，姑且说纳米化的车配合纳米化进气的效果吧）<br>Vince:    Renan, that was indeed – you werent able to do that before, correct?<br>文斯：勒南，确实如此，你以前做不到是吧。<br>1:54:00<br>Renan:    I have never done that before, [laughs] I just had that, just lately this month, before my car just switched off after I removed the clutch, so its just stalled.<br>勒南：我以前没有做到过，上个月才做到的新鲜出炉的…之前松开离合就失速熄火。<br>Yes you are correct, so it usually stalls, then I was shocked – suddenly I just had in my mind: Why not try to let it move without  (1:54:26) because I can feel the engine is already strong, so it has already built up some strength and is I think – theres additional fuel that is being provided even without the.. uhh, putting any accelerator, so I just let it move,<br>你是对的（以前不行），通常熄火，那次我突然灵光一现：为什么不试着开并不…（不踩油门），因为我感到发动机变动强劲了，建立起了某种强度，相当于额外的油产生了并不用…呵呵…不用任何踩油门，让车开起来。<br>So that was since March 1, and right now its been 24 days; I still do it and Ive tried it already in an uphill. The engine produces its own hydrogen, and it cruises through the uphill.<br>从3月1日到现在有24天，我仍然在做上坡实验，（认为）引擎产生了氢从而爬上来坡。</p>
<p>第四部分笔译　　为中（馄饨）<br>01:55:00<br>So just use the clutch to let … [sound off] … nola??? just a slow steady going up. Then just use the clutch just to give the gears proper … not to heavy load and when you remove the clutch … it’s like giving a kick, it’s going to kick the car up and it just ???flues???<br>So, I went to the shop this day with Verni. we checked out the car and the mechanic our friend the mechanic, he said that it has already built up its power. That’s why there is extra fuel that is being produced that it’s not the gasoline anymore so there is building off a different fuel which I expect it’s hydrogen inside the engine.<br>Because the air moist that’s coming in and the water or anything that will be produced there.<br>Also the thing that I have observed it’s already ???minor??? exhaust pipe as well is … sometimes there is water that will come out.<br>01:55:00<br>因此仅仅使用离合器让… [声音没］… nola？？？只是慢的稳加速。只是然后仅仅使用离合器给齿轮适当的…不是对重负荷当你松开这离合器…它是像给小冲力，它要向上踢汽车开起来？？？烟洞？？？<br>因此，我这天以 Verni 去商店。我们检查汽车，我们的朋友机械工，他说它已经建立它的力量了。那是为什么有被生产的额外的不是汽油燃料，它有了不同的燃料我期望是引擎内的是氢。<br>因为内部空气潮湿进来或水或者什么在那里被生产。<br>我已经观察它的事物也是？？？稍有？？排气管恐怕好象是…有时有会出来水。<br>So I observed that before and right now I still observe it that it comes out.<br>And that’s one thing I have observed for this time. So with today we just upgraded the system. We used another update which we added some of the different features just to reduce the fuel consumption and to make it so efficient and also to have lesser ???stilo??? CO2 or carbon dioxide/monoxide emission.<br>So that’s why I will test it again because I added a very simple system that can also supplement the Magrav power.<br>So, there is the Magrav there and we have a very tiny systems the same as the … [sound off] …<br>sorry, I will show you here, sorry … share … ok …<br>So this is the new upgrade just today. So the existing Magrav system we also put this just to … our goal is to have still efficient fuel consumption so we need to have efficient power for the systems.<br>We put this as small coil as well. Not only in the battery at all anymore so the Magrav is on the battery. Now we put this directly to the ignition coils at the point of the plugs of the spark plug.<br>For this is for gasoline engine.<br>Those are tiny coils, double core coils that we always make for our pens. And we just use the pens [??? one word missing ???] to the Magrav to make it more efficient.<br>Page 043<br>因此我以前和现在在观察它，我仍然观察到它出来。<br>这是一件我的观察。因此与今天我们刚刚升级系统。我们另外增加一些不同功能的的更新以减少燃料消耗而且让它如此有效率而且有比较少的？？？stilo？？？CO2 或二氧化碳│一氧化物排放物。<br>这也是我为什么再次测试它，因为我增加一个非常简单的系统，也能补充 Magrav 力量的。<br>那里有 Magrav ，而且我们有一个非常极小的系统相同于这… [无音］…<br>对不起，我将在这里展示它…分享… ok …<br>这是今天新升级。因此现有的 磁引力 系统我们也仅仅达到这…我们的目标仍然是有效率的燃料消费，和系统更有效率的动力。<br>我们放了小线圈。不仅有电池，不仅如此， Magrav 在电池上。现在我们在点火器（火花塞？）插座上也有塞子，。<br>为这是给汽油引擎。<br>那些是极小的卷，双核线圈，这是我们用来制笔的线卷。而且我们仅仅使用笔［?？？一个字不见的？？？］对 Magrav 让它变成更有效率。</p>
<p>So as 3rd testing after adding this, after adding this device, I did [??? some words missing ???] and i’m expecting another decrease in my fuel consumption and also in the clean-up on my combustion. That’s why I will test it again with this new system attached on it because I have felt the car, when I drive it, it’s already different than I … when I drove it … a week ago or even two days, that was very different. So when I arrive with the car there without this I can feel the difference when I … it was added immediately.<br>So …. to help to protect the environment eventually for the gases that come out so even without having too much things that we add on our existing vehicles, we don’t have … especially in other countries that don’t have electric.<br>So this is the … as you can see there is a letter “N”<br>So this is another one we have applied. Which is very useful as well.<br>That is a very tiny neodymium magnet. Just to put on the fuel line.<br>So, just to clean-up the fuel line that comes in. So it helps.<br>因此当做第三个测试在增加这一个装置之后之后，增加这我做［?？？一些字不见的？？？］而且我正在期待我的燃料消耗方面的减少以及在我的燃烧物的扫除中。那是因为我感觉汽车，我为什么再次在它这个新系统测试它，因为当我驾驶它，比…当我驾驶它…一个星期前或者甚至两天，那非常不同。因此当我不装这个驾驶汽车时我能感觉不同…它立刻被增加上。<br>如此….为帮助最终的保护环境，而不产生太多的瓦斯出来，因而我们加装在我们的现有车辆，我们没有…尤其在没有的其他国家电。<br>这是这…当你能见到，有字母 “ N”<br>这是另外一个我们已经应用的。它是一个非常有用的。<br>那是一个非常极小的钕磁铁。只是穿上燃油线。<br>因此，仅仅去清扫进来的燃料线。它有帮助。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>There is something interesting while you mentioned something about the new car. At the moment … before the hybrid cars … or when you had a second hand car, you could sell it and there was a market for it to export it into 3rd World Nations.<br>02:00:00<br>Hybrid cars are becoming a stagnating point for the manufacturers. They are very good for people to buy, but when you have a 10-15 year old car, it has just been the tradition to export it into Africa for example.<br>Nobody needs hybrid, because there is no electricity in Africa to support hybrid cars and the repair of them. Electric cars are actually “no go”.<br>The knowledge of it is not there. So, we are seeing these kind of new technologies are worth to be supporting it.<br>Keshe 先生：你提的新汽车的事是有趣的。此刻…在混合动力汽车之前…或当你有二手汽车时，你会卖它而且它有市场输出进第三个世界国家。<br>02:00:00<br>混合动力汽车成为制造业者的淤塞点。他们非常容易让人们买，例如当你有 10-15 年的汽车时，正好输出它进入非洲的惯例。<br>因为在非洲没有电力来支持混合动力汽车和他们的修理，所以没有人需要混合动力汽车。电车实际上 “ 没有跑 “ 。<br>这个知识不在那里。因此，我们正在见到这些种新技术是值支持。</p>
<p>And it has become a big problem for manufacturers now that the first generation of hybrid car is slowly becoming to age, second hand to be resold. It only can be sold within the countries which have the facility to support repair to start with and secondly, with the electric cars, are doomed cars, that’s it.<br>It cannot go anywhere else. So, these kind of conversions become essential into the process that if we can extend the use of the car in the third world nations, which reduces consumption.<br>How much fuel reduction have you seen compared to last year?<br>R:  with the magrav system I have an average of 25% , with the magrav and the CO2 with my driving, how I drive .That’s my average for my fuel consumption for the past few months that I  test always 25%, so …<br>而且它现在已经成为制造业者的一个大问题，混合汽车的第一代慢慢地变成变老，二手车已经开始转售。它不过只能在有能力修理的国家，而且第二，由于是电车，是被注定淘汰的汽车。<br>它不能够去任何地方。因此，这些种转变变成必要的过程，如果我们能在第三个世界国家中继续汽车的使用，这可以减少浪费的。<br>与去年相比较你已经见到节约多少燃料？<br>R：由 magrav 系统，我平均节约有 25% 的, 由 magrav 和有我的驾驶用的 CO2，无论如何我开车。那是我总是测试 25%, 是如此的过去几个月的我的的平均燃料消费。。。</p>
<p>K: how many km?<br>R:  about 27l, I can travel about 200km, so that’s 27l with 200km<br>K:  how much was it before?<br>R:  before it is 27l will only drive 160km.<br>K: so you get more or less 1.5km per liter more<br>R: yes, even in traffic I still have the standard, because I know already how to press the gas not too much, because it’s already powerful, so it helps me really safe as I go along to know the car, the engine.<br>So, but when I drive a long drive I can save almost 40-50% if I drive far  100km away and go back I save so much, but in the city driving that we have, there is always traffic jams, I get 25% on average.<br>K: OK, anything else we can learn from you?<br>R: that’s all right now Sir, I continue to do the other decontamination processes and some of the desalination processes too<br>K: That figure from your certificate last year is very important, if you can let us see it next week<br>R: I’ll get it next week.<br>K：多少公里？<br>R：大约 27 升，我能旅行大约 200 公里，所以用 200 公里是 27 升<br>K：以前，它是多少？<br>R：以前它是 27 l 之前将会只驾驶 160 公里。<br>K：因此你每一公升更多或多或少多走 1.5 公里<br>R：因为它已经很有动力，我有标准，所以因为我已经知道该如何压瓦斯不太多 ，因为它已经很有动力，在引擎上我更知道这车，它帮助我有真正的安全，，，。<br>因此，但是当我长距离驾驶我能几乎节省 40-50% ，如果我开车到100 公里之远而且回去，我节省如此多，但是在城市推进的时候，一般说来，总是有塞车我有 25%。<br>K：好，我们还能从你学习其他事物？<br>R：那现在是可以了，我继续做其他净化处理，和一些 淡水化处理<br>K：从你去年的证书的那一个图表非常重要，如果你能就让我们下个星期见到它<br>R：我将下个星期拿它。<br>K: thank you very much indeed<br>Cleaning up the Mess with Fukushima<br>OK, now we come to another point of these teachings how we are cleaning up the mess, how we’re going ahead in cleaning up different processes.<br>What I would like to tell you or to take you back is:  if you remember a couple of years ago, over a year plus, we got involved with E.coli and Ebola.<br>A couple of years ago, when we gave the technology, the knowledge we thought the scientists of Sierra Leone University to build a system and then use the material of the CO2 on Ebola , which was killing thousands of people, according to the World Health Organization.<br>When they took the system to the capital and they took it to be shown to.<br>At that day of presentation in the presidential palace happened to be someone from MIT, which we saw later on [that] MIT used the knowledge, to confirm the correctness in so many different ways, but [under] the name of MIT.<br>K：非常谢谢你清理福岛上的麻烦。好，现在是另点我们的清洁问题的这些教学的，如何我们如何在不同的方式上面对清洁方面改进。<br>我想要告诉你下回是：如果你一些年前记得，我们有大肠杆菌和伊波拉病毒的麻烦。<br>当我们提供技术，知识依照世界卫生组织，我们想塞拉利昂大学的科学家建立一个伊波拉病毒上使用 CO2的系统，伊波拉病毒正在杀害数以千计的人们的的材料。<br>当他们将系统带到了首都，而且他们拿它被显示到。<br>那天在总统府的报告的 是从麻州理工学院来的某人，我们看见麻州理工学院用的知识，在从这么多不同的方法中确定正确性，但是［在］麻州理工学院之下的公司。<br>Then the equipment from the Scientist in south Sierra Leone University was confiscated.<br>And they were told they cannot carry on with the test because they showed the correctness of total eradication of Ebola. Then, what they did, the scientist went back to the university and with arranging with the other scientists and support teams they built the second unit and they tried it on E.coli and they cultured it.<br>And after 24h there was no E.coli.<br>02:05:00<br>So, we had an idea that the systems can be used for virus and bacteria’s in different ways.<br>Then I bring you back to further time, when we started the teaching two years ago.  Two years ago in Keshe Foundation about the May of two years ago, we had a lady with us called Yococo. Yococo took the technology what we saw the Spanish brushes that we’ve just seen for  air pollution in the car and Gans materials and she flew to Japan because that was her home. She was concerned about contamination from Fukushima. She published papers, she spent three days, most of us stayed life while she was testing, we guided her. These are the pictures.<br>I asked if that is available, you can see it, this is live from Fukushima.<br>然后在塞拉利昂南部大学的科学家的设备被没收了。<br>而且他们被告知不能够继续测试因为他们显示出伊波拉病毒的整体根除的正确性。然后，这些科学家回    大学，而且与和其他支持的科学家安排，第二次联合成个单位，而且他们在大肠杆菌上尝试它，而且他们栽培了它。<br>而且在 24 h 之后，没有大肠杆菌。<br>02:05:00<br>因此，我们有了让这个系统以不同的方式用在病毒和细菌的主意。<br>然后下一步时，当我们从两年前开始教学。两年前的五月在Keshe 基金会中，我们认识一位女士叫做 Yococo。Yococo 带着汽车中的空气污染和甘斯材料技术象我们见到的西班牙刷子飞回她的家日本。她关心福岛的污染。她发行文件，她用了三天，当她正在尝试时，我们大部份在生活，我们指导了她。这些是照片。<br>如果那是有效的，我说，你能见到它，这是福岛的生机。</p>
<p>A lot of you saw this. And this is her beautiful face …</p>
<p>And what she did. A lot of people may complain about it, but what happened in the background, this video raised a lot of questions for the Japanese Government.<br>How come this lady has come and how effectively she shows it<br>Then they knew there is a solution. And then we saw a process which a lot of you are aware of  and a new dimension has come out of this.<br>A lot of you, a few months ago, saw a man, …  you heard a man, who was after Yococo did this Fukushima experiment, … brought to the attention of the TEPCO that there could be a solution.<br>So TEPCO, as I am an Iranian nuclear physicist could not approach us set up a decoy.<br>And that decoy is on the table now. He is going to explain to you himself what has happened and a lot of you by the end  this session will ask of one thing which is what happened through my head when as I saw it:<br>她做的。许多人可能抱怨它，但是什么在背景方面发生了，这影像给日本政府提出了许多疑问。<br>这一位淑女的到来带来什么和多大影响<br>然后他们知道有解决。然后我们看见进程，许多你知道，而且新维度已经从这出来。<br>许多，几月以前，看见一个男人，…你听到一个男人，是在 Yococo 后做了这福岛实验之后， .。。带来TEPCO的关注。<br>因此 TEPCO，因为我作为一个伊朗的核子物理学者无法接近我们建立的一个捕获器。<br>而且那一个捕获器现在在桌子上。他要向你解释他自己什么已经发生和许多结果，当我看见它时，我的头脑里有一件事物的问题是这一会议发生过什么：<br>I asked for the resignation of the Japanese premier minister.<br>Because he has betrayed his nation. We go through it and let’s see if we’re correct. Because a lot of you who live in America and who live in Central Europe and a lot of you who have the possibility of being contaminated by the radioactive material. A lot of you who go to the hospitals and you are given radioactive material injection, or radiation injection for different medical purposes, you do not know what is going to happen to you with the radiation in your body, how much it’s coming out and what it does.<br>We have a solution. Listen to it!<br>Can I ask Rick if he can promote the blues cross please.<br>That he can present his.<br>Can you see him online?<br>Ok if you can stop the pictures from Yococo please and allow him to share his screen.<br>Mr. Khan welcome to the Keshe Foundation.</p>
<p>我要求日本第一的部长的辞职。<br>因为他已经出卖他的国家。我们通过它让我们看看是否我们是正确的。因为许多你谁住在美国和谁住在中部欧洲和许多有被放射性的材料污染的可能性的你。许多你谁去医院和你有放射性的物质注射，或不同的医药的目的的放射性注射，你不知道用你的身体的放射后什么要发生在你身上，多少它会出来和它做多少。<br>我们有解决。听！<br>能不能请他促进蓝调十字会，我问瑞克。<br>他在？。<br>你能在线见到他吗？<br>好如果你们能从 Yococo 停止照片请而且让他分享他的荧屏。<br>Keshe 基金会欢迎可汗先生。<br>It is the second time we see us in the past month. You showed us the use of the machine from measuring Magrav System in Japan.<br>Mr. Khan is Councillor of the Keshe Foundation of Japan. He is the head and partner in the Keshe Foundation Japan. And he is one of the most trusted people Japanese could ever trust. Even though he is Turkish by origin. He is in Japan,  he is fluent in Japanese speaking and his company was set up to be the intermediary between TEPCO and the Keshe Foundation. And I leave it to him to explain how he came to us and how the process started.<br>Mr. Keshe: Are you there Mr. Councillor?<br>Hello, Hello can you unmute yourself?<br>Mr. Khan: Hello…..<br>Mr. Keshe: Yes we can hear you, can you speak a bit louder, please?<br>Mr. Kahn: Yes.<br>Mr. Keshe: can you share your screen, share your screen without your programs to be seen, open up, what you’re going to show us first and then share a screen please on the zoom.<br>MK – Is that OK with you?<br>02:10:00<br>我们在过去的一个月内第二次见到我们。你在日本给我们看测量磁引力系统机器的使用。<br>可汗先生是日本的 Keshe 基金会的成员。他是 Keshe 基金会在日本的领头人和合伙人。而且他是最信赖的日本人之一，可一直信赖。即使他是起源的土耳其。他在日本，他的日本语是流利的，而且他的公司是作为 TEPCO 和 Keshe 基金会之间的仲裁者建立的。而且我让他解释他是如何走近我们和如何开始运作的。<br>Keshe 先生：你在那里吗？议员先生？<br>哈罗，哈罗你能静止自己？<br>可汗先生：哈罗．．．．．<br>Keshe 先生：是的我们能听到你， 你能大声点，请？<br>卡恩先生：是的。<br>Keshe 先生：能你分享你的荧屏，分享的你的荧屏被见到，有话直说，什么是你要展示给我们，然后分享一个荧屏在ZOOM上,请。<br>MK 它好了？<br>02:10:00</p>
<p>M. Kahn – Yeah. Trying to figure out the…<br>MK – We need you to speak a bit louder.<br>M. Kahn – Yes sure.<br>MK – OK I can hear you clearly thank you. Good morning Mr. Kahn. It’s a pleasure to have you.<br>M. Kahn – You can’t see my thing right, can you see?<br>MK – I cannot see, you got to go on “Share Screen” button, the green one, press, and then you should be coming up.<br>M. Kahn – Yeah.<br>MK – While he’s trying to do I’ll tell you what TEPCO has done for this man who’s helped  Japan so much:<br>They have sacked him, they put him on the street and they have made sure he cannot have a job in Chi… in Japan!<br>They are making sure that this man has not the bread to eat and feed his children and the Keshe Foundation is there to support. He is part of the Keshe Foundation in Japan and you will be amazed what is going to be described now. Go ahead please Mr. Khan, the floor is yours.<br>M. Kahn – OK see my screen now?<br>Page 048<br>M. Kahn－是的。尝试理解这…<br>MK －我们需要你更高声地说一一点点。<br>M. Kahn－是的确信。<br>MK －好我能清楚地听到你谢谢你。早安卡恩先生。很高兴有你。<br>M. Kahn－你不能见到我的事物，你能见到吗？<br>MK －我不能够见到，你开始继续进行 “ 分享荧屏 “ 按钮，绿色的，按住，然后你应该发生。<br>M. 卡恩－是的。<br>MK －当他正在尝试做，我将告诉你TEPCO对他做了 什么，这个已经为日本帮助这么多的这一个男人做了什么：<br>他们已经解雇他，他们把他放在街道，而且他们已经确定他不能够在 X 中有工作…在日本！<br>他们正在确定这一个男人没有面包吃和喂他的孩子，Keshe 基金会在那里支援了他。他在日本是 Keshe 基金会的一部份，而且你将会被现在描述吃惊的。请愉快前进Mr. Khan，地位是你的。<br>卡恩－好的 M. 现在见到我的荧屏？</p>
<p>MK – Yes. Please go ahead.<br>M. Kahn – OK. My name…<br>MK – Please, if your Japanese, make a record of this and put it on the internet in Japan.<br>Section cut this and promote it across the world because it is gonna touch all of you, all. When we said today we were gonna release information:<br>This part, this is what we were talking about!<br>Learn what it is, the data which is going to be submitted and the information is gonna be submitted and then we’ll see where we go, and then we discuss afterwards. You can ask directly questions from a M. Kahn and then he’ll go with it. Please start, I’ll go silent.<br>M. Kahn – Thank your Sir. My name is …. (can’t understand) … and I’m Turkish by origin, but i’m grown up in Japan. And I have a degree in chemical engineer and …<br>MK – Hello M. Kahn!<br>M. Kahn – Yeah.<br>MK – You’re very, very faint, you have to speak louder and start from the beginning please, you’re very faint.<br>Mario Kienappel – Or maybe get closer to the microphone.<br>M. Kahn – Yeah, I’m trying to figure out, yeah.<br>MK －是的。请前进。<br>M. 卡恩－好。我的名字…<br>MK －请，如果你用日本语，在日本作下记录而且把它放在英特网。<br>因为它要关系到你所有，所以剪辑这些，推广到世界。我们今天说我们要释放信息：<br>这是一部份，我们正在谈论的！<br>学习它是什么，数据和信息要被接收，然后我们将会见到我们去的地方，然后我们然后讨论。你能直接地问一个 M. 卡恩的问题，然后他将会回答。请开始，我将变沈默。<br>M. 卡恩－谢谢你的爵士。我的名字是….（不能了解）…而且藉着起源，我是土耳其的，但是我在日本被长大。而且我在化学的工程师中有一个程度和…<br>MK －哈罗的 M. 卡恩！<br>M. 卡恩－是的。<br>MK －你是真正、非常微弱，你必须更高声地说而且从这开始开始请，你非常微弱。<br>马里奥 Kienappel －或也许拿比较靠近的到喇叭筒。<br>M. 卡恩－是的，我正在尝试理解，是的。<br>MK – OK, it sounds good when you are closer to the microphone or if you have a headphone. Have you got a headphone?<br>M. Kahn – Not a headphone but I think I’m pretty close, can you hear me now?<br>MK – Yeah. If you have a headphone you have an arrow next to your microphone, click it and choose your headphone and then you go to … It sounds like you’re coming through the microphone of the computer. Next to your microphone on the Zoom, there is a arrow, upward arrow, click on it and choose the microphone which you have attached to your system and then you speak through it.<br>M. Kahn – No I don’t have.<br>MK – You don’t have. OK carry on then, just stay close please.<br>M. Kahn – OK. Can you hear me better now?<br>MK – Yeah, it’s very good, please stay very close.<br>MK －好，当你接近喇叭筒时，它听很好，或者如果你有一个耳机。你已经得到一个耳机吗？<br>M. 卡恩－不是耳机而是我认为相似的东西，你现在听到我吗？<br>MK －是的。如果你有你有一支紧邻你的喇叭的健，按它而且选择你的耳机的一个耳机，然后你去到…它听起来像你计算机的喇叭筒。紧邻在ZOOM上的你的喇叭筒，有一支健、向上的健，在它上面点击并且选择你已经有的喇叭筒把它附到你的系统然后你说话。<br>M. 卡恩－没有我没有。<br>MK －你没有。好进位在那时，放在停留结束上请。<br>M. 卡恩－好。你现在能听到我好了吗？<br>MK －是的，它非常好，请保持非常接近。<br>M. Kahn – OK Sir. As I said my name is Kahn (not understand) and I’m a Turkish by origin but I grown up in Japan. I have a degree in chemical engineer and masters degree in  business administration. I have been working for a major Japanese trading company and one of my duties was supplying for chemicals regarding this cleanup.<br>MK – Your job was? Can you repeat what was your job?<br>M. Kahn – My job, one of my jobs was supplying stuff. Stuff means like all kinds of goods to be used by TEPCO. Before my company was a preferred partner for Tepco for supplying let’s say the cables, pipes and all sorts of stuff.<br>So in Japan there is a tradition that the companies they don’t buy directly, especially government companies they don’t buy from suppliers. They don’t seem to want to deal with it and there are trading companies in between, who supplies them.<br>So when it comes to TEPCO and we were one of the major supplier for TEPCO. We bring cables, we bring pipes, let’s say all sorts of stuff, including Ion-Exchange Resin.<br>And I was the responsible person who’s dealing between suppliers and TEPCO.<br>02:15:00<br>M. 卡恩－好。我的名字是卡恩 （不了解），而且我是土耳其裔，我在日本长大。我有在化学的工程师中的一个学位而且在商业管理有硕士学位。我一直为一家主要的日本贸易公司工作，而且我的责任之一正在为关于这一个清除的（核污染）化学药品供应。<br>MK －你的工作是？你能重复你的工作是什么吗？<br>M. 卡恩－我的工作，我的工作之一正在供应被 TEPCO 用的东西。象我们说的电缆、管和所有的东西，我之前的公司是 Tepco 的一个优先的合伙人。<br>因此在日本有贯例是公司他们没有直接地买，尤其政府公司的供应商的东西。他们似乎不想和它们交易，而是那些供应他们的贸易公司之间进行交易。<br>因此对 TEPCO ，而且我们是 TEPCO 的主要供应者之一时。我们带给它管，绳子，所有的东西，包括离子交换用的树脂，我们带来电缆。<br>而且我是这个供应者和 TEPCO 之间处理的责任人。<br>02:15:00<br>And one of the materials which were used to supply was the “Ion-Exchange Resin”, which is used to filter the water in Fukushima.<br>And they used to use a company’s product … I’m not going to give the name and the details …. because I already have a lot of problems in Japan because doing this.<br>And as Mr. Keshe said I’m already labeled for my job and it seems impossible for me to find a new job in Japan because of my name at the moment.<br>Yes, so I’m not going to give to much in detail unless you ask.<br>I used to supply a prominent company in US, it’s a known company in the nuclear Ion-Exchange Resin and other Resins, and it is pricy.<br>And it has problem with Calcium. The water in Fukushima is pretty much calcinated and it makes impossible for the regular Ion-Exchange Resin to be used.<br>So I was in ???Destroit??? for different material to supply TEPCO, which they asked.<br>And after my search o the internet I came across with Mr. Keshe’s GANS, CO2 and other types of GANS. Copper GANS and carbon dioxide GANS.<br>常于供应的材料之一是被用来在福岛过滤水的 “ 离子交换树脂 “。<br>而且他们过去一直使用一种公司产品…我没有要给名字和细节….因为做这个，我在日本已经有许多问题。<br>而且作为 Keshe 先生说我已经为我的工作被分类，而且它似乎不可能让我此刻因为我的名字在日本找一个新工作。<br>是的，因此我不能给更加详细地东西，除非你问。<br>我过去一直供应美国一家显著的公司，它是核子的离子交换树脂和其他树脂中的一家已知的公司，而且它是 昂贵的 。<br>而且它有钙的问题。在福岛的水是相当很多的锻烧产物 ，这让它为成为要用在离子交换树脂制造是不可能的。<br>因此我是在？？？Destroit？？？对于不同的材料供应 TEPCO，他们要求的。<br>而且在我的通过的英特网搜寻之后，我接触到 Keshe 先生是 GANS 、 CO2 和 GANS 的其他类型。铜 GANS 和二氧化碳 GANS。<br>So I wanted to give a chance! To give a try!<br>If that really works.<br>So that’s how I approached Mr. Keshe on more than almost 3 years ago in between 2013.<br>So I contact him, he was in Italy, in a different part of Italy and he was kind to accept me and we spoke and after that he gave me and he sent me some samples.<br>And those samples were … was given to TEPCO in order to test it.<br>The problem was: TEPCO wanted to keep themselves out of this move. Not to look like that they are using, because they are using Mr. Keshe’s technology and in a meeting after the test at a meeting I remember that the person who’s responsible for this clean-up, he said:<br>因此我想要提供一个机会！提供一个尝试！<br>如果它真的有效。<br>这是我为何在3 年多前几乎在 2013之前接近 Keshe 先生.<br>因此我连络他，他在意大利，在意大利的不同地区而且他很亲切的接受我，我们交谈后他给我还发给我一些样品。<br>那些样品是…给TEPCO 来测试它。<br>问题是：TEPCO 想要在这种运作中他们自己保留。不看起来像他们正在使用一样，因为他们正在使用 Keshe 先生的技术，还有我记得在测试之后的一个会议中有这个扫除的负责的人，他说：<br>“We don’t actually want to use Mr. Keshe. We don’t like to use Mr. Keshe’s technology. But we have to use it.”<br>So this was the mind-set, this was the approach. They don’t really want to deal with it, but they had to deal with it because they had no other choices.<br>Ok, so aahm … the samples were given to TEPCO and TEPCO did various tests and then they asked [for] more samples and Mr. Keshe sent more samples and I gave more samples.<br>Also at that time there was an issue with Strontium and Tritium mainly.<br>With the Tritium, Mr. Keshe also sent them another kind of a device for a setup in order to be used with this CO2 GANS.<br>And this was also supplied and this was also tested.<br>And then everything went well.<br>There is actually like various groups. In one group which they call it the “Cleaning-up the Water in the Tanks” and then so they can pump it back to sea, because simply there is no way to store them on the site or nearby.<br>Because every day, almost like … depending on the day, almost like 200 or 300 tons of water, … highly contaminated water is pumped in and pumped out from the reactors and cannot be pumped into sea and cannot be stored easily. It’s a lot of water. Every day.<br>02:20:00<br>”我们不实际上想要使用 Keshe 先生。我们不喜欢使用 Keshe 先生是技术。但是我们必须使用它。”<br>因此这是心态，这是方法。他们不真的想要处理它，但是因为他们没有了其他选择，他们必须处理它。<br>好，因此样品对 TEPCO 有，而且 TEPCO 做了各种不同的测试，然后他们又要更多的样品并 Keshe 先生又发送更多的样品，而且我给更多的样品。<br>那时，还主要有锶 和氚有意见。<br>由于氚， Keshe 先生也发了另一种装备来用在 CO2 GANS的安排上<br>而且这也被供应了，而且这也被测试了。<br>然后每件事物去的很好。<br>那里实际上有各种不同的小组。其中一个是他们叫做 “水箱内的净化 “ 的一个小组，他们把水抽回到海洋，只因为没有方法在附近的位置上储存。<br>因为每天，几乎一天大概有 200 或 300 吨水，…高度受污染的水从反应堆抽出和抽进而且而且不能够被灌入海洋而且不能够容易地被储存。它是许多水。每天。<br>02:20:00<br>So and … I think the tests all went well, as well as I was informed, but there was such a … strict procedures, including a big NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement).<br>Most of them, probably who’s  in the business, know what’s an NDA.<br>We cannot really, at that time, still we cannot really expose that we are giving the suppliers, because if it’s a strict rule that we cannot help our suppliers that we are applying to Fukushima.<br>It concerns Mr. Keshe, it concerns the other companies.<br>So, if it’s a Government procedure, if it’s a Government secrecy, if it’s a Government related job, so as a trading company we are buying, but we are not telling the buyer that we are supplying to TEPCO, we are giving to TEPCO.<br>If TEPCO has a problem with the parts or with the material, TEPCO … giving the claim to us, and we give claim to the supplier, without telling who is using it.<br>But this is not the trading company it is the other (..?) in Japan.<br>Umm yes, under strict NDA conditions, we were told that the, the tests all went well.<br>And there was two gentlemen who were supposed to visit Mr. Keshe in Italy, and it was all scheduled.<br>And then, at the last moment something happened.<br>因此和…我认为测试完美，连同我被告知了，虽然有如此严格的程序，包括大 NDA（非揭发协议）.<br>他们大部份，或许谁有在生意方面，知道什么是 NDA。<br>我们不能够真的，那时，因为它是一条我们不能够帮助我们的供应者适用于福岛的严格的规则，所以我们不能够真的暴露我们正在就职的供应者。<br>它与 Keshe 先生有关，它与其他公司有关。<br>因此，如果它是一个政府程序，如果它是一个政府秘密，如果它是政府相关的工作，如此当一家我们正在买的贸易公司，我们就不能告诉买主我们正在提供给 TEPCO ，我们正在给 TEPCO。<br>如果 TEPCO 有部份材料的问题， TEPCO …提出关于我们的要求，我们不能告诉谁正在使用它，我们给供应者提出要求。<br>但是这不是贸易公司，而是日本的其他 （..?) 者的。<br>Umm 是的，在严格的 NDA 条件下，我们被告诉的是测试完全地好。<br>而且在意大利有应该拜访 Keshe 先生的两个绅士，而且它全部被安排了。<br>然后，在最后时刻，某事发生了。<br>Page 051<br>So, and we got a big problem.  Somehow … ahm …. we were told that … umm ….<br>I myself told Mr. Keshe that I am supplying the stuff to TEPCO.<br>So it wasn’t supposed to be told to Mr. Keshe, officially, and then this was a problem.<br>Mr. Keshe:          You got to realize, let me give you a piece of information.<br>You’ve got to realize, when you have a man who comes from Japan, and we send directly shipment into Tokyo, and we are directly speaking about nuclear contamination, it can’t be any but TEPCO!<br>So, it was as we are so intelligent we understand the nuclear technology, it was obvious that Mr. Khan was a supply into TEPCO.<br>You don’t need to put two … It doesn’t take much of an intelligence to put two and two together!<br>And this is what TEPCO could not understand, they presumed that everybody’s stupid.<br>And that’s where the problem came!<br>It wasn’t that it was disclosed to us, but it was that we knew, because it was obvious:<br>There’s only one nuclear accident, one people who have a radiation problem.<br>And how come we are literally sending….  if you remember Mr. Khan, we were sending the CO2 as “Talcum Powder Solution” in one of the DHL,  the Americans allowed it to be shipped out, if you remember?<br>因此，和我们有了一个大问题。不知何故… ahm．．．．我们被告诉那了… umm．．．．<br>我自己告诉 Keshe 先生我正在提供东西给 TEPCO 。<br>它没想告诉 Keshe 先生，正式地，然后这是一个问题。<br>Keshe 先生：你开始了解，让我给你一个信息。<br>你必须了解，假如当你有一个来自日本的男人，直接地把它送装船进入东京之内，而且我们直接地谈论核子的污染，这是不可能的，但除了 TEPCO！<br>因此，我们是如此聪明，我们了解核子的技术，它很明显以至于可汗先生进入 TEPCO 之内作一个补给。<br>你不需要放二…它不用许多智力把二放一起和二！<br>而且这是什么 TEPCO 无法了解，他们假定那每个人愚蠢的。<br>而且那是问题被提出的地方！<br>因为它很明显，所以它不是它对我们被揭露，而是我们知道它：<br>只有一个核子的意外事件，只有一个人们，他们有一个放射线问题的。<br>而且我们怎么会正在照字面上地送….如果你记得可汗先生，我们正在送的 CO2是作为 DHL 之一的 “ 爽身粉溶液 “ ，美国人允许了它被运送出，如果你记得？<br>Mr. Khan:            Yes!  Exactly!<br>Mr. Keshe:          Because the Americans were controlling in what we were sending out.  A lot of it went through Los Angeles out to Tokyo, if I am correct?<br>Mr. Khan:            Yes, Sir!<br>Mr. Keshe:          And in couple of instances, especially when we came to Strontium, we shipped directly into Japan for TEPCO.<br>We have all the DHL papers.<br>We have all the Federal Express papers, what we have shipped, where we have shipped.<br>So carry on, please.<br>Mr. Khan: Yes, Sir!  There was various issues with the shipment, but somehow it worked, and the samples arrived to Japan, and was delivered to TEPCO.<br>And yes, the last moment, something from the upper level, from the TEPCO of my company had a big claim that we were on the breach of NDA, which means we broke the NDA regulatory rules, and we had a big problem, all sorts of stuff.<br>And then they cancelled their trip to Mr. Keshe.   And then, in three weeks, there we had meeting with my boss, also my bosses’ boss!<br>I mean he’s the owner of the company and this person has almost like 7,000 workers in Japan<br>And he has 60 companies extra, he is such a high level person.<br>可汗先生：是的！完全是地！<br>Keshe 先生：因为美国人正在控制我们送出的。许多它在外经过洛杉矶才到东京，如果我是正确的？<br>可汗先生：是的，爵士！<br>Keshe 先生：而且在例证的配对中，尤其当我们到达 Strontium（锶） ，我们直接地为 TEPCO 进入日本之内运送。<br>我们有所有的 DHL 文件。<br>我们有所有的联邦明确的文件，我们运送的什么，我们在哪运送。<br>请继续。<br>可汗先生：是的，爵士！用装船有各种不同的议题，但是不知何故它运作了，而且样品对日本到达了，而且被递送到 TEPCO 了。<br>而且是的，最后时刻，某事从上面的水平，从我的公司的 TEPCO 有了一个大要求「我们在 NDA 的违反上」，意谓我们违反了 NDA 管制的规则，而且我们有了一个大问题，所有的东西。<br>然后他们取消了他们的去 Keshe 先生的旅程。然后，在三个星期内，在那里，我们和我的老板举行了会议，还有我的 老板的老板！<br>我意指他是像几乎有的 7,000个工人的日本公司的拥有者的这一个人<br>而且他额外有 60个 公司，他是如此的一个高级的人。<br>He had a meeting with TEPCO, and the outcome of the meeting that yes, my company, which he owns, is one of the 60 companies he owns, we broke the rules. And it was obvious that we did, and somebody has to pay for it.<br>And then I was the black sheep at that time who has to pay for it.<br>02:25:00<br>And I had to resign.<br>And then after two months my boss had to resign as well.<br>He was 65 at that time, he was close to retirement. He didn’t mind resigning that much also. But it wasn’t a good thing anyway. His life is ok.<br>Although my live had crippled like this at my young age.<br>So the problem is after everything happened and I sat down and recalled what has happened, it looks like … I remember what the guy said, the director at that time: “We don’t want to deal with Mr. Keshe. But we have to deal with Mr. Keshe”.<br>So, it looks like his technology is pretty much open. Very much open. They used to even making GANS in a simple matter.<br>But they don’t really need Mr. Keshe any more. They don’T even needed me.<br>So as a Japanese, especially dealing with a person who is in critic??? of United States which the US government which i’m going to show you now is very much involved with the cleaning up of Fukushima, so they know about dealing with an Iranian person with a critic of US and providing the biggest solution, most wanted solution for Fukushima which nobody proved up to that point.</p>
<p>他有了和 TEPCO 的会谈，会议的结果是，我的公司，他拥有的，是他拥有的这 60家公司之一，我们违反了规则。而且很明显的是我们做了，而且某人必须支付它。<br>然后我那时是败家子了并且必须支付它。<br>02:25:00<br>而且我必须辞职。<br>而且在两个月之后当时，我的老板必须也辞职。<br>他那时是 65 ，他接近退休。他没有那么多介意辞职。但是它无论如何不是一件好事物。他的生活是 ok 。<br>虽然我的生活的像这样受创了在我的年轻年龄。<br>因此每件事物之后问题发生了，而且我坐了下来而且回想什么已经发生，它看起来像…我记得人说的，那时的主任说：”我们不想要处理 Keshe 先生。但是我们必须处理 Keshe 先生”.<br>因此，它看起来像他的技术一样非常开着。非常开放。他们过去一直使用简单的物质去制造 GANS 。<br>但是他们真的不再需要 Keshe 先生。他们甚至不需要我。<br>因此当做一个日本人，尤其这人与一个批评家？？？我展示给你美国政府和福岛的清洁工作有多大的关系，（不会翻译）他们知道一位美国的批评家处理一个提供最大的解决的伊朗人，想要大部分解决福岛的人，没有人能证明到达了哪一个点。<br>So they wanted to cut him off.<br>And they find some gap that they brought the NDA and this was the reason and then I got scribed out from the company and all. And they are all clean and I am the one who is in fault although the kind of stolen information from us they used for themselves.<br>That was the situation.<br>And then now, these are all passed and gone. So they didn’t promote Mr. Keshe as the let’s say the person who really helped the Fukushima cleanup and right now the Fukushima clean-up is more or less … I’m gonna show you now they can pump the water into the sea, starting from 2015 and it looks like they had no issue with the water.<br>Mr. Keshe actually is the person and his technology is the technology is been used by TEPCO at this point but he is not accredited for this.<br>Due to I think like high level political issues.<br>So let me … Can you all see my screen?<br>Mr. Keshe: Yes, we see the “Clean up Fukushima &amp; Keshe”<br>Page 053<br>因此他们想要切去他。<br>而且他们找到一些漏洞，他们拿来了 NDA ，然后这就是我被从公司和一切划出的理由。而且他们完全没责任，过失只在我一个，虽然类似他们偷了我们的数据类型并为他们自己用。<br>就是那种情形。<br>现在，这些完全地过去了。因此他们没有继续把 Keshe 先生当做真的帮助福岛清除的人或者或多或少帮助过清除…我要给你看现在他们放入海洋的水，从 2015开始就看起来像他们用的水一样没有问题。<br>Keshe 先生实际上是人，而且他的技术是技术并在那时被 TEPCO 用，但是他并不被认可。<br>我想这是由于类似于的高水准的政治问题。<br>让我…你全部能见到我的荧屏吗？<br>Keshe 先生：是的，我们见到这 “ 整理福岛＆Keshe”</p>
<p>Mr. Kahn:<br>This is the beginning, the cover of the presentation I made a simple one.<br>This was this happened 2012 a big wave hit to the reactor there and the reactor exploded and there are  pretty much more pictures on the internet so that everybody knows.<br>And this was the situation in 2011.<br>卡恩先生：这是开始，我制做发表的简单的报告 。这是这发生 2012 的一个大地震中反应堆在那里并且在爆炸，而且英特网上有更多照片方便每个人都知道。这在 2011 年是情形了.</p>
<p>They had 4 reactors there. This is #1, #2, #3 and #4.<br>The 4th reactor it didn’t contain any reactance??? …. but it was for the excess … the excess fuel from the reactor number #1, #2 and #3.<br>This is the seaside and this is how today’s ??? sea from the reactors<br>And at that time after this big wave this is what the situation is.<br>So reactor #1 it says “Uranium is partially melted”.<br>And those are the water storage tanks.<br>他们在那里有 4个反应堆。这是＃1, #2, #3 和＃4.<br>第 4个反应堆没有包含任何电抗？？？….但是它是过量给的…过量的燃料来自反应堆＃1 , #2 和＃3.<br>这是海岸也是如何今天？？？反应堆的海洋<br>那时 在这个大震之后情形。<br>因此反应堆＃1 椐说 “ 铀部份地被融化 “.<br>那些是水储藏箱。</p>
<p>Both tanks are used to get the water from the sea supplied to the reactor, they clean up the water and they cool down the reactor and they have a … this is a facility which cleans up the waters that little contaminated water under conventional means … which is not highly contaminated and pump it back to the sea.<br>It’s pretty much common to …<br>02:30:00<br>??? to do in the nuclear reactors they cool down the nuclear reactors with the sea water and pump it back.<br>And this is the 2nd reactor that has the Spent fuel inside but this was not the main issue.<br>The main issue was the 3rd reactor and it was fully, not partially like #1, it was fully destroyed and there was a melt-down and all of around this area, especially here, #3 and #4 was not accessible to human by any means in order to go inside and figure out what had happened.<br>This is the situation 2015:<br>两个水箱是用来从海洋取水供给反应堆的，他们洁净处理水并用来冷却反应堆，而且他们有一…这是整理习惯上称为轻度污染的水的设备…一个不是高度被污染而且把它排放到海洋的水。<br>它常常 ……<br>02:30:00<br>？？？用海洋水在核子反应堆中冷却并排放到海中。<br>这是第二个反应堆内有废燃料，内部没有主要的问题。<br>主要的议题是第三个反应堆，而且它完全地，不部份地象＃1, 它完全被破坏，而且是回炉的而且周围是海水环绕，尤其在这里， #3 和＃4是人类无法接近的，并且意味着进入知道会发生什么事。<br>这是2015的情形:</p>
<p>And this is the reactor #1, #2, #3 and this is the reactor #4 that they used to store the excess radioactive material.<br>This is where they get into from here, there are pipelines going under this building. And from this building, this is connected to the reactor, cooling down the water. And the water comes back into this building and there are various filters and then it’s filtered to the radioactive contamination with contact, it is used to be like that.<br>Right now it was in a really bad condition as you can see and this is published from our science newspaper in Japan.<br>Normally you can not get there shot like these details from the side because it is so prohibited.<br>So it looks like it’s pretty much again recovered and you can see all the cars are parked and human people are walking which is actually impossible under conventional ???.<br>You can see the … you can think about the Tschernobyl/Chernobyl in Russia and it was still not possible even to come near by to that nuclear site after the explosion.<br>And here it was highly contaminated four years ago as you can see.<br>这是反应堆＃1, #2, #3 和这是他们过去一直储存过量的放射性的材料的反应堆的＃4。</p>
<p>这是他们进入的地方，有渠道在这一楝建筑物之下。而且从这一楝建筑物，连接到反应堆，冷却下来的水。而且水回来进这建筑物，而且有各种不同的过滤器，然后它们连络一起过滤到放射性的污染水，它被用来像那。<br>立刻，当你能见到，它在一种非常差劲情况中，而且这在日本被刊登在我们的科学报纸。<br>通常你不能到那里从边目击这些细节因为它被禁止。<br>因此它看起来相当像它再次被恢复和你能见到所有的汽车被停放和人类在步行，这在以往是不可能的？？？。<br>你能见到这…你能在俄国想 Tschernobyl│车诺堡，它甚至仍然是不可能的来接近到那个核子的位置。<br>在这里，你见到的，是四年前高度地污染的。。<br>Those are the sites “Debris” fuel it means that the fuel is all like all around the site, not inside the reactor only.<br>And now you can see and there are also you can find various pictures on the internet … people are walking!<br>And there is a kind of a joke and some people even wanted to make some kind of a guided tour for tourists.<br>They call it “Black Tourism” in order to … for the regular people to resist the Fukushima site.<br>For it isn’t that much safe at the moment.<br>But what kind of technology do they have and they can clean up that nuclear site which was heavily polluted in less than four years?<br>And until 2013/2014 they couldn’t do anything.<br>Until 2013/2014 nothing could be done.<br>Even the robots, they went into the nuclear site, got tried out with the radiation and even the robots couldn’t work. Not even the human.<br>And then after 2005/2006/2014 something has happened.<br>Something has happened and …<br>那些是意谓的” 碎片 “ 燃料像在周围四处，不只有在反应者内。<br>而且现在你能见到而且也能在英特网上找到各种不同的照片…人们正在步行！<br>而且有一种一个笑话，而且一些人甚至想要给旅游者做导游。<br>他们称它为 “ 黑色观光事业 “ 到…让一般的人到合适的福岛位置。<br>因为它此刻不是那么安全的。<br>但是他们有那一类的技术，而他们能少于四年内整理有很重地污染的那个核子的位置？<br>而且直到 2013|2014 他们无法做任何事。<br>直到 2013|2014 什么也没做。<br>甚至他们进入核子的位置，机械手在放射线中在外试验过了机械手是无法工作的。更不用说人类。<br>而且在2005|2006|2014 之后当时某事已经发生的。<br>某事已经发生和…<br>Mr. Keshe: You mean 2013/2014 ?<br>Mr. Kahn:<br>2013 actually the person who I was dealing with, the head of the director died from the cancer.<br>And then things have changed and 2014 … Yes I start supplying Your material.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Can you repeat that, please?<br>Kahn:<br>Ok, 2013 the director of Fukushima clean-up has died from cancer.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Of too much radiation?<br>Mr. Kahn:<br>Yes, but they don’t say. They say, he was a heavy smoker and that’s why he died out of cancer.<br>This is what the official explanation is.<br>So you can find information all over the world regarding him. So yes: He died.<br>Keshe 先生：你意指 2013|2014?<br>卡恩先生：2013 实际上我同事的人，指主任的头得癌死了。<br>然后事情已经改变和 2014 …是的我开始供应你的材料。<br>Keshe 先生：你能重复那吗？谢谢！<br>卡恩先生：好， 2013年担任福岛扫除的主任已经从癌死了。<br>Keshe 先生：太多放射线？<br>卡恩先生：是的，但是他们不说。他们说，他是一个重吸烟者，而且那是他为什么死于癌。<br>这是官方的解释。因此你能在全世界找到关于他信息。所以是的：他死了。</p>
<p>第五部分笔译　　 micropoint<br>02:35:00<br>And after he died, … he was a very ???securely??? Guy, …he was a …<br>He belonged to a tradition where the “old” Japanese belong to … and he didn’t really try anything out[side] of the Japan.<br>So they were trying to do it within the Japan, within the Japanese technology. Not too much getting help from the outside. So they wanted to keep it very secret what they are doing.<br>The situation was    r e a l l y    b a d !<br>The situation is really bad, Tokyo is almost like 250km far and especially reactor #4 is full of nuclear rods and it can explode!<br>且在他死后…他是一个很谨慎的人？?？他是…<br>他属于很传统的那种老一代日本人…且不会真的去试日本以外的东东。<br>所以他们正在日本国内尝试使用日本人的技术解决问题，并不对外寻求帮助。<br>所以他们对他们做的一直保密<br>情况真的很坏，东京基本有250公里远且4号反应器充满核废料还可能爆炸。</p>
<p>So, if that exploded, … actually didn’t happen, … not even Tokyo, the north of Japan including Tokyo all the way to Osaka would be contaminated!</p>
<p>And nobody could even like get in.<br>所以如果它爆炸，实际不会发生，不止东京还有日本北部直到东京以及长崎都会被污染，且没有人会希望这样。<br>Such a big situation!<br>And even that was not told to the public!<br>People in Tokyo, 250km away were living their regular life without knowing that reactor #4 can explode anytime and they can even die right away.<br>So it was such a bad condition, but the government including the guy who passed out has keeping it very secret.<br>这样一个重要的情况，甚至不向公众说明。<br>住在东京250公里范围的人都还在过着正常生活，而不知道4号反应器随时会爆炸导致他们随时会死掉。<br>这是一个很坏的情况，但是政府包括那个传出信息的人都在保守秘密。<br>And they didn’t want to deal with anybody and anything out of this island and everything is kept secret. After the guy passed out things have changed.<br>A new person came and it was obvious that none of the solutions that Japanese or a Japanese Company or a Japanese Institution can provide works.<br>So at that time they tried different alternatives including Mr. Keshe’s Technology.<br>So and 2015 you can see: People are walking, the cars are beside the nuclear reactor and this is the situation.<br>他们不想找任何日本以外的人来处理这个事情，且一直在保密。在那个人传出去后事情变了。<br>一个新的人来了且没有一个日本人或公司或学校能提供解决方案。<br>所以那时他们试了各种方法也包括keshe的技术。<br>所以到2015年你可以看到 人们开始走动，汽车开始停在反应堆附近了。就是这个情况。<br>What and how this happened?<br>This is the simple thing: How did this happen? In less than 3 years?<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Was this the process when they were given the CO2? The production of the GANS?<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Ja, the production of the GANS can be done pretty much on their own.<br>Mr. Keshe:    But they were shown, it’s effective?<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Yes!<br>As far as I know and I am the one of the major company who’s supplying the …<br>Mr. Keshe:    The original samples? … The original samples of the GANS from us?<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Yes. The thing is … they got the samples, … they tried it out, … they saw that it works, … and then they cut us off.<br>So because it was big thing and …<br>Mr. Keshe:    Because we are teaching it on the internet, so they knew what to do?<br>(scrambled because both speak ????) … getting it to work.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Yes. They just wanted to have a real product. Not because …<br>发生了什么?怎么发生的？<br>这是简单的事情 怎么在3年内做到的？<br>凯史先生:<br>是给他们co2的过程吗？是甘斯产品吗？<br>甘斯产品比他们有的做的效果更好<br>但是他们展示了这是有效的 对吧？<br>是的<br>至今我知道的我们是提供样品的主要公司之一<br>原始样品？来自我们的原始甘斯样品？<br>是的。事情是这样的。他们拿到样品就进行实验，发现有效然后就把我们赶走了。<br>所以因为这是大事件。<br>因为我们在网上教学，所以他们知道做什么让它生效。<br>是的。所以他们就是要真实的产品。不因为别的<br>In order to … you want to try out a new technology, right?<br>And you want to get this sample from the inventor himself.<br>So you want a real sample …<br>Mr. Keshe:    Do you have a picture of You in Fukushima?<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Ja, I sent it to you, I guess.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Can you send it … Can you put it on?<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>I don’t have it on this computer.<br>Mr. Keshe:    You don’t have it on that computer. … I don’t have access to my computer. …<br>We’ll release the pictures of Mr. ??? at the Fukushima … at the gates of Fukushima when he was delivering the material to the site.<br>And there are videos of us life:<br>Testing Things with the Fukushima Officials. Just a week before they flying to Italy, before they were stopped to do so.<br>Carry on, please.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>When this happens, … they got the samples, … they tried them out, … and they had a problem with the Tritium and they couldn’t figure that out, how that works.<br>And Mr. Keshe provided some kind of simple solution to the TEPCO to be used with the GANS and then they tried it, too … and that worked as well!<br>And then, from the … for the people who did the test [it] was ok, they had no problem with dealing with Mr. Keshe on their side.<br>But the thing is: The upper ??? was probably who stopped this.<br>And this is what they said from TEPCO.<br>为了…你想试一下新技术。对吧？<br>且你想从发明者那里拿到样品，所以你想拿到一个真实的…<br>有你在福岛的照片吗？<br>嗯 我发给你<br>你现在能发它吗？<br>这个计算机没这个照片<br>你在那个计算机上没有照片…我没有访问我的电脑。<br>我们将发布..先生在福岛的照片。是他去送样品到福岛核电站时在门口的照片。<br>还有一些现场视频。包括福岛官方测试的视频，这是在他们飞往意大利之前一星期的事情。也是在他们被禁止提供样品以后。<br>请继续<br>当事情发生时…他们拿到样品就开始测试，他们对于氚有一个问题且不能理解是如何产生作用的。然后凯史先生提供了某种简单的方案给TEPCO,方案使用了甘斯且测试效果很好。<br>然后从这里…对于人进行测试也是好的，他们那边对于凯史的技术已经没有问题了。<br>但是事情是：上层阻止了继续这个事情。<br>且这就是他们从TEPCO传出的信息。<br>02:40:00<br>And they cut Mr. Keshe off and stopped coming to Italy and they cut my company and then they gave another reason that would be the NDA breach.<br>And then they cut me off and my boss also, so … Uhfffff …<br>The thing is: They producing the GANS itself, I think they’re using it widely in order to clean-up Fukushima.<br>并且他们阻止了凯史先生，且组织到意大利了。他们阻止了我的公司，然后他们给了另一个原因就是违反了保密协议。<br>他们也阻止了我和我的老板。<br>事情就是：他们自己生产了甘斯，我认为他们为了净化福岛核电站正在广泛使用它。<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>So, the GANS liquid is used for decontamination across Fukushima.<br>Dr. Kahn:    Yes!<br>The GANS is used in Fukushima and i’m going right now to show you how it is been used.<br>I made a small chart that shows what’s going on in Fukushima.<br>凯史先生：<br>所以，甘斯液体被用于净化福岛核污染。<br>是的！<br>甘斯被用在福岛核电站，我将马上展示甘斯是如何被使用的。我做了一个小图表显示在福岛核电站发生了什么。</p>
<p>With this side from the contaminated water you can find the major contaminants like Iodine, Tellurium, Caesium, Strontium and Plutonium, you know.<br>从下面图来看污染的水中你能发现主要的污染物像碘、碲、铯、锶和钚。</p>
<p>碘-131：相对容易清除<br>碲-129：困难<br>铯-137：困难<br>锶-90：非常困难<br>钚同位素：各种情况<br>And Iodine is pretty much easy, the technology has been there almost like 60 years; clean-up of Iodine from the contaminated water.<br>But Tellurium is pretty much difficult …<br>Caesium is difficult.<br>Strontium-90 is almost impossible, it’s highly difficult this is what … which is TEPCO was really got stagnant with.<br>And the level of Tritium which I didn’t write in here because the Tritium it doesn’t have a half-live that long, it can be stored and after let’s say 5 years all the radiation is almost gone and you can pump it into the sea.<br>且碘是相对比较容易处理的，这种技术已经有60年了。<br>但是碲是相当难以清理的。<br>铯也很难清理。<br>锶90几乎不可能去除，它是非常困难的。这就是TEPCO真的无法处理的。<br>而氚的污染程度我这里没写，因为氚并没有很长的半衰期，它能够被储存且在5年后所有的放射性几乎就没有了，然后就可以排放到海里了。<br>But the problem is: How can you store let’s say the minimum 200 tons daily of highly contaminated water on the site for 5 years?<br>It makes no sense. It needs a huge amount of setup which is impossible. There is no place to set up to store that much of water.<br>但是问题是：怎么可能储存每天至少200吨高度污染的水保持5年？<br>这样是说不通的。这需要一个巨大的存储量，目前是不可能的，没有那么大的地方放那么多水。</p>
<p>So, ok, since 2011 that side is producing 200-300 tons of highly contaminated water from the reactors mostly #3 and #1 daily.<br>And then 2015 TEPCO started releasing 850 tons of low-level radioactive water into the ocean daily.<br>And under conventional technology … normally you can filter a few hundred liters of highly contaminated water, not even tons!<br>This is pretty much expensive and hard.<br>So and then the question is, it says: Does TEPCO unlawfully without telling the international community release the highly contaminated water into the ocean?<br>Which is not be possible because if you release a highly contaminated water into the pacific from Japan, you can measure it in US or on the other side of the ocean you can measure it so much easily that highly contaminated water is being done.<br>So they cannot do that!<br>So, they have some kind of efficient technology in TEPCO which is not being released. If it’s being released, you could see on the internet that some scientists would publish papers at least.<br>Or getting the claim on it.<br>继续，自从2011年每天从3号和1号反应器中200-300吨高度污染的水被产生并被储存。<br>然后2015年TEPCO开始每天排放850吨低水平辐射性的水到海里。<br>但是当前传统技术正常只能过滤几百升高度污染的水，甚至不能到吨的级别！<br>这是非常昂贵和困难的。<br>那么问题是：是TEPCO在非法排放高度污染的水到海里而不告诉国际社会？<br>(传统方法是放射性材料使用离子交换媒介被从高度污染的水中恢复出来。)<br>这是不可能的，因为如果你从日本排放了高度污染的水进入太平洋的话，在美国或者海的对面都是可以测出这种高度污染的水的。<br>所以他们不会这么做！<br>所以他们在TEPCO有某种有效的净化技术而没有公开。如果是公开的，那么会有科学家发表的论文在网上被查到的或者进行声明。<br>Mr. Keshe:We have already published the papers. They know, what it is. This is the strange thing about it. There already … already released the knowledge.<br>Mr. Kahn:Yes. So, they have something that they are using but it is not clear that … they don’t admitted [what] they are using.<br>But that wasn’t there before we sent them the solution for Strontium?<br>Because immediately within a month they announced they have cleaned-up all the Strontium.<br>Mr. Kahn:<br>Yes. Strontium was a big issue and they had no solution for Strontium.<br>And after you sent them the samples, all the sudden they have a magic solution for the Strontium and then they start releasing water into the ocean.<br>So this is a strange thing.<br>凯史先生:<br>我们已经发表了论文，他们知道是什么。这是奇怪的事情，已经有公开的技术了。<br>Mr. Kahn:<br>是的，所以他们在使用某种东西但是目前还不确定，他们不承认他们在使用。<br>凯史先生<br>但是在我们发给他们碲的解决方案之前那是不存在的？<br>因为在之后的一个月内他们就宣布他们已经清除了所有的碲。<br>Mr. Kahn:<br>是的。碲的清除是个大问题，且他们没有什么方法。<br>但是在你发给他们样品之后，突然他们就有一个碲的清除的魔法般的解决方案了，然后他们就开始排放水到海里了。所以这是一个奇怪的事情。<br>02:45:00</p>
<p>Anyway, this is how the Ion-Exchanging works.<br>“Ion-Exchange Resin” means: It’s kind of a filter.<br>不管怎样，这是离子交换如何运行的。<br>“离子交换树脂”意思是：这是一种过滤材料。</p>
<p>传统的放射性材料如何使用离子交换中介从被污染的水中恢复。<br>These are two or three steps of filtering which is the … some sorts of filter material are being used.<br>It is similar to what most of the people are using at their home.<br>It is like … it consists of some let’s say clay or other ion-exchange resin all in like layers. They filter the water.<br>And highly contaminated radioactive particles are charged into the ion-exchange resin and then the water is cleaned. It’s pretty much the logic is simple but the exchanges and the filters they use itself which can absorb the radioactive material on themselves is a pretty much difficult technology.<br>Ok, so this is what is comes in.<br>And there is a company called “Kurion”:<br>And “Kurion” is an American Company.<br>And “Kurion” was such a small company, a start-up company<br>过滤过程有两步或者三步，其间某种过滤材料被使用。<br>这和大多数人在家里使用的方法很类似。<br>这就像…它由一些粘土或者离子交换树脂分层组成的，它们对水进行过滤。<br>高度污染的放射性粒子被冲进离子交换树脂，而水就干净了。这和传统的方法比起来逻辑简单的多，但是他们用来交换和过滤的材料却是相当困难的技术，因为材料可以吸收放射性物质。<br>好的，这就是发生的事情。<br>且有家公司叫“Kurion”<br>“Kurion”是一家美国公司。<br>“Kurion”是一个很小的公司，一个初创公司。</p>
<p>上面是“Kurion”公司的网页，介绍主要是清理核废料的公司。<br>Located in … I visited them a few times, … they had a location, they still have a location in ???, Los Angeles. They had an actual testing center in Seattle in America.<br>I have a business card of all the people I talked to, I can show you and …. yes.<br>This was such a small company!<br>And all the sudden … all the sudden this small company will became the key supplier for the<br>… became the key company who was chosen by the Japanese government in order to clean-up Fukushima. For the water, the highly contaminated water.<br>This is such a small company.<br>Why this company is granted from the Japanese government?<br>It is very unlikely!<br>First of all: It’s a US company. And it’s a small company! A start-up company.<br>And they have no technology, no … nothing in their hand which they can promote themselves as the major cleaning-up company of Fukushima, which is almost seems to be difficult.<br>Why ???[scrambled] Mitsubishi or Toshiba or other companies ???[scrambled] not granted?<br>这家公司我去过几次，他们在洛杉矶有个办公室，实际上在西雅图有个测试中心。<br>我有一张名片，所有我拜访过的人我可以给你展示一下。是的<br>这是一家很小的公司。<br>很突然的，这家小公司就变成关键供应商…变成关键公司被日本政府选中来清除福岛的高度污染的水。<br>这是一家很小的公司。<br>为什么这家公司被日本政府授权？<br>这是非常不可思议的事情。<br>首先：这是一家美国公司。且它是一家很小的公司，一家初创公司。<br>另外他们也没有技术，他们手里没有技术能够促使他们成为福岛核辐射的主要清理公司，这看上去基本是很困难的。<br>为什么？？？不是三菱或者东芝或者其他公司被授权？？？<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Let me explain to you … Let me explain something for those who don’t know:<br>“Fukushima Plant” was sold by the American Companies to Mitsubishi and Toshiba.<br>That they have nothing to do with … TEP … with what you call “Fukushima Plant”.<br>And in exchange … part of the contract is that this company was set up as a back-door to be able to catch/cash flow the money [that] was [earned] from the Keshefoundation Technology.<br>You got to understand that according to the 2nd World War Agreement:<br>Japanese can not do anything nuclear! They can not even buy a gram of Uranium without having the American government having a say in it.<br>So, the plant was owned officially by “Westinghouse” and the others, sold to get rid of … but to still have to have a line of earning for the American government.<br>So this company was set up.<br>Which means:<br>They have a stranglehold on the Japanese Nation totally in the nuclear industry.<br>And without this company signing the certification of clean-up IAEA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency</a> ) would not allow the reactors to come into operation.<br>In a way, this company is a back-door to … fraud.<br>凯史先生：<br>让我给你解释一下…让我向那些不了解的人解释一下：<br>福岛核电站被美国公司卖给了三菱和东芝。<br>他们和TEP没有关系…和你们称为福岛核电站的公司没有关系。<br>作为交换…合同的一部分就是成立这家公司作为洗钱的后门，这些钱主要是用凯史基金会的技术赚来的。<br>你要理解这是根据第二次世界大战的条约确定的。<br>日本人不能做任何核相关的事情！没有美国政府同意他们甚至不能买一克铀。<br>所以，这个核电站官方是属于美国西屋公司的，虽然被卖给其他公司，但是仍然必须为美国政府赚取利益。？<br>所以这家公司成立了。<br>这就意味着：<br>对于日本政府在核工业方面他们有一个把柄抓着。<br>没有这家公司签署的国际原子能机构清除技术的证书将不会允许反应器进行工作。<br>从某方面说，这家公司就是一个后门公司…就是诈骗公司。<br>High-Level Fraud, International Fraud in a way that the Americans keep control of the Japan nuclear industry, energy industry.<br>And in that process they get payed for it.<br>02:50:00<br>So now that the technology was delivered to Japan, and Westinghouse has handed over everything to the Japanese which is a “normal” transaction, then this company had to be set up. To be able to guarantee income into the United States from the investment of technology and control.<br>This is part of the same with Germany. German government, according to the 2nd World War, can not handle nuclear materials, in case they use it in different ways. So, what they do, they go outside invest in their name in nuclear industry – but under the cover of the German government.<br>We′ve seen this with the, …what You call it, with the new medical reactor in Belgium  in the nuclear area. So these kind of technologies are the backfeeders of the new technologies to control the contamination.<br>But in fact it′s an income, to guarantee the control, that it can not be out of the hand of<br>What I call United Nation.<br>Carry on please!<br>是高级诈骗公司，从某方面说就是美国政府用于控制日本核工业或者能源工业的一个国际骗子公司。<br>而在这个过程中他们可以获得利益。<br>02:50:00<br>所以现在核技术已经交给日本了，西屋公司已经移交所有技术给日本政府了，这是一个“正常”的交易，但是必须成立这家公司以保证相关技术的投资和控制能够受美国控制。<br>这也是德国处理核的方式。德国政府根据二战协议也不能处理核材料，假如他们要用不同方式处理核材料，他们就去外面其他国家投资核工业，但是在德国政府的控制下。<br>我们已经看到这些…就和你所称的那样，在比利时新的医疗反应器已经在核领域方面有类似技术。所以这种技术就是新的控制核污染的技术的反馈。？<br>但是实际上这是一种机制来确保它不能脱离联合国的控制。<br>请继续！</p>
<p>图译：Kurion的废水清洗系统<br>这个神奇的系统就能清除福岛核电站的成百上千吨的高度污染的水吗？<br>Mr. Khan<br>This is an old photo, You can pretty much find out more in the internet, so nothing secret, this is the Kurion’s mobile processing Unit. Which they have all the ion-exchange resin inside.<br>Water is put in, pumped out and the water is clean.  (???sound problems)<br>This is unlikely for a very small company, this kind of technology. Very, very unlikely to have …<br>Mr. Khan<br>这是一个旧照片，你能在网上发现更多照片，所以没什么稀奇，这是Kurion的移动处理单元，那里有他们所有的离子交换油脂。<br>水被引入再排出就是干净的水了。<br>这对于一家很小的公司是不可能的，这种技术是不可能的，非常不可思议的。<br>Under normal conditions You can - may be - maybe clean up a few hundred liters of water with a system as big as … I’m going to show You here  … as big as this building. It fits into this building.<br>在正常条件下，像下面图中那么大的建筑可能可以清除几百升水，我将向你展示一下，就是图上的建筑那么大。<br>02:52:20<br>M.T. Keshe<br>So this little thing is cleaning up the whole thing in Fukushima in a way?<br>所以下面图中这个小装置就是清除福岛核污染的所有装置了？</p>
<p>Mr. Khan<br>Yes. And this thing is a small container and is cleaning up everything in Fukushima.<br>Where did this technology came from all of a sudden?<br>And this is another picture, here….<br>是的，这个装置是个小容器，可以清除福岛所有的污染，怎么突然这种技术就出现了？来自于哪里呢？<br>下面是另一张照片，这里…</p>
<p>图译：Kurion的离子交换油脂材料被用在他们放射性材料恢复系统上<br>Mr. Keshe:    Who took this pictures?<br>凯史先生：这是谁拍的照片？<br>Mr. Khan:    Those pictures are taken by Kurion.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Aha, ok.<br>Let me ask: Please, webmasters and recorders, please record everything that if there is any attack on us to bring the website and teachings down – so we can go on the internet in different ways.<br>Mr. Khan:    那些照片是Kurion拍的<br>凯史先生：好的<br>让我看一下：请网站管理员和记录员注意，如果有任何针对我们的攻击导致网站和教学停止的话请记录下所有信息，所以我们在网上可以用不同方式继续的。<br>Mr. Khan<br>Yes so, this is the system when it is working. Those are the ion-exchange resin materials they use and for various…this is already set up in the piping system. Those pipes are filtered with these materials and the water runs through the pipe and gets cleaned.<br>And, as You can see, this white material is ……very very …. familiar to you I guess.<br>Mr. Keshe:    This is CO2?<br>Mr. Khan:    Yes!<br>02:53:46<br>Mr. Keshe:    This is the Gans of CO2 .<br>Mr. Khan:    This is the last step. Actually the actual step which cleans up the water.<br>The only after these One, two, three, four and five is being used for the purification of water<br>Khan先生<br>是的，这就是运行的系统。那些是他们使用的离子交换油脂材料且用于不同的放射性材料…这些已经被用于管道系统了。那些管道被用这些材料过滤，而水通过这些管道出来就干净了。<br>我猜，你能看到这些白的材料对你来说非常熟悉。上图箭头所指<br>凯史先生：这是CO2？<br>Mr. Khan: 是的！<br>02:53:46<br>凯史先生：这是CO2甘斯。<br>Mr. Khan: 这是最后一步。实际上也是清除污染的水实际生效的步骤。<br>也是在前面这些1、2、3、4、5材料被用于水的提纯之后唯一的步骤。<br>….just the water ,<br>….than, because in the water there is also not only radioactive materials and the heavy other contaminants, like the heavy metals let’s say arsenic or  the other isotopes, which can not be actually used by … cleaned up – by the CO2 Gans.<br>They really … they had to have some conventional filtering materials, like those You can see here, five of them are ion-exchange resin.<br>Because I’m in this business, I know what to do, so those ion-exchange resins are not for radioactivity.<br>They are for heavy metal.<br>Those are for chlorine isotopes … one of them is for radioactive chlorine isotopes, one of them is for radioactive arsenic isotopes.<br>02:55:05<br>And this is … this doesn’t belong to here … [the photo with the Kf CO2 medicine was shortly shown]<br>So this is what is actually being used in this in order to clean up radioactivity.<br>…那就是水<br>因为在水中也不仅有放射性材料还有其他重度污染，像重金属例如我们知道的砷和其同位素，这些不能被CO2甘斯清除。<br>他们实际上必须有一些传统的过滤材料，像那些你看到的，那5种是离子交换油脂。<br>因为我参与这个事情，我知道需要做什么，所以这些离子交换油脂并不用于放射性材料。<br>它们是用于重金属的。<br>那些是用于氯同位素…他们有一种是用于放射性氯同位素，一种是用于放射性砷同位素的。<br>02:55:05<br>这是…这不属于这里… KF CO2药瓶照片被快速显示了一下。<br>所以这就是实际上被用于清除核辐射的材料。<br>So, yes, this is pretty much what’s going on with Fukushima. But although Mr. Keshe didn’t get any credit on himself officially, [ ??? but enough of this ??? scrambled] is working pretty well.<br>And I’m living in Japan, I have two kids, two small kids I have. I’m happy on my side that I can safely live in this country. I can continue to live in this country.<br>But on the other side I kind of feel sad that Mr. Keshe didn’t get any official credit …<br>Mr. Keshe:    That’s … that’s not important.<br>The credit is all of us, we are safer.<br>There is a matter of Medical Application. Can you go into that, please?<br>所以，是的，福岛发生很多事情。尽管凯史先生未曾给予任何官方保证，[……但也足够……]，表现非常好。<br>我现在住在日本，有两个小孩，很小。在这边很开心，我可以安全地生活在这个国家，我会继续生活在这个国家。<br>但另一方面，我觉得凯史先生并未给任何官方保证……<br>凯史：那不重要。我们的全部就是信用，我们（比任何保证）更具有安全感。接下来大约是关于医疗应用领域的，你可以开始了吗？<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Ok, one of the material when I subscribed the CO2 GANS and the copper GANS with TEPCO</p>
<p>Normally I’ve said this is something that this is CO2 CH3 ????????????…<br>”We don’t know such a CO2 and we can not try this material. That we don’t know, … you should give us the MSDS.”<br>MSDS means “Material Safety Data Sheet” which gives as a chemical trading company, when you supply a new material, you give it to the customer.<br>Page 067<br>卡恩：好。一种材料，当我与东电公司签署CO2甘斯和铜甘斯，通常我说，这是某种材料，CO2、CH3……<br>他们说“我们不了解象CO2这些（材料），我不能试用这种材料。我们不了解，……你应该给我们MSDS”<br>MSDS就是“材料安全数据页”，是化学品贸易公司销售新材料时，提供给顾客的。首先，你必须提供“材料安全数据页”，给出这种材料的物理和毒性相关指标。<br>First of all it’s a must, the “Material Safety Data Sheet” which gives you all the physical properties, also the toxicity of the material.<br>So in this case, in Mr. Keshe’s case they had no MSDS.<br>They said: “This is not a normal material and has not a test number.”<br>They said: “No MSDS, it is not a normal conventional material, it’s a new material.”<br>So at that time I couldn’t provide an MSDS and the strange thing was, TEPCO’s reaction was, they did a joke “If you cannot give us the MSDS, we cannot use it. It is highly unlikely that we can accept such an unknown material.”<br>And then what things that happened, the directors have changed at all.<br>And then they said: “Ok, we give it a try. But before giving a try, we need to at least make a test with the toxicity. We don’t know how the workers, if this works, our workers who handle with this material. It looks like it’s a powder in the water, it is a suspension and will be given with it. So we’d like to do the toxicity test before we start doing any further test. Is it ok with you?”<br>I said “Yes, sure, it’s ok” and they did some test for the toxicity of it, before start using it.<br>And then, this is the test was done and I was shown the result of the tests although I wasn’t supposed to go publish it and they didn’t publish.<br>他们说“这不是常规材料，没有测试数据。”<br>他们说“没有材料安全数据页，不是常用材料，是新材料。”<br>所以那段时间，我不能提供材料安全数据页，东电公司的反应比较奇怪，他们开玩笑说“如果你不能提供材料安全数据页，我们不能使用。我们不大可能接受未知材料。”<br>后来，该公司董事改变了这一切。他们说“好吧，我们试一下。但是测试之前，我们至少要对它进行毒性检测，我们不知道工人拿什么器具来操作这种材料，如果它工作的话，看上去象粉末，在水中将生成一种悬浮物，所以 进行别的任何检测之前，我们需要做毒性方面测试，你认为呢？”<br>我说“可以。”然后，在使用之前，他们做了某些毒性相关的检测。<br>之后就做了检测，他们向我出示了检测结果，尽管我不想公布它，他们没有公开出版。<br>I think at that time it was a just normally thing … publishing any paper on what’s going on in Fukushima and they just want to survive.<br>So this is the … And they want to keep it pretty short, the testing of this material, because they are testing not only Mr. Keshe’s material. They tested more than 100 of Ion-Exchange Resin most of them I supplied in order to be used in Fukushima.<br>So this matter was tested pretty much fast and this is how they did the testing:<br>Page 068<br>那时我认为，公布福岛的任何信息不过是寻常的事情，他们仅仅是想要幸存。所以，这些材料的检测（结果），他们只想短时保存，因为，他们不只是检测了凯史先生的材料，他们还测试了100多种离子交换树脂材料，这些大多数是我提供给它们用于福岛的。这些物质很快进行试验，下面就是试验情况：</p>
<p>活力试验功效<br>6组实验鼠，每组6只。<br>每kg体重100微克CO2甘斯，按标准掺入实验鼠食物。<br>第3组5毫克/kg.试验至少4周。</p>
<p>第一组    第二组    第四组    第三组    第五组    第六组<br>仅放射性污染水    CO2甘斯+放射性污染水    患感冒病的老鼠<br>CO2甘斯    CO2甘斯<br>5mg/kg    患感冒病的老鼠<br>    控制组<br>所有老鼠在一周内全部死亡    全部存活    全部存活<br>感冒病毒消失    全部存活<br>未发现CO2甘斯有毒性    全部存活，但感冒病未见改善    活着</p>
<p>Ok, so there were 3 groups of ???rodent??? and mice. And this is pretty much normal for the people who go through a testing with this kind of setup.<br>So every group had 6 mice and there were 6 groups.<br>So the mice except the group #3 there all the mice was given 100 micro, not milli! 100 μg per kilo every day, daily.<br>And this was CO2 GANS. And CO2 GANS was the powder in the water was mixed with the daily diet, daily laboratory rodents diet, mice food diet.<br>好了，有3组老鼠……这是人们进行这类试验步骤的非常标准做法。<br>每组6只，共6组，除了第3组，其余都给100微克每kg体重，不是100μg（毫微克）掺入日常食物，日常实验鼠食物，老鼠食物。<br>第六部分笔译　　穆先生<br>03:00:06<br>And this was CO2 GANS. And CO2 GANS was the powder in the water was mixed with the daily diet, daily laboratory rodents diet, mice food diet.<br>So it means that the rodents looks like they weight between 150g to 200g so per mouse 20μg of CO2 GANS was given. Daily in the foo.<br>As you can see there are 6 groups and the first group was given only the tank water. The radiation contaminated water only. This group #1.<br>And the 2nd group was fed …<br>“Radiation Contaminated Water” means they placed the water …<br>The mice needs to drink water. The water was “Radiation Contaminated Water” also.<br>They put the … aah the food, the laboratory food for the mice they fed is in pellets.<br>And they used to put the highly contaminated tank water onto the pellets and make it absorb so they make sure that the mice eats … consumes the highly contaminated water.<br>Besides there is a water cup in this setup. So if the mice want to drink water, they can go and drink the water. But it looks like the mice didn’t touch the water because I don’t know, because they … if they felt it was highly radiation contaminated or not. Anyhow, so the water looked intact.<br>But also they mixed the highly contaminated water with the food and fed the mice.<br>Ok, the 1st group was only “Radiation Contaminated Water”.<br>And the 2nd group was … those mice are fed …<br>Mr Keshe:<br>The first group you say at the bottom which they were given contaminated water “All died within the first week”.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Yes I think that they died if I am not mistake … it had been more than a year … that had been almost 3 days. All the mice between 3 days, 2 or 3 days most of the mice died.<br>There was only one left. And that one has survived for almost a week. And at the end of the last week this mouse also died, so it’s not ??? All mice have died within … They all died much earlier but the last one survived 3 weeks. That’s why the 1 week [average].<br>And the 2nd group was given contaminated water, it was like sprinkled, put it onto the food and also the CO2 GANS was put onto the food as well, it was also mixed.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>The water? Liquid GANS of CO2, yes?<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Yes, liquid GANS CO2.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Ok, and all the ones in that group survived.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>All the groups have survived.<br>And in the 3rd group:<br>This was supposed to be done actually. On the 3rd group was only CO2 GANS and it was given 5mg/kg<br>They wanted to check as well … The actually reason why they started this was supposed to be dangerous … they told me this was to test the toxicity of the material.<br>And this is the toxicity and they gave 5mg/kg not 100μg/kg.<br>5mg/kg and they tested on the 6 mice and they tried to figure out the toxicity on the mice. If the mice are dying or something or any other adverse effects, nothing is absorbed.<br>And this is the 6th group which is the control group which was given nothing. It’s a control group, so everybody knows what …<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>So in fact the CO2 GANS is not toxic material at all.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Not at all. Even the …<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>This is these two major points. We come back to this later on.<br>So what we understand:<br>We can use GANS of CO2 in condition of the radiation contamination for waters.<br>You can add CO2 into the water when you are in a nuclear disaster condition and that water we should drink from the GANS can decontaminate your body from radiation!<br>Or you can … A minute amount of GANS has been digested by the animals, shows: Radiation contamination non and used to survive.<br>These are important! This is what we call this teaching of today important for a lot of us!<br>Secondly there has been a lot of concern about the toxicity of the CO2, if it’s dangerous.<br>Now we have it from TEPCO: It is not toxic at all!<br>He will explain later on how the test was done.<br>Ok, go to group #4, please.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>After that there was another group. And this group consist of the mice which was purposely got sick. Got a … was given virus a influenza virus. And the 4th group was the influenza group and this group was given CO2 GANS.<br>This is not in to radioactivity and it was just for some reason they have just given the infected mice the CO2.<br>And group #5 was the infected mice plus … plus … aah just infected mice. Nothing [else].<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>With the influenza.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>With the influenza, yes.<br>Group #5 is survived. Group #5 is survived but there was no improvement with the infection.<br>And the group #4 also survived, but the infection has disappeared.<br>So, it looks like the CO2 GANSes compound is working on … somehow is working on with the virus.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yes. Because influenza is a virus. And that’s what we said: This technology is best for the Space.<br>In the Space we don’t have microbes. We have viruses, which are energy, locked into proteins.<br>And this is a clear indication! No Influenza!<br>No influenza at all.<br>In the next few minutes we bring back Benjamin from Ghana. I have received a text: “Shocking news coming from Ghana which repeats the process in Sierra Leone South Africa” … sorry “in Sierra Leone South University.”<br>So what we see now is that you can use [for] influenza. Thousands, Tens of Thousands of people every year die because of influenza. Different shape.<br>And this is a clear indication:<br>No infection. No disease. No sign of influenza.<br>Carry on, please.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Ok. After the test I was called to TEPCO again. And TEPCO got a meeting that the toxicity tests are ok. There is no toxicity happened and they start testing it. They asked for more material.<br>And then I asked more material from Mr. Keshe.<br>Anyway, aah the thing is: When I see these results and they say this is pretty much a common test which is done before they ???deset/did serve???:<br>This material whatever you call CO2 GANS or this white powder in the water … is absorbing it’s in the ion-exchange resin and the virus, the protein covered to viruses consist of plus like the cations. What they tried to filter out is mostly the anions.<br>Ah no! The cations. So aah anions are different. Ion-Exchange Resin take that … they can be pretty much [???use it/chosen???].<br>So, they say: “If this works for virus, this works for the … because the virus is absorbing onto this GANS as far as they know, they absorb these viruses, being absorbed on the GANS by the means of electrostatic force.<br>Which means that the GANSes acting like a negativ …<br>Mr. Keshe:    It’s a magnet!<br>03.10.00<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Yes. And then the viruses, the viruses protein cover is plus. So it comes [???some words scrambled] in operating the virus. This is what they thought. This is what the working mechanism is. So they say this is pretty much the same working mechanism for cleaning-up … for absorbing isotopes from the contaminated water.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Let me add to the knowledge a little bit here.<br>You got to realize why they change, why they tested influenza:<br>st of the workers in Tepco working in the sea level cold winter and they all get sick with influenza. That is why was to see if the CO2, if the workers in the radiation center come in touch with CO2, would it effect, would it have the toxicity, and if they had influenza, would it make them worse? Because they are working in a huge minus temperatures in Japan in the winter time.<br>（03.11.00-03.12.00）<br>So, this is why they tested  it, it was to make sure that if CO2 comes with the touch with the man who’s got a influenza, what would it do, what would it have, would it have the side effect. And they found out:<br>They found even a solution for the influenza! This is why this was tested this way.<br>I request one thing, and that is:<br>If you are very clever and you understood what is on this table, you will understand what is to come after this. I let Mr. Kan finish, and then I will give you a full explanation in what how this will change the total life style of us on this planet. And that is why I said today, it will be a revolution, today is green, a blueprint for a lot of things.<br>Carry on, Mr Kahn.<br>Kahn: Ok, Sir.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Can you tell us, what did they do, they did dissected the animals? What was the procedure?<br>(03.12.00-03.13.00）<br>What did they do after the …<br>Kahn: The animals, after they sacrificed the animals, and what was checked: The liver.<br>The liver was checked due to toxicity and there was no toxicity that was absorbed on the group #3<br>Mr. Keshe:    You are cutting off. You are not very clear.<br>Dr. Kan:<br>Ok, yes. The group [#3], after the test, they cut the mice, they sacrificed the mice, and they cut the liver … it was shown on the presentation, which was shown to me.<br>They took out the liver of the mice on the Group No. 3, and the other groups.<br>But especially for the Group No.3 they were concerned of toxicity, for they were given 5mg per kg.<br>They cut the mice the liver, and they chopped it off, they squeezed it.<br>And then, they did further chemical test in order to observe if there is any toxicity in the liver.<br>And it was shown that the CO2, … the CO2 was not in the liver!<br>So it did mean because it isn’t in the liver: It’s not toxic!<br>If it wasn’t stored in the liver of the mice, it wasn’t toxic. Because most of the poisonous contaminants are stored in the liver!<br>So, there was no sign??? of the CO2 in the livers, so they concluded: This is not poisonous.<br>And then they tried to figure out the way of this is discarded from the body.<br>So, within all the groups, the urine of the mice was collected daily.<br>(03.14.00-03.15.00)<br>This is how they collect … the cages which was the mices kept, … it is like some kind of mesh.<br>The mice living on the mesh and when they give urine or the faeces, they’re dropping so the urine goes under and they collect the urine and the faeces.<br>So they checked the urine of the group.<br>And the CO2, … the CO2 was found in the urine, also in the faeces which is the dropping of the mice. It was found in the mice, so all the CO2 [that] the mice ate was discarded through the urine.<br>(03:15:00 - 03:16:00)<br>So the [???appropriate???] aah the urine in the group no.1 was highly contaminated and the group no.2 was also contaminated!<br>So that is the part they couldn’t give an explanation.<br>Ok, so: The no.1 is contaminated, … no.2 is also contaminated.<br>But this contamination seems not to have any effect on the mices that so the mices survive.<br>But this was the part they got puzzled but they didn’t put too much effort on it, they didn’t care at that time,  and i didn’t care at that time, too. And this is  the way they do the test and they said “ok”.<br>I was happy that they wanted to try this new material, also so stuff, … is clear about … and then they decided going further.<br>So i didn’t really question at  that time how they test, why they test , and they didn’t question, too themselves. So this was the result and it wasn’t toxic. Then they start testing it.<br>So this is what they said after all things were done and right now and they are using this material, and so I’m trying to figure out ways, … this is explaination:</p>
<p>I’m trying to figure out ways to make use of this.<br>So what i did, … what i did:<br>I made a supplement and as well as the Eye Drop, this is the Eye Drop, and this is the supplement which i made in Japan, and this is produced in Japan:</p>
<p>So this is where this is the GANSes in this shape, because i further [???sheer???] I’m a chemical engineer, I further modified the GANS which can be absorbed from the intestine much easier.<br>So I made a GANS, I ate  something already and I made it walk ???(14) over.<br>And I made the GANS usually as a suspension but i made the Eye Drop even out of GANS.<br>And I having distributed this too to people here that I know who is willing to try and especially in the case of Eye Drop the glaucoma, ?????? angle glaucoma, in some cases, ???(17) is dissolved.<br>Page 075<br>So it is  being used and the people who are using it are really … would like to see this as a commercial product, and they are right to buy it, so…<br>(03:18:00-03:19:00)<br>Mr Keshe:    Let me explain why you are there:<br>This is  scientifically based as a chemistry produced. And this is a natural product.<br>So is not man[made] … is not processed product. GANS is natural product, is a new version of free atom.<br>I tell you something, Mr Khan:<br>We promote you, we sell and we take all the risk and responsibility regarding distribution of this material across the world.<br>I am proud to see the logo of the KF. I give you the right, the copyright to the name and the signature right to the KF signature you carry.<br>KF is a copyright owner of the name ‘GANS’.<br>And anybody uses the technology, anybody uses the name:<br>You have to have a copyright rights from us!<br>Anybody uses the logo of KF the way you see or ‘SSI’:<br>From today you need our written agreement!

If you come across disaster in US due to earthquakes or whatever else:<br>You don’t wait for government to tell you: “You can use the GANS” or “You can not do”.<br>We will provide  technology that you can shower yourself  through and with it.We took our time and this is what I said today , this is pleasure to see.<br>I tell you the reason why:</p>
<p>Governments like Chinese government Chinese especially in the poor countries in different part of the world where animals are slaughtered through different kind of flu for chickens or whatever or dogs we hear  it now and then:<br>This water can do the job without damaging the agriculture.<br>(03:22:00~03:23:00)<br>Without damaging the farmer. We can just add it to the water.<br>This stops use of  antibiotics  and other things in the animals without getting absorbed or damaging the toxicity.<br>It’s a  huge change.<br>This is correcting some of the past problems and this is one of them.<br>We are very simple, we asked TEPCO to release data.<br>If you are a Japanese ask how the government of Japan has kept this technology  away from its people where the farmers are getting cancer, and they wash and clean up the power station.<br>You are wondering how the IAEA is  allowing TEPCO to start operating and different nuclear power stations are coming to operation , because they have the GANS technology in their hand.<br>(03:23:00~03:24:00)<br>It’s a dietary element and it is natural material.<br>No one has rights to it, no one can copyright it, because we have taken the rights.<br>‘GANS’ is a registered name. We own the registration.<br>‘Magrav’ is registered name. We own the registration.<br>From now on if you use any of these names:<br>Be sure you have received the permission from the Keshe Foundation.<br>It’s illegal from today to use this name,  if you don’t have the permission from us.<br>So if you think you can make  eye lashes??? or whatever as you see here that you can do and sell.<br>If is not supported with a ? with the Keshe Foundation or the GANS or whatever:<br>We have the right to interfere.<br>Brett:    Mr. Keshe, we also , we own the names<br>‘keshefoundationgans.com’  [??? didn’t see the names on the screen yet ]<br>‘keshefoundationgans.net’<br>we  also ‘kfgans.net’ and ‘kfgans.com’<br>Mr. Keshe:    I own the Keshe Foundation GANS…<br>Brett:    No, I’m  talking about the website .<br>Mr. Keshe:    The ‘gans’ , yes, ‘gans.org’  belongs to the Keshe Foundation , I bought it .<br>Brett:    And I bought the other ones, I am saying that you can use them.</p>
<p>Keshe:    Yes, we know. ‘gans.org’ is , and we allow you to use this , whatever the Japanese nation has let you down, we don’t .<br>Dr. Kahn:    Thank you, Sir.<br>Mr. Keshe:    You are welcome<br>If we will put this as a sold material with a conditions that you have to take the permission to entry it into your country and we rely on TEPCO to provide the scientific material because they are using it for two years.<br>Trial has been done on the workers of TEPCO!<br>Dr. Kahn:  Hopefully one day … One day they are going to release all the data and all the pictures …<br>Mr. Keshe:    Pardon?<br>Dr. Kahn:    I hope one day they release all the data … what they have been doing there … so you can get the credibility …<br>Mr. Keshe:    This is not [about] the credibility.<br>We already are credible!<br>It’s just how they try to discredit us which is the problem for themselves.<br>What I said yesterday to you, Mr. Kahn:    japan.keshefoundation.org<br>It’s your right, to fill it in as we spoke before.<br>You are working in respect to the measurement tools. You have set up the Keshe foundation Company in Japan and you are a shareholder in it.<br>Set it up. We finance you!<br>Produce this material for the Japanese in a way that they can use it to decontaminate their own lives.<br>If it’s good to be used inside TEPCO, … is good inside …[then it’s good] to be used outside TEPCO.<br>This shows a conspiracy within the structure.<br>It’s irrelevant. Now that there is a solution.<br>I think as I said:<br>If International Press gets hold of what is on … being described in past an hour or so by You:<br>The resignation of the prime minister of Japan is on the card.<br>He has betrayed his nation!<br>Let them to suffer with radiation and the rest!<br>But we leave it to International Press.</p>
<p>You [remark of the transcriptors: This ‘You’ is WE!] try to get this section of the teaching on to the International Press. And then we’ll see the response.<br>The technology [has] been developed, tested and belongs to humanity!<br>Not to a few to catch money out of it for United States.<br>Now you understand why they produce so much “anti” and anti information about the Keshefoundation.<br>Because it is what it is. It’s simple. It’s in the hand and the reach of the people. And in so many ways we need it because it’s the knowledge of Space.<br>In the Space, you come across infections and radiation. And you should be able to clean your body from it!<br>And you see how simple it is!<br>This information is over two years old three years now. Am I correct … Mr. Kahn?<br>Mr. Kahn:<br>More than … more … two years.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Two years. And it’s been kept away from Japanese Public!<br>How many people would have saved their children?<br>By knowing, they could give a drop of water and clean-up the body of the child’s from cancer.<br>Very simple!<br>It just washes it out of your body. It doesn’t stay inside your body.<br>Who is responible for this criminal act?<br>Or can we go even higher? To IAEA?<br>Why IAEA has hidden this not to be able to show upper hand in the Iranian negotiations in nuclear?<br>You do not understand the reasons for it.<br>We know!<br>It’s a game played with our lives.<br>It’s a game played with all our lives.<br>It’s a game they play to show they have the power to do what they like.<br>When you shower your plants with the CO2, any contamination which is produced by what you call ‘Chemtrails’ is washed off.<br>When you feed your plants or your animal: Any contamination is washed off!<br>A lot of you have a concern in respect to ‘Chemtrails’, the chemicals which you say they spray:<br>Start taking CO2 in a correct right measure, in a correct manner.<br>You’ll find out: It will be washed out of your body!</p>
<p>This is not a magic. This is understanding the total knowledge of gravitational-magnetic field, understanding due to the spectrum of the carbon and the oxygen in a plasma condition.<br>They attract anything which is in the bandwidth of the total spectrum from carbon to oxygen plus combined.<br>And this is the biggest discovery of the century!<br>Where simple man can help themselves.<br>They said: “The biggest invention was a cart wheel”.<br>But in fact the new biggest invention: “Understanding the plasma as a GANS.<br>03:30:06<br>It will change a lot. It will change the life of a lot of you. Next time summer, winter … you have a flu … you know how many people die in Europe because of the flu in the summer time, in the winter time … because they cannot receive and they becoming immune to the older ones and so they have a problem. The success rate of influenza injections at the moment in Western Europe is between 20-30% and every year it reduces.<br>With this it never will reduce.<br>No old man, no young child should die of influenza with the development of this technology.<br>And … [noise in the background] … somebody is typing.<br>And all you need to ask is: Ask TEPCO!<br>The tests are available with TEPCO.<br>Dr. Kahn:<br>Yes Sir, so … ja it’s TEPCO, ja … done is done and gone is gone …<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>But the thing is: Now we have the data, we can help the others and ourselves.<br>This is the problem.<br>What are we going to to? This is been a very big question mark.<br>That people were saying that TEPCO is dumping radioactive materials into the sea.<br>They are not dumping any radioactive material to the ocean sea. It happened.<br>Now they use the GANS material to dump because they absorb the radiation.<br>In fact there is no difference between this and that one.<br>Let me go through something. It’s very important. Please stay online.<br>I’m going to ask Mr. Kahn: Can you stop sharing the screen, I’m going to bring you back up.<br>We have Benjamin from Ghana. Benjamin, can you come online, please?<br>Dr. Kahn:    Ok.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Just stay standby because it’s in line with what you’ve done.<br>It’s just literally in past 10-20 minutes the results are coming in.<br>Dr. Kahn:    Ok, how can I stop?<br>Mr. Keshe:    Please stop screen sharing.<br>Benjamin:    Hello?<br>Mr. Keshe:    Benjamin, can you come online and tell us what is come from the Atomic Energy …<br>Benjamin:    Am I online?<br>Mr. Keshe:    Yes you are. We can hear you.<br>Benjamin:    Hello?<br>Mr. Keshe:    Yes, we can hear you. Can you tell us what you just received from the Atomic Energy Authority please?<br>Benjamin:    Well … I have recently sent to you pictures from …<br>Mr. Keshe:    I’ve seen it. It’s coming on my computer, coming on my handset.<br>Benjamin:    Ok, so from the report from the lab they have found significant number of E.coli quantity … ok let me see … Quantity of E.coli in don’t treated, polluted water.<br>The one we treated the copper oxide …<br>Mr. Keshe:    Let me stop. Stop. Stop. Benjamin, Benjamin … Benjamin.<br>They have found significant amount of E.coli in the water which you brought from which river?<br>Benjamin:    From river Pra and river Ofin.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Ok, and what did you treated it with?<br>Benjamin:    I treated it with copper oxide.<br>Mr. Keshe:    And what is the preliminary results from the labat the lab ?<br>Benjamin:    The preliminary results from the lab shows that after treatment the number dropped significantly.<br>But I got into him. He saw what you call it Elly to give the analysis.<br>Because [???I said/Assad/I saw that???] now they have a [Hewlett] Packard at the lab so he just asked you you can see some he sent me lot of pictures in of their results and he wrote like I told you before:<br>After the holidays they will be able to bring the documented evidence of their results so that it can be shared or can be published online. Ya.<br>Mr. Keshe:    So the … as we saw with the South Sierra Leone’an University:<br>Using a copper oxide [CuO2] GANS in the contaminated rivers has cleaned up the Ebola or E.coli .<br>Benjamin:    Ya.<br>Mr. Keshe:    So this is in line. We see this is a new health condition which is coming up.</p>
<p>A lot of people go sick because of this. We see the report which is never published by TEPCO but is used by TEPCO.<br>Now we see in Africa a second time confirmation now by the Atomic Energy Authorities.<br>This shines a huge, huge credibility on two organizations, worldwide organizations.<br>One is “World Health Organization” (WHO) how they deliberately silenced this in Sierra Leone.<br>And the other one with a huge question of credibility on IAEA (“International Atomic Energy Agency”), International Atomic Energy Authorities.<br>We always had a doubt in their credibility. Now there is not much left.<br>Now we understand why it was done and how we can use it for our benefit.<br>As I said: Today we finish with a lot of things. And the clean-up has started.<br>This is important:<br>What is on the table, what is to be shown is and belongs to humanity not to any of us.<br>The man who you just heard his voice, he’s lost his income with two children because an Iranian Nuclear Physicist could not be the man who found the solution for the biggest nuclear disaster.<br>Shame on the nation of Japan.<br>How the leadership allows the people to die just to protect hypocrisy which sits in the White House. To sell arms, to kill more, to create a false enemy.<br>Now you see:<br>None of us are each other’s enemy. We work as one team. We work as one group, openly. Data on the table. This literally seconds which comes of the lab.<br>This is how we become ONE Nation. And this is the beauty of it.<br>Mr. Kahn keeps on repeating: I’ve never been given the credit for what I’ve done.<br>I’ve been given enough credit that the technology is getting used and a nation can go back into producing energy. But the only shame is: Why not the citizens enjoying the fruit of the discovery.<br>Can you distribute this material in Japan on its own as it is … Mr. Kahn?<br>Can you open your microphone?<br>Dr. Kahn:    Yes. Can I distribute this material in Japan?<br>Mr. Keshe:    Yes.<br>Dr. Kahn:    Most likely.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Do you have … do you need a license for it?<br>Dr. Kahn:    In order to sell it as a supplement in Japan there is no license needed.<br>Mr. Keshe:    So, please start producing it.<br>Dr. Kahn:    Yes.<br>Mr. Keshe:    You produce it, add it to the soap washing up liquid, add it to the agriculture material and let the Japanese nation to be free of it because every cancer can kill, radiation is a killing machine.<br>We have the tools. Go on the net, go on the television, we support you.<br>Dr. Kahn:    But the thing is, what I like do is more than the radiation itself i’d like to use this for viruses or helping the other.<br>Because by doing this I already crinkled my life … ??? … Fukushima.<br>And I don’t like to sell it as a remedy for radioactivity which i’ve been discredited.<br>Which I’ve been attacked again in various ways. I like to sell it as a normal supplement …<br>Mr. Keshe:    We do it! We do it from the Keshefoundation website. The Japanese Keshefoundation supporters is very deep.<br>Dr. Kahn:    Yes.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Vince … Just stand by Dr. Kahn … Mr. Kahn, just stand by … Vince, are you online? … Ok, take all the details and put this on sale on the shop immediately. We take the responsibility. Let us bring us down at least we know where we go. Make sure it goes on it as a supplement. It’s there they need to get permission from their own country to import.<br>Vince:    Ok if you could send me some pictures it would be great, to the webmaster address.<br>Dr. Kahn:    Sure.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Send all the details. We need a lot of data. Put the report with the mice into it that it can go on it as a scientific evidence.<br>03:40:07<br>And you can call TEPCO. I handled TEPCO, I have no problem. I’ll approach my government immediately in the coming days to see how we can take this.<br>Make a report of this, please provide it to me immediately, send it to my email and i’ll submit it to my ambassador. And we’ll take it on with the Iranian government as a nuclear technology development and we’ll see what we can do.<br>Because a lot of people get damaged by exposure to nuclear materials.<br>A lot of radiation workers. I’ve seen my father being affected by it.<br>03:40:47<br>Now we have a solution. What about a lot of you who go for chemotherapy?<br>And the damage of the chemotherapy is literally untold.<br>We would like to ask the doctors, I know a large number of doctors on the scene:<br>Can you please contact us and try this to see how we support the chemotherapy because it does what it’s supposed to do. But it’s side-effects are not there, which is causing the damage.<br>Can we use the CO2 to reduce the damages of the chemotherapy?<br>That we can allow people to live a safe life?<br>Can we combine when you taking the chemo the CO2 GANS with it?<br>That one does his job and the other one cleans it?<br>Rick:    Mr. Keshe is it possible that by taking the CO2 GANS it could reduce the size of a tumor so that the radiation and the chemotherapy wouldn’t even be required?<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yes!

<pre><code>03:00:06
</code></pre><p>这是CO2甘斯。CO2甘斯粉末水溶液和老鼠的每日饮食混合，也就是和啮齿类实验动物老鼠的饮食相混合。</p>
<p>所以这意味着，这些看起来体重在150g~200g的老鼠，每只每天的食物中供给了20μg的 CO2甘斯。</p>
<p>正如你们所看到的，一共有6组，第一组只供给水箱中的水，就是辐射污染的水。这是第一组。</p>
<p>第2组是喂他们“辐射污染的水”，意味着他们把水放在。。。。，</p>
<p> 老鼠需要喝水。这水也是“辐射污染的水”。</p>
<p>他们把…啊，食物，实验室他们喂养的老鼠的食物，做成小丸。</p>
<p>他们习惯把高辐射污染的水箱中的水，放在小丸上，使其吸收，这样可以确保老鼠吃了…并且吃光了高污染的水。</p>
<p>除此之外，实验设置中还有一个水杯。因此，如果老鼠想喝水，他们可以去喝。但看起来老鼠像是没有去接触这些水，因为我也不知道，因为他们…是不是他们察觉到那是高度辐射污染的水。总之，这些水看上去就完全没动过。</p>
<p> 但是他们仍然把高污染的水和食物混合在一起，给老鼠喂食。</p>
<p> 好，第一组是只吃“辐射污染的水”。</p>
<p>第二组是……老鼠被喂…</p>
<p>凯史：<br>第一组，你说的在最底部的那组，他们被给予了受污染的水，“所有的都在第一周内死亡”</p>
<p>卡恩博士：<br>是的，我认为他们死了，如果我没有搞错的话。这已经过去一年多了，他们大概3天就死了。所有的老鼠在3天内，2天或3天，大部分的老鼠都死了。</p>
<p> 只有一个例外。这一个存活了将近一个星期。而在最后一周末，这只老鼠也死了，所以这难道不是吗？所有老鼠都死了……他们都死了，但最后一个存活了3个星期。这就是说为什么它们平均存活时间为1周。</p>
<p> 第二组老鼠吃的受污染的水，就像被喷撒在食物上一样，这些水和CO2甘斯被同时混合了加入到食物上。</p>
<p>69页<br>凯史;<br>那个水？是液态CO2甘斯，对吧？<br>卡恩博士：<br>对，液态CO2甘斯<br>凯史：<br>好，第二组所有的都存活下来了。</p>
<p>卡恩博士：<br>所有组都存活下来了。<br>第3组：<br> 这应该是实实在在的。在第三组中，只供给CO2甘斯，并按照5mg/kg 的剂量给予。</p>
<p>他们也想核实…他们开始这样做的实际原因，是他们认为甘斯是危险的，他们告诉我，这是为了测试甘斯材料的毒性。</p>
<p>这是毒性测试，所以他们给予老鼠5mg/kg的剂量，而不是100μg/kg 。<br> 他们对测试的6只老鼠采用5mg／kg剂量，他们试图找出甘斯材料对老鼠的毒性。如果老鼠死了，或是其他的不良反应，（这种材料相关的）什么都不会被他们接受。</p>
<p>这第6组是对照组，什么都不给予。这是一个对照组，所以大家都知道怎么回事…</p>
<p>凯史：<br>因此，事实上CO2甘斯完全是无毒的。</p>
<p> 卡恩博士：<br> 一点也没有。 即使是…<br> 凯史：<br> 这是主要的两点。我们稍后再回来。</p>
<p>所以我们理解：<br> 我们可以把CO2甘斯用在水被辐射污染的情况下。<br> 当你处在核灾难情况下，你可以在水中添加CO2甘斯，通过喝甘斯净化的水，可以在辐射中净化你的身体！</p>
<p> 或者你可以…微量的甘斯已经被动物消化表明：辐射污染没有了，动物生存下来。</p>
<p> 这些很重要！这就是我们所说的，今天这一教学对于我们很多人来说都很重要！</p>
<p> 其次，已经有很多对CO2甘斯毒性的关注，如果它是危险的话。</p>
<p> 070页<br> 现在我们已经从东京电力公司得到结果：它完全是无毒的！<br> 他稍后将解释测试是如何进行的。</p>
<p> 好吧，请介绍下第4组：</p>
<p>卡恩博士：<br> 在那之后还有另一组。这组由故意搞生病的老鼠组成。它们得了……得了一种流感病毒。第四组是流感组，对该组给予CO2甘斯。</p>
<p> 这不是防辐射性测试，只是因为某些原因，他们给受感染的老鼠供应CO2甘斯。</p>
<p> 第 5组老鼠是感染流感病毒的老鼠，…就仅仅是被感染的老鼠，没有什么其他的。</p>
<p>凯史：<br> 得了流感的。<br> 卡恩博士：<br> 是的，得了流感的。<br> 第5组存活了。第5组存活但感染没有改善。</p>
<p> 第 4组存活了，但是感染消失了。</p>
<p> 因此，看起来CO2甘斯化合物对…病毒也有作用。</p>
<p>凯史：<br> 是的，因为流感是一种病毒。这就是我们所说的：这项技术在太空中应用最好。</p>
<p> 071页<br> 在太空中，我们没有微生物。我们有病毒，它们是能量，被锁在蛋白质中的能量。</p>
<p> 这是一个明确的迹象！流感症状消失了！</p>
<p> 完全无流感了。<br> 在接下来的几分钟里，我们把本杰明从加纳带回来。我收到了一条消息：“来自加纳的令人震惊的消息，这个过程（指的是甘斯清除病毒）在“塞拉利昂南部”也得到再次验证，……对不起是在“塞拉利昂南部大学”。</p>
<p> 所以我们现在所看到的，你可以把它用于治疗流感。每年成千上万的人死于不同类型的流感。</p>
<p>这是一个明确的迹象：<br> 无感染。无病。无流感症状。</p>
<p>请继续。<br> 卡恩博士：<br> 好啊，测试后我被再次叫到东京电力公司。东京电力公司开了个会议，认为毒性测试合格，没有毒性发生，他们开始自己测试它。他们要求更多的甘斯材料。</p>
<p>然后我问凯史先生要了更多的材料。</p>
<p>反正，事情是这样的：当我看到这些结果时，他们说这是一种他们以前就做过的很常见的一种测试，？？（英文原文不清楚）</p>
<p>这种材料，无论你叫它CO2甘斯或水中的白色粉末，被吸附在离子交换树脂上，包含病毒（阳离子组成）的蛋白质也被吸附。他们试图过滤掉的大部分都是负离子。</p>
<p> 啊，不对！是正离子。所以负离子是不同的。离子交换树脂保留……他们可以相当多[？？？？使用它/选择？？？？英文不清楚]。</p>
<p> 所以，他们说：“如果这项工作对病毒有效，这项工作对…因为他们知道病毒被吸附到这个甘斯上，它们吸收了这些病毒，通过静电引力方式吸附到甘斯上。</p>
<p> 这意味着，甘斯作用像一个负…</p>
<p> 凯史：它是一个磁铁！<br> 03.10.00<br>卡恩博士：<br> 是的。 然后，病毒，包含病毒的蛋白质被包含进来研究。所以它来了（？？？？一些词听不清）操作病毒。这就是他们的想法。这就是甘斯清理的工作机制。所以他们说，这个工作机制和核辐射的清理工作的机制几乎一样…就是从受污染的水中吸收同位素。</p>
<p>凯史：让我再加一点知识在这里。</p>
<p>你要明白他们为什么要改变，为什么他们要测试流感：</p>
<p> 大多数东京电力公司的工人都在海面上，寒冷的冬季条件下工作，他们都得了流感。这就是为什么他们要搞清楚CO2甘斯，如果辐射中心的工人接触到这些甘斯，它是否会有影响，它是否有毒性，如果他们有流感，CO2甘斯是否会使他们病情恶化？因为他们在日本冬天的时候，在一个极低的零下温度环境中工作。</p>
<p>（03.11.00-03.12.00）<br> 因此，这就是为什么他们要测试它，它是要确保如果CO2与得了流感的人的接触，它会怎样，它会有什么问题，它会有什么副作用。他们发现了：</p>
<p> 他们找到了一个解决流感的办法！这就是为什么这个测试是按这个方式进行的。</p>
<p>我请求一件事，那就是：<br> 如果你很聪明，你明白了这张桌子上放着的东西，你会明白接下来会发生什么。等我让卡恩先生讲完，然后我会给你一个关于这将如何改变我们在这个星球上的生活方式的完整解释。这就是为什么我今天说，它将是一场革命，今天是绿色的，是许多事情的蓝图。</p>
<p>继续，卡恩。<br> 卡恩：好的，先生。<br> 凯史：你能告诉我们，他们怎么做的吗，他们解剖动物吗？程序是什么？</p>
<p>（03.12.00-03.13.00）<br> 后来他们做了什么，在…<br>卡恩：动物，在他们杀死动物后检查的是：肝。</p>
<p>因为毒性检查，他们检查了肝，结果是：专门吸收甘斯的第3组老鼠没有发现毒性，</p>
<p> 凯史：你断线了，不是很清楚。</p>
<p>卡恩博士：<br> 好的，是的。第三组完成试验后，他们杀死老鼠，他们割下肝…就像报告上展示的那样，这个报告他们给我看了。</p>
<p>他们取出了第3组老鼠的肝脏，其他组的也都取了。<br> 但对于第三组他们特别关心毒性，因为对他们给了5mg/kg的剂量。</p>
<p>他们把老鼠肝切下，剁碎它，挤榨它。</p>
<p> 然后，他们做了进一步的化学试验，以观察在肝脏上是否有任何毒性。</p>
<p> 结果表明，那个CO2甘斯…肝脏里面没有CO2甘斯存在！<br> 所以这正因为它不存于在肝脏中，它是无毒的！<br> 073页<br> 如果它没有被储存在老鼠的肝脏中，它就没有毒性。因为大多数有毒的污染物都被储存在肝脏里！</p>
<p> 所以，没有任何迹象表明肝脏中有CO2甘斯，所以他们得出结论：CO2甘斯是无毒的。</p>
<p>然后他们试图找出身体排出CO2甘斯的方式。</p>
<p> 因此，他们每天收集所有实验组中老鼠的尿。</p>
<p>（03.14.00-03.15.00）<br> 这是他们如何收集的…保存老鼠的笼子…它是像是某种网.</p>
<p>老鼠在网上面生活，当它们排尿或粪便的时，排泄物会掉下去，然后他们收集尿液和粪便。</p>
<p>因此他们检查了该组的尿液。</p>
<p> CO2甘斯…CO2甘斯被发现在老鼠排泄的尿中，粪便中也有。它被发现在老鼠体内，因此所有的老鼠吃的CO2甘斯都通过尿液排泄掉了。</p>
<p>（03:15:00 - 03:16:00）<br> 那么[？？？？合适的？？？？]，啊，第1组老鼠的尿液是高度污染的，第2组的也是。</p>
<p>所以这是他们无法给出解释的部分。</p>
<p>好了，所以：第一组是被污染了，第二组也是被污染的。<br> 但这种污染似乎没有对老鼠有任何影响，所以老鼠仍然活着。</p>
<p> 但这是他们感到困惑的一部分，但他们并没有对此投入太多的精力研究，当时他们不关心，我也一样。这是他们做测试的方式，他们说“OK了”。</p>
<p> 我很高兴他们想尝试这种新材料，也是新原料，……明显的…然后他们决定再进一步。</p>
<p> 所以当时我没有真正质疑他们是如何测试的，为什么他们测试，他们也没有质疑他们自己。因此，这就是结果，它没有毒性。然后他们开始测试它。</p>
<p> 所以，这是他们在所有事情完成之后所说的事，现在他们在使用这种材料，所以我在想办法，…这是他们的解释：</p>
<p>结论：<br>    辐射致死的方式是通过快速破坏分裂细胞， 这些细胞包括血液、胃肠道、生殖和毛细胞，并损害它们存活细胞的DNA和RNA<br>     但试验表明，口服补充CO2甘斯，有助于加强免疫系统响应，使身体从辐射中毒和病毒中恢复。<br>    CO2可以帮助保护那些在核灾难后暴露在危险的辐射中的人们，如在日本福岛核电站的堆芯熔毁情况，以及人中病毒的情况。</p>
<p>我试着想出办法来利用这个。</p>
<p>所以我做的是。。。我做的是：<br> 我做了一个甘斯应用的补充剂：滴眼液。这就是滴眼液，这是我在日本做的补充剂，这是在日本生产的：</p>
<p>报告的目的：<br>CO2甘斯的医疗用途</p>
<p>因此，这就是我说的，这种甘斯，因为我进一步[？？？？纯粹的？？？？]我是一位化学工程师，我进一步修改了甘斯，使得它可被肠道更容易吸收。</p>
<p> 所以我做了甘斯，我已经吃了一些，我让它走过？？？？（14）（原文不清楚）。<br> 我做的甘斯通常是悬浮液，但我做的滴眼液一样来自于甘斯。</p>
<p>我也向这里的人散发过这个，我知道谁愿意尝试，特别是在视力下降的情况下，青光眼？？？？？？？角型青光眼，在某些情况下，？？？？（17）被溶解了。</p>
<p> 075页<br>所以它是被人使用了，而那些使用它的人真的…想看到这个成为商业产品，并且他们可以去购买它，所以…</p>
<p> （03:18:00-03:19:00）<br> 凯史：让我来解释为什么你在那里：</p>
<p> 这是以化学反应科学为基础的，这是一种天然的产物。</p>
<p> 所以它不是人造的…是没有加工过的产品。甘斯是自然的产物，是一种新形式的自由原子。</p>
<p> 我告诉你一些事，卡恩先生：<br> 我们促进你，我们销售，并且关于这个材料在世界各地的分布，我们承担所有风险和责任。</p>
<p> 我很自豪地看到KF（凯史基金会的标志）。我给你授权，授权允许你使用这个名字以及凯史基金会的KF图标。</p>

<p>我很自豪地看到你在你的产品上带着这个名字。<br> 从今天起，凯史基金会将这种来自日本，东京的材料投入销售。<br> 而条件是：你要对你自己负责。我们已经注册了“甘斯”这个名字作为凯史基金会的版权。而昨天我们已经得到了这个权利。</p>
<p>（03:20:00 ~ 03:21:00）<br>那个带圈的凯史基金会KF标识已授予我们注册。</p>
<p> 我们掌握它。我们拥有它。我们将在本周开始执行我们的名字。<br> 我们已经在世界上注册了21个名字，我们很高兴给你提供使用这个名字的权利，我支持个人的使用。</p>
<p> 如果你想将它提交给世界上任何地方进行认证，我们将提供给你，并让它在你的国家获得认证。</p>
<p> 在灾难发生的时候，就像福岛那些处于灾难中的人们，他们必须有权利挽救他们的生命，他们必须有权利能够去挽救他们的生命。</p>
<p>（03:21:00 ~ 03:22:00）<br> 他们不需要执照。如果你在美国因为地震或其他什么遇到灾难：</p>
<p>你不要等待政府告诉你：“你可以使用甘斯”或“不可以”。</p>
<p>我们会提供技术，你可以使用它们度过灾难。我们为此花费时间，这就是我今天要说，很高兴看到这样。</p>
<p>我来告诉你们原因：<br> 076页<br> 各国政府，如中国政府，尤其是在世界不同地区的贫穷国家，在那里，动物因为不同类型的禽流感病毒而被宰杀，无论是什么动物，或是我们时而听到的狗：</p>
<p> 这水（指的是CO2甘斯）可以在不破坏农业前提下，完成这项工作。<br> （03:22:00 ~ 03:23:00）<br> 不对农民造成伤害。我们可以把它添加到水里。<br>这会停止在动物身上使用抗生素和其他东西，而没有吸收或破坏毒性。</p>
<p>这是一个巨大的变化。<br> 这是在纠正过去的一些问题，这只是其中之一。<br> 我们都很简单，我们要求东京电力公司公布数据。<br> 如果你是日本人，问问日本政府是如何让这一技术远离灾区人民的，那里的农民得了癌症，而正是他们在清洗和清理核电站。</p>
<p> 你在疑惑国际原子能机构为何还允许东京电力公司开始运行其他的核电站，因为他们有甘斯技术在手。</p>
<p>（03:23:00 ~ 03:24:00）<br> 它是一种饮食元素，它是天然的物质。</p>
<p>没有人对它有权利，或有它的版权，因为我们已经获得了版权。</p>
<p>“GANS”是注册名称。我们拥有注册权。</p>
<p>“Magrav”是注册名称。我们拥有注册权。</p>
<p>从现在开始，如果你使用任何这些名字：</p>
<p> 确信你已经收到来自凯史基金会的许可。</p>
<p> 如果你没有我们的许可，从今天开始使用这个名字是违法的。</p>
<p>所以，如果你认为你能做睫毛？？？？或者你在这里看到的无论什么，你可以做它和销售它。</p>
<p> 如果没得到凯史基金会批准，使用凯史基金会或甘斯或其他什么，<br> 我们有干预的权利。<br> 布雷特：凯史先生，我们也，我们也拥有这些名字的版权<br> “keshefoundationgans .com”[？？在屏幕上没有看到名字]<br> “keshefoundationgans.net”。<br>我们还拥有“kfgans.net”和“ kfgans.com’’’</p>
<p>凯史：我拥有“凯史基金会甘斯”……</p>
<p>布雷特：不，我说的是网站。</p>
<p>凯史：“甘斯”，是的，”gans.org”这个网址是属于“keshe基金会的，我买了它。</p>
<p>布雷特：我买了其他的网址，我是说你可以使用他们。<br> 页077<br> 凯史：是的，我们知道。“gans.org’，我们允许你使用这个，无论日本民族怎么让你失望，我们不会的。</p>
<p> 卡恩博士：谢谢你，先生。<br> 凯史：不客气<br> 如果我们想把甘斯作为销售材料，作为条件你必须获得它能够进入你国家的许可，我们要依赖东京电力公司提供的科学材料数据，因为他们已经使用它两年。</p>
<p>实验已经在东京电力公司工人身上完成。</p>
<p>卡恩博士：希望有一天……他们会去释放所有数据和所有的照片……</p>
<p> 凯史：对不起，再说一遍？<br> 卡恩博士：我希望有一天他们释放他们所有的数据，关于他们已经在那里做的……………………这样你可以获得可靠性数据……<br> 凯史：这不是可靠性的问题。</p>
<p>我们已经是可靠的！<br> 这只是表示他们如何试图诋毁我们，这也是他们自己的问题。<br> 我昨日给你说的，卡恩先生：japan.keshefoundation.org<br> 这是给你的授权，在我们交谈之前就填写了。</p>
<p>你在进行关于测量工具方面的工作。你已经建立了keshe基金会的日本公司，现在你也是基金会股东之一了。</p>
<p>建立它，我们资助你！<br> 给日本生产这种材料，以他们能够使用的方式，来净化他们自己的生活。</p>
<p> 如果在东京电力公司用的好，…是内部用的好…那东京电力公司外面也用的好。</p>
<p>这显示了这个体系结构中的一个阴谋。</p>
<p>这是不相干的。现在有一个解决方案。</p>
<p> 当我说话时，我在想：<br> 如果“国际新闻”(可能是一个媒体名称)知道发生了什么事……就像在过去一个小时左右的时间里你所描述的那样：<br> 日本首相辞职将出现在新闻卡片上。</p>
<p> 他背叛了他的国家！<br> 让他们遭受辐射和后续的灾难！</p>
<p>但我们把它留给”国际新闻”。<br> 078页<br> 你（这个“你”是凯史基金会的自己人）试着把这部分的教学放在”国际新闻”。然后我们会看到回应。</p>
<p>这一技术已经被发展，被检验和属于全人类！</p>
<p>而不是少数几个人通过它从中赚钱，为了美国。</p>
<p>现在你明白为什么他们会制造这么多反凯史基金会的信息。</p>
<p> 因为甘斯就是这样的，很简单。它就在人们手中和力所能及的地方。在很多方面我们需要它，因为它是太空的知识。</p>
<p> 在太空中，你遇到了感染和辐射。你应该能够通过它把你的身体清理干净！</p>
<p>你知道这是多么的简单！<br>这个信息已经超过两年了，现在是第三年了。我是正确的吗…卡恩先生？<br> 卡恩先生：<br> 两年多了。<br> 凯史：<br> 两年。它被远离日本公众！</p>
<p>这期间会有多少人能够用这个技术拯救他们的孩子？<br> 正如我们已经知道的，他们可以给一滴水，从而从癌症中清理孩子的身体。</p>
<p>很简单！<br> 它只是清洗你的身体。它不停留在你的身体里。<br> 谁对这一犯罪行为负责？<br> 或者我们追溯的更高一点？国际原子能机构？<br> 为什么国际原子能机构能够隐藏他们不能在伊朗核谈判中占优势的事情 ？<br> 你不理解它的原因。</p>
<p>我们知道！<br> 这是一场与我们生活玩的游戏。<br> 这是一场与我们所有人生活玩的游戏。<br> 这是一个游戏，他们玩着，以显示他们有权力做他们喜欢的事。<br> 当你用CO2甘斯喷洒你的植物，任何你所称的“化学物质”的污染都被清洗掉了。</p>
<p> 当你给你的植物或动物喂食时，任何污染都被冲走了！<br> 你们很多人对“化学物质”很关心，就是你说他们所喷洒的化学物质：</p>
<p> 开始以正确的措施获取CO2甘斯，以正确的方式。<br> 你会发现：这些化学物质会从你的身体中清洗出来！<br> 079页<br> 这不是魔术。这是对磁引力场总知识的理解，因为理解了等离子体条件下碳和氧的频谱。</p>
<p>它们吸收了任何从碳到氧的全谱段范围内的东西。</p>
<p> 这是本世纪最大的发现！</p>
<p>这个发现让简单的人可以帮助他们自己。</p>
<p>他们说：“最大的发明是购物车轮子”。</p>
<p>但事实上，新的最大发明是：“理解了作为甘斯的等离子体”。<br> 03:30:06<br> 它将改变很多。它会改变你们很多人的生活。下一个夏天，冬天……你得了流感……你知道在夏天，在冬天，有多少欧洲人会死于流感，因为他们不接受这个，他们对老的流感病毒有免疫，所以他们就有了问题。流感注射的成功率目前在西欧每年减少20-30%。</p>
<p>有了这个，它永远不会减少。<br>随着这个技术的发展，没有老年人，没有小孩会死于流感。</p>
<p> [背景有噪音]某人正在打字。</p>
<p>所有你需要去问的是：问东京电力公司！<br> 东京电力公司的试验可用。<br> 卡恩博士：<br> 是的先生，所以…东京电力公司，JA…做我们该做的已经做了，发生的它已经发生了…<br> 凯史：<br> 但事情是：现在我们有了数据，我们可以帮助其他人和我们自己。<br> 这是问题所在。<br> 我们要去干什么？这是一个非常大的问号。</p>
<p>那人说，东京电力公司倾倒放射性物质入海。</p>
<p> 他们现在没有向海洋倾倒放射性物质。这在过去发生过。<br>现在他们用甘斯材料去倾倒，因为它们吸收辐射场。<br>事实上，这和那一个没有区别。</p>
<p>让我完成一些事。这非常重要。请保持在线上。</p>
<p>我要问卡恩：你能停止你的屏幕共享吗，我要把你切换到后台去。</p>
<p> 我们有来自加纳的本杰明。本杰明，你能上线吗？<br> 卡恩博士：好的。<br> 凯史：保持待机，因为他做的和你已经做的是一致的。<br> 就在过去的10-20分钟，问题的结果来了。</p>
<p>卡恩博士：好的，我怎么停止？<br> 080页<br> 凯史：请停止屏幕共享。</p>
<p>本杰明：你好？<br> 凯史：本杰明，你能上线来告诉我们来自原子能机构的是什么吗…</p>
<p>本杰明：我在线上了吗？<br> 凯史：是的。我们能听到你。</p>
<p> 本杰明：听得见吗？<br> 凯史：是的，我们能听到你。你能告诉我们你刚从原子能机构得到什么消息吗？</p>
<p>本杰明：嗯……我最近给你寄了照片…</p>
<p> 凯史：我见过了。通过我的电脑，我的手机。</p>
<p>本杰明：好的，所以从实验室的报告中，他们已经发现了大量的大肠杆菌……让我想想…大量的大肠杆菌在未经处理的，污染过的水中。</p>
<p>这些水我们处理过氧化铜甘斯…</p>
<p>凯史：让我打断一下。停止。停止。本杰明，本杰明…本杰明。<br>他们已经发现了大量的大肠杆菌，你从哪一条河流带来的水？</p>
<p>本杰明：从普拉河与奥芬河。</p>
<p>凯史：好的，你是怎么处理呢？</p>
<p>本杰明：我用氧化铜甘斯处理它。</p>
<p>凯史：那么实验室获得的初步结果是什么？</p>
<p>本杰明：实验室的初步结果显示，处理后的大肠杆菌数量大幅下降。</p>
<p>但我得到了他。他看到你叫它为艾莉的那个人做的分析。<br> 因为[？？？？说/阿萨德/我看见了？？？？]现在他们有一个叫做[休利特]帕卡德的人在实验室，所以他只是问你，你可以看到一些他送我的，关于很多他们实验结果的照片，并且就像我之前告诉过你的那样，他写道，：<br> 在假期之后，他们将能够带来关于他们实验结果的记录在案的证据，以便它们可以被共享，或可以在线发表。是的。</p>
<p>凯史：所以…当我们看到塞拉利昂南部大学：<br> 用氧化铜甘斯清理被污染的河流，已经清理了埃博拉病毒或大肠杆菌。</p>
<p>本杰明：是的。<br> 凯史：所以这是一致的。我们看到这是一个新出现的健康状况。</p>
<p>081页<br> 有很多人因为这个而生病。我们看到从未由东京电力公司公布的报告，但被东京电力公司所使用。<br> 现在我们在非洲再次看到了原子能机构的确认。</p>
<p>这闪耀着两家组织，世界性的组织，巨大的信誉。<br>一个是“世界卫生组织”（WHO），他们是如何在塞拉利昂故意压制这一问题的。</p>
<p> 另一个是关于国际原子能机构IAEA（“国际原子能机构”）的巨大的公信力的问题。</p>
<p> 我们一直对他们的信誉有怀疑。现在所剩无几了。<br> 现在，我们明白为什么它会这样，以及我们如何为我们的利益使用它。<br> 正如我所说的：今天我们完成了很多事情。清理已经开始了。<br> 这是很重要的：<br> 桌子上的是什么，要显示的东西，它是属于人类的，而不是我们中的任何一个人。</p>
<p>你们刚才听到他的声音的那个人，他失去了他的收入与2个孩子，因为一个伊朗的核物理学家不能够找到最大核灾难的解决方案。</p>
<p>这是日本的耻辱。<br> 领导层是如何让人们去死的，而只是为了保护坐在白宫的人的伪善。通过卖武器，杀戮更多，制造虚假的敌人。</p>
<p> 现在你看到：<br> 我们中没有一个人是对方的敌人。我们作为一个团队工作。我们作为一个团队工作，公开的。这些表上的数据来自于实验室。</p>
<p>这就是我们如何成为一个国家。这是美丽的。</p>
<p>卡恩先生不断重复：我从来没有因为我所做的获得什么信贷。</p>
<p>我已经给予了他足够的信誉，该技术正在使用，一个国家可以重新生产能源。但唯一的耻辱的是：为什么不让市民享受这个发现的果实。</p>
<p>你可以将这种材料在日本推广吗，以它自己的…卡恩先生？<br>你能打开你的麦克风吗？<br> 卡恩博士：是的。我可以在日本推广这种材料吗？<br> 凯史：是的。<br> 卡恩博士：极有可能。<br> 凯史：你…你需要一个许可证吗？</p>
<p>卡恩：在日本把它作为一个补充剂销售，不需要许可证。</p>
<p> 凯史：那么，请开始生产。</p>
<p> 卡恩博士：好的。<br> 082页<br> 凯史：你生产它，将它添加到肥皂洗衣液，把它添加到农业材料中，这对日本人民是免费的，因为所有的癌症可以杀人，辐射也是一个杀人机器。</p>
<p>我们有工具。你去上网，上电视，我们支持你。</p>
<p> 卡恩博士：但问题是，我喜欢做的事情不只是防辐射本身，我想用这个清除病毒或帮助其他人。</p>
<p> 因为这样做，让我的生活更加多彩…？？？？…。福岛<br> 我不想把它用于治疗放射性，因为这个领域我已经名誉扫地。<br> 这个领域我被以不同的方式攻击。我喜欢将它作为一种正常的补充剂销售…</p>
<p>凯史：我们就要这样做！我们从凯史基金会网站开始做。日本凯史基金会的支持者很多。</p>
<p>卡恩博士：是的。<br> 凯史：文斯…稍等下卡恩…卡恩，稍等下…文斯，你在线吗？……好的，获取所有的细节，马上把这个放在店里销售。我们承担责任。让我们把我们自己带到至少我们知道要去哪里的地方。确保它作为一个补充剂继续发展下去。他们需要得到他们自己国家的许可才能进口。</p>
<p>文斯：好的，如果你能寄给我一些照片就非常好，寄到到网站管理员地址。</p>
<p>卡恩博士：当然。<br> 凯史：<br> 发送所有的细节。我们需要大量的数据。把老鼠实验的报告也放进去，它可以作为一个科学的证据。<br> 03:40:07<br> 您可以打电话给东京电力公司。我经手过的东京电力公司，我没有任何问题。在未来的日子里我会立刻接触我的政府，看看我们如何能接纳这个。<br> 关于这做一个报告，请马上向我提供，把它发到我的邮箱，我将把它提交给我的大使。我们将与伊朗政府一起把它作为核技术的发展，我们将看到我们能够做什么。</p>
<p>因为很多人因接触核材料而受到伤害。</p>
<p> 大量放射工作人员。我看到我的父亲被辐射影响。<br> 03:40:47<br> 现在我们有了一个解决办法。你们中很多去化疗的人怎么样？<br> 化疗的损害简直数不清。</p>
<p>我们想问医生，我知道有大量的医生在现场：</p>
<p>请你们联系我们，试试这个材料，看看我们如何支持化疗的，因为它做了它应该做的。但它的造成损害的副作用是不存在。</p>
<p> 我们可否使用二氧化碳甘斯来减少化疗的损害？<br> 我们可以让人们过安全的生活吗？</p>
<p>我们可否结合使用，当你化疗的同时，使用CO2甘斯呢？<br>一个(化疗)做它的工作和另一个(甘斯)负责清理可以吗？<br> 083页<br> 瑞克：凯史先生，使用CO2甘斯可以减少肿瘤的大小，从而使得放疗和化疗甚至不需要吗？</p>
<p> 凯史：<br> 可以! 日本…中国的研究表明这个工作的方向。<br> 我们需要来自中国的支持来得到这个。</p>
<p> 在过去6周，在阿拉伯联合酋长国我们已经测试了这个对淋巴结肿瘤的效果。我们在等待…</p>
<p>卡罗莱纳州，从那家伙那里，什么时候对你进行了扫描？是的，他们已经做了扫描。所以我们将有望在星期一得到消息。星期二，星期一我们会得到它。<br> 我们知道它减少了肿瘤的尺寸<br> 瑞克：要说一个重要的问题，人们总是马上开始问这个问题：致命的限制剂量是多少，或者多少克的甘斯…</p>
<p>凯史：<br> 它应该是非常小的。我们说得很，很小。但我们不是吃甘斯。我们所做的是：</p>
<p> 我们知道，甘斯的水可以同样有效！</p>
<p>我会告诉卡恩先生来开发这部分。</p>
<p> 瑞克：这是该方法带来的另一最大的问题。有人问是否使用甘斯本身还是甘斯水。</p>
<p> 凯史：<br> 目前我们推荐甘斯水，然后希望在未来的日子里我们看到…</p>
<p> 我们会看到来自于大量药物的许多反对意见。</p>
<p>因为确实的，流感注射带来了数以百万计的这些药品消耗。</p>
<p>另一件事我们必须注意：我们是否可以…</p>
<p>我们现在最大的问题：我们在给我们的孩子注射我们所说的“免疫接种疫苗”。</p>
<p> 随着像甘斯这样技术的发展：</p>
<p> 我们是否需要让很大一部分我们的孩子，由于汞损伤而成为自闭症和生命受伤？</p>
<p>我们是否要用他们所谓的“免疫接种”，来伤害我们自己以及我们的孩子？</p>
<p> 我们是否需要带来这类处理，现在我们已经找到了一个解决方案？</p>
<p>当我们的核工程师，当我们放疗后被辐射。我们可以用CO2甘斯水清洗它们吗？</p>
<p>我们可否创造出足够的甘斯水，让鱼在被我们吃掉之前，能够在其中游动，使得他们得到净化，而我们能够不吃到被污染的鱼？</p>
<p> 这打开了一个巨大的地平线。<br> 因为它来自于世界上最著名的损坏最严重的地方，那里发生了世界上最大能量的核事故。</p>
<p>你必须明白，锶-90是有史以来最致命的系统。这就是为什么他们不能把控它，不能解决它。</p>

Benjamin, can you come online, please?<br>本杰明说：实验室的人在那儿准备解释。本杰明，请你上线好么？<br>Benjamin:    Yes. So one of the guys from the lab is here and he want’s to explain if you can only share some of the pictures that I sent.本杰明：是的，实验室的一个伙计在这里，如果您展示一些我发给您的图片，他想解释一下。<br>Mr. Keshe:凯史先生：<br>You sent them on … I can not send them forward because …你哪天发给我的呢？ 我无法转发，因为……<br>Benjamin:    I should send it to whom?本杰明：我应该发给谁？<br>Mr. Keshe:凯史先生<br>Send it to webmaster.发给网站管理员。<br>I tell you something very strange thing happens:让我告诉你，发生了非常奇怪的事情：<br>We just received a message from Mr. Kahn Sono???.我们刚刚收到了来自Kahn sono的信息<br>“My computer shut down … does not turn on!”我的计算机关机了，不能开机<br>Now you see how effective Japanese are ratted.现在你看到了日本。多么有效<br>Benjamin:    My also did the same.

Ok, carry on.凯史先生：好，继续。<br>Benjamin:    I will open it for him from my desktop and then he can explain …<br>本杰明：我在台式机上打开图片文件让他解释吧<br>Mr. Keshe:    Ok, go ahead.凯史先生：好的，继续<br>Benjamin:    Ok, so, you have two now … so you can explain to them. Let me share my screen …本杰明：有两张图，你可以解释。我共享屏幕…<br>Mr. Keshe:    Can you speak a bit louder, please?凯史先生：请你大声点好么？<br>Craab?:    Yeah, hello …Crabb：啊，你好<br> I’m Craab from the Atomic Energy Commission Lab.我是来自原子能委员会实验室的Craab<br>So we took samples from the water samples and we grew on a media in a “Petri dish”.<br>我们从不同的水的样品中取了几个样品，然后在培养皿里面培养</p>
<p>The dark colored [???] shows the raw water sample.深颜色的展示了原始的水<br>Then the one with the transparence it’s are they shows the treated water.另外一个显示了处理过的水。<br>When you compare the two …比较这两个样本， the dark grow …暗的生长 aah … the dark colored Petri dish shows a lot of colonies. A lot of E.coli colonies.在暗色的培养皿中发现大量的大肠杆菌菌落<br>Then the colonies shown are bigger. They are bigger colonies.显示出大肠杆菌个头比较大<br>But when you also check on the treated water the other Petri dish you could realize that the colonies are small as compared to that of the colonies of the raw water.<br>经过处理的水里培养出来的大肠杆菌比原始的水中培养出来的小一些。<br>And the one of the treated … the colonies are few as also compared to the colonies of the untreated water.而且数量更少。<br>So this shows that the copper oxide (CuO2) minimizes the micro organisms in the treated water sample solution. Ok.在表明氧化铜甘斯大大地抑制了处理过的水样本中的微生物。<br>[ Vince says something not hearable in the youtube video ]<br>Benjamin:<br>Aah … what did you say again? … Ok, so i’ll share, … ok … This can you see?<br>03:50:00<br>This can you see?<br>MTK: Yes, it’s coming up, now we see.<br>Craab?:<br>OK. (Mic change)<br>Yeah, hello, hello? Alright.<br>So we have two Petri dish over there.<br>The one with the brown colonies.<br>Then the one with some – the one with the transparent one.<br>So the one with the brownish colour represents the raw water.<br>Then the one with the transparent one represents the treated water.<br>When you check the brownish colour Petri dish you can realize that the colonies from the units are bigger. The colonies are bigger. And they are plenty there. The E.coli colonies are bigger and they are plenty in that Petri dish.<br>But when you check the transparent one, the E.coli colonies are very small. The colonies are not, … they are smallish in sizes. And they are not that much, in there, they are scattered. But they are not much.<br>But the raw water, the colonies, they are bigger, and they are clumpy. They are so much together in there.<br>Hello, can you hear me?<br>MTK: Yes, yes, yes, go ahead.<br>Craab?:<br>So this shows that the treated water with the copper oxide minimizes the microbial activity in the water and it do not give any effects when it is been ingested into the body.<br>So this is what I have found out in the laboratory.<br>MTK: What does this exactly mean now? When we treat the water with the copper oxide?<br>Craab?:<br>Yea, which means that it reduces the number of micro-organisms in the water, in the raw water sample.<br>Because looking at the brown Petri dish and in the transparent where you can see clearly that the brownish coloured Petri dish contains much colonies of the E.coli.<br>And then the transparent one contains lesser colonies of the E.coli. So when you treat with copper oxide it minimizes the microbial activity in the water sample.<br>MTK: Does that mean that if we put the water through the second process with the copper oxide, would that bring this (front?) totally below the level? Or is it already below the levels, Standard International Levels?<br>Craab?:<br>Yea, we are here to check for the international levels. So by Tuesday we will finalize everything to check whether they are below the international levels. So they are within the international levels.<br>MTK: Aaah, but according to your experience: How much better is what we see datawise? From what we see now physically?<br>Craab?:<br>Yea, so according to my experience, the proof over there in the transparent one, it should be … the colony should be small (then/and) they should scatter.<br>So (which/this) shows that they are within the acceptable limits. Yea.这表明在可以接受的范围内<br>MTK: So, in a way by … What is the cause of these E.coli in the water? Is it because of the animal excrement and washing alive animals in it?<br>Benjamin:    Mr. Keshe, it may be. It may be because … what you call it … apart from people, maybe people relieve themselves in the bushes so as I shared in my first presentation, sediment that are washed from the soil end up (you know) polluting the water and thereby (you know) breeding E.coli in the water bodies.<br>So I mean it can be a contributive factor that the way people relieve themselves in the bush and (you know) from also the killing of or washing of animals and washing of even …<br>03:55:00<br>Some people even stand in the river and then bath, you know?<br>That is something that I saw. But you cannot do … for me in my position I can not do anything about it [Benjamin must laugh while speaking the last words].<br>But we have to (you know) keep on announcing or bringing the … creating the awareness that these things are not (you know) good for water bodies like that. So …<br>MTK: Yea, but can I ask a vital question? By, ok, this is good we can not do all the rivers, but by using CO2 [Remark from the transcripters: We think, CuO2 is meant], do we take all the good and the bad out of the water, we just have a liquid?<br>Do you know what I mean, are we taking everything with this process?<br>Craab?:<br>Yes, I think we can take majority of the micro-organisms.<br>So, I think by treating it, we have to check the level of the GaNS as which the groove can be picking. Let’s say if we take 30% of the copper oxide to do the treatment at which percentage of the groove can be removed.<br>Let’s say if 50% can remove all the micro-organisms then we use 50%.<br>If 70% can remove, or the, so we have to check the percentages at which we use the copper oxide to treat the water. So it will depend on the percentage of the copper oxide we use of the water.<br>MTK: Ok, so what we’re going to get is cleaning up, but effectively cleaning up. But to the point that the water is totally pure without any sediments, it’s just a water. Am I correct?<br>Benjamin:<br>When I took the samples to the Lab, Daniel actually shook the, what do you call it, the treated water, so the sediment was mixed up. With the, what do you call it, it was mixed up like before.<br>And then I asked him “Why? I told you, only collect the surface clean water to treat.”<br>But he said: “No, let’s do it this way. Another time we can only collect the top layer of the water and then treat it that way.”<br>So that’s how (it) comes that even we find a lot of, how do you call it, E.coli trace even in the treated. And then the plenty in the untreated.<br>So that is how it come. But next time I will recommend that he just skim the surface of the water and then treat it or (cocher?) it and see how significant the upper layer will, you know, the result that the upper layer will give. And see. Also.<br>MTK: Yes, that’s fantastic. … What can we do:<br>We wait till next Thursday meeting.<br>Please check the column datas with everything. Because what we’re gonna do, we gonna submit this for a, what you call it, as a standard for the Keshe Foundation on our website. Because we set up a new standard without the cuts. Ah, so, as we done up to  now.<br>I just received something very, very interesting. It’s come from german manufacturing of the Keshe Foundation.<br>It says:<br>04:00:00<br>“We as a german group, we are fully support the production of CO2 and market it as a supplement. Greatings.”<br>So we see the process and we will support this move because a lot of people need it.<br>Please, Benjamin, do a little bit of ground work, do a little of ground work before you come up with the presentation next week:<br>Check all the datas that they are real not just because they are typed. And we will leave it on the website of the Keshe Foundation, as the testimonials from the “Atomic Energy Authority of Ghana”.<br>We… This is a fantastic news.<br>Let’s see what else comes.<br>We knew this from South Sierra Leonean University. We are going to put you in touch with them, I’m going to you in touch with the professors of South Sierra Leonean University, with the Vice Chancellor  there who is a friend of the Foundation. And there we will see how we can take this out across all Africa.<br>Benjamin : Thank you<br>MK : Thank you very much for your work. You are a … what I call it … a treasure to have !<br>Benjamin : I am stop sharing my screen.<br>Conclusion<br>MK : Thank you Benjamin, thank you professor !<br>Any… anything we have seen today, as I told you we have gone into the clean-up.<br>We have cleaned up religious people that there are no more any. We use the GANS of the will of God on them.<br>Now we use the gans of CO2 and we have seen with Fukushima, we have seen that coming from Ghana.<br>From now on, we just keep on submitting and delivering new technologies which can change the past. This is not our job in the Keshe Foundation.<br>It’s Our Job as Keshe Foundation WORLDWIDE: You are doctors, You are scientists, You are people who can make the difference.<br>4:02:14<br>Take up the position, take up the list and take up the whole understanding of the technology and support the Keshe Foundation and support the whole structure to change the messes we have created.<br>It’s us who got to move not waiting for somebody to do it for us.<br>We waited long enough that abused us. As I said very recently, I am proud to be human being because I am proud to be Iranian. I am proud to be part of the humanity when it helps each other to the best of his ability.<br>But it is shame when we see how financial positions dictates the conditions of the life of the others.<br>4:03:23<br>What are we interesting is, now that we have disclosed this:<br>If you people who are there this section of TEPCO. Segmented and delivered to all the Japanese companies, Japanese Keshe Foundation, Japanese internet connection and let it<br>go free on the internet with it. I wonder how much more is sitting in the background with other organizations who are taking and developing our technology.<br>As I always told you: We, as a group, people who sit around Keshe Foundation, can do so much. We have limited restrictions in finances, we can do, governments don’t have.<br>You have to realize something very interesting:<br>You live in the West Coast of the USA, and you  say you received all the radiated fish which is coming there and you won’t eat.<br>Make yourself copper oxide GANS (4:04:31) put it in the water, stir it, let it settle, take the water, put your fish in it, let it swim in it, let it rest in it.<br>And you rest assured you take [away] all the radiation which came from Fukushima floating into you.<br>04:05:04<br>This is not for abusing, this is for using it the correct way.<br>If you live in the contaminated areas, radioactive contaminated areas, chemically contaminated areas. Now we see this as a solution. Do not consume it. Let us the organizations around the world to come in it and come with it.<br>Consume the water.<br>We know one thing : a large dosage over 1 mg is too much, far too much.超过一毫克的量都太多了。<br>It is a powerful structure, it is a source of energy. So you have to watch, you have to understand how much is going to be done and how much needs to be done.<br>A lot of you are producing a lot of these materials. A lot of you are producing pens and pads and the rest. But you have to understand one thing : is how much would we like to do this ?<br>4:06:20<br>Can we change the course ? Can we create a new course without fighting ?<br>I told you it’s easier to work than fight. And now we have seen it. But we need it to release this knowledge today in different shape of form.<br>Because all of us are going to be affected by the radiation. All of us have been affected by radioactive material. We have no choice. We have no choice but to look for avenues where we can support ourselves, where we can make the change. Where, how we decide, can bring the change.<br>4:07:43<br>Bam : Mr Keshe ? Mr Bam from Argentina!<br>MK : Yes !<br>Bam : We are in a big problem here in Brazil and Argentina and Paraguay with the (? - 4:07:54) additives and we see different pests, and they are contaminating the air with spray guns continuously and apparently the product used in Brazil, built by apparently Monsanto, to blame for the problem that newborn kids having with their born with small brains.<br>You must have heard on that on the news !<br>MK : Yeah !<br>Bam: Interesting thing would be for people in Brazil and now to get in touch with people here, if they could start spraying with CO2 water !<br>MK : Yeah !<br>Bam : That would be very good ! (? - 4:08:42) till we got, at least a couple of more month with a lot of problem with these pests.<br>(noisy)<br>MK : Please switch your computer off ! Water them… with the GANS, the water of GANS of CO2.<br>Bam : (noisy)… a couple of week ago when I had (? - 4:09:08) in the eye, then I had tried CO2 water.<br>MK : And ?<br>Bam : Well I am fine ! I had some fever but I am stabilized and I am perfectly well !<br>MK : So, use it !<br>Bam : Fine ! Yes ! I am spraying it all over the house and I have given it to some other people that work with me, yes.<br>MK : We have to learn : it is a new understanding. It’s a new way of living and it is the way we want it to be. Now we have the chance to do it ourselves. Now, we have the chance to create that conditions ourselves.<br>Bam : But over sixteen years ago, I have tried a product which is water with marvellous, super-ionized water. I don’t know if you have ever heard of it.<br>04:10:00<br>John: which is water which is marvelous which  is surprise?????? water, never heard of I adore you a Turkish below who make this water is normally in Germany lately and the property of this water fantastic, he could sort of  try both things together .<br>Rick: John, be great for get you do you got a  new microphone and repair connection   reheard, very harsh to  listen to …the voice concerns…<br>Benjamin: It’s loud.<br>Rick: Yes, it’s very loud in over amplify , thank you.<br>Keshe: we have Benjamin, Benjamin, can you switch your microphone off  Please , cause get feedback. Benjamin, you are on the line, you are asking to come to back in come back?<br>John:    Does  my microphone get better now?<br>Keshe:    Yes.<br>Rick:     It does seem better yes .No , no, no sorry mute , mute , mute , we gonna have to stay mute  John. Just too much coming through.<br>Mario Kienappel:    It’s not just loud , it’s too terrible noise .<br>Rick:    Yes.<br>Keshe:    Benjamin, sorry about this, it’s okay, we understand we always had this problem even with our own units.<br>Benjamin can you come online you want to speak ?<br>John:    I put my loud speakers off now.<br>04:12:00<br>Benjamin:    OK, Sir.<br>Keshe:        Come in, you want to you have a professor from …<br>Benjamin:    I am online.<br>Keshe:        Yes, you have a professor from B&amp;AR/BANR with you?<br>Benjamin:    No, I don’t have the professor with me now , but what they have witnessed in the usage of the system I have here the BEADs, the Magrav BEADs.<br>I tired … I wanted to do the spring ones for them,  but you know because of what the woman , the two scientists  who came from Kenya, because of their results , everyone of them wants to work with the woman you know ???with them, so all of them have asked me to design the BEADs for them.<br>And I have done a lot of them for most of them.<br>I think we can …<br>On Friday I had a request from the main university campus, university of ???<br>04:13:00<br>The campus four professors requested the what you call it the BEADs unit from me, so they were on me, I have to sit during the weekend and then do it for the four of them …<br>So on Monday early in the morning they were at my door: “Have you finished?”<br>I handed over to them,  so they are testing it and the doctor who was here the other day  Dr. ??????  have also been using it in his house and what he’s saying is that the meter, when it treat normally …  when you buy the unit it beeps when it stick in, your unit’s consuming, the unit it beeps.<br>But since he plugged the unit on, it has stopped beeping and the unit is not going at all, it’s not you know dropping like it’s used to be.<br>And I got into doctor Dansu??? the head of the ???BiNarI???,<br>That is the biological nuclear we said institute.<br>He was the first one  who requested that for it because of the testimonials of the women.<br>And I send the guy who (you know) delivered the product to him …  I asked him to find out how (you know) significant he has (you know) benefitted and he told the guy that:<br>“Look I used to buy about 500 units 500 Ghana units every 3 weeks, but now I’m not buying that much at all. I have bought once and it is (you know) still there so there is a significant (what you call it) reduction.”<br>And I told him: “Yes, wait for  3 months  and then (you know) you will come to me.”<br>And a brother of mine also , I did it for him and then he took it to his house he said:<br>04:15:00<br>“Normally one day unit reaches 3 units it stops. You have to buy a new unit to load it up. What happens?”<br>He told me that this thing has even not stopped and it went up to zero zero for 3 days before the system shut down.<br>So he was asking me: “What happened?”<br>I said: “I don’t know. Heheheehe. I don’t know. You just go and find out. Find out”<br>And what actually happ… what happened also was:<br>When he was going to load the unit … normally you can sit in your house and they load the units, transfer the units to your system.<br>He did … he went there 3 times. The people told him they can not load the units onto his system.<br>He show … Go back and check his meter.<br>And I said: “What did you tell them? I hope you didn’t tell them you are using the system”.<br>He said: “No”.<br>After the 3rd time he said he decided not to go again.<br>So onto the system went off and then they were able (you know) to load it.<br>So, there are many (you know) testimonies coming in here and there.<br>What I’ve planned to do is to line up these people and they are here so you can easily get access to them if they cannot (you know) come personally I can record them and then share the testimonies with the people watch (you know) they they have found by their uses of the what you call it Magrav Unit.<br>The Magrav BEADs.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Thank you very much.<br>Are there any questions or shall we call it the day?<br>We received enough information today as it is. We started 09:00 o’clock it’s nearly 13:30.<br>We’re going for nearly 4 and a half hours.<br>Rick:<br>Yes, there is some out there to think about Mr. Keshe<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>There’s a lot to be done. And now we just opened the Pandora Box.<br>Rick:    Mhmm, mhmm.<br>Ok, so, is joiny wrap up that we can do here … last quick questions perhaps or shall we as Mr. Keshe says call it a day?<br>Going once, going twice … call it a day …<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>A lot questions sitting here, I can see.<br>Someone is talking in the background, yeah.<br>Can I present some GANS making … findings?<br>Mr. Keshe:    Who is that?<br>Berncron:    Berncron.<br>Mr. Keshe:    Yes.<br>Berncron:<br>If I can share screen? … Can you see that now?<br>Mr. Keshe:    Yes.<br>Berncron:<br>So, these are jars of GANS I made and this is recorded a week after I sealed them. Still this aftered???</p>
<p>Mr. Keshe:<br>What is it for juice? Ah, these are your GANS?<br>Berncron:<br>Yes, yes.<br>And then how I do it is with the coils instead of the plates …</p>
<p>hooked up to a cellphone recharger … and it literally will make a top of them within about an hour.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>We do that in the factory. The process we understand fully. We do that in the factory.<br>Berncron:<br>So it’s a pretty easy way if you want people replicating the CO2 everywhere very fast.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Yea but is not a CO2. CO2 is not produced this way. CO2 has to be produced in the normal condition. You are producing the copper oxide or a zinc oxide.<br>Berncron:<br>Well and many others depending on the material used.<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>On the material you use, yes.<br>That’s perfect. Thank you very much.<br>Any other question or shall we call it the day?<br>Rick:    Let’s call it the day there, Mr. Keshe<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>Ok. Thank you for being here today. We learned a lot. We shared a lot. And we wrote a lot of things off.<br>What we wrote off is the division in the religion.<br>What we wrote off is how we can clean-up the structure of the rivers, the waters we drink, radiation contamination, and most of all we have seen how collectively working together … openly … even though it gets used by the others for their benefit.<br>It brings benefit in totality for all of us.<br>Please cut these teachings in sections and let appropriate people have the sections to understand what it is.<br>We are not afraid of sharing.<br>We are afraid of not sharing.<br>That’s the biggest problem. Up to now people were afraid to share that something might happen to them. We’re afraid not to share that our knowledge might not be used to save a life.<br>So, in so many ways we are back to where humanity should have been from the beginning.<br>We are the new generation of “Not what I call Givers”.<br>We give unconditionally without bothering of what we give which allows the others to go faster, to live a better life and to be able to live a more comfortable life from what we give.<br>My knowledge is free.<br>It’s your life who’s got to accept it.<br>Thank you very much for you today. We learned a lot. And maybe we learned something more.<br>When it comes to tomorrows. Maybe we can go further if we ask ourselves one question:<br>“Have I given enough today?”<br>Thank you very much for today.<br>See you on Tuesday afternoon teaching.<br>Have a wonderful Easter holidays. Those of you who believe in the path of Christ blessed his name.<br>Thank you indeed.<br>Rick:<br>I’m sure I’ll have some questions for you for the Tuesday workshop<br>Mr. Keshe:<br>I’m always there. No problem.<br>Thank you very much, Rick. Have a nice holiday.<br>Rick:<br>Thank you Mr. Keshe. By for now and that will be the end of the 106th …<br>Sandy:    Rick?<br>Rick:    Hello?<br>Sandy:<br>Can you just mention about the joined Q&amp;A session this afternoon, please?<br>And that will happening for the 1st and 3 year students in an hour?<br>Rick:    Can you mention about that?<br>Sandy:<br>Ha ha, I guess I should do that. I don’T want to mention the Zoom number because it is a private Zoom for the 1st and 3 year class. But it will be under the Q&amp;A Zoom meeting number and will be starting in an hour. And I’ll be hosting.<br>So that’s 9:30 central … no his is eastern daylight times, so people can adjust.<br>Rick:    Yes, 6:30 am pacific time. I’m not sure about this.<br>Vince:    For that everybody at least on our end of the world has to aware of that CET time goes forward again on Sunday. So next week’s workshops will be an hour earlier. An hour earlier for the western world here.<br>Sandy:<br>Well we go back to fix our difference opposed to the ??? difference here.<br>Vince:    Exactly, exactly.<br>Rick:<br>Yes, it’s a confusing time year twice a year with that changes.<br>Thanks for the reminder.<br>Someone else:<br>Who don’t you use the GMT time table … ??? [hard to understand acousticly the rest]<br>Rick:    Yeah, then when we get off planet, we have to convert to something else again. Hahaha.<br>Ok, so I think we should wrap it up for now.<br>Is there any other announcements we should put in there?<br>I believe there is also a teacher meeting, correct, today? Do you want me to put that in as a reminder?<br>Sandy:        Yeah, the teachers meeting is after the Q&amp;A.<br>Rick:<br>Ok, let’s wrap it up for now. I stop the lifestream …</p>
