<p> 笔    译：第一部分 拈花一笑<br>    第二部分 阿基里斯<br>    第三部分 郑泉<br>    第四部分 一步穿锣<br>    第五部分 刁义芬<br>    第六部分 Fanjiaxin<br>    第七部分 子不语<br>    第八部分 郑泉<br> 整     理：拈花一笑</p>
<p>第一部分笔译——拈花一笑</p>
<p>Keshe (K): As usual good morning, good day. We had a false start and in the time of resetting, a lot had to be reset. Thank you for observing the four days. I was the last person to see Fabio leaving last Wednesday on the left side of the car as the driver and somehow unknown to us, nobody else, Fabio was found on the right side of the car at the point of the accident. I was the last person more or less to see him before the coffin was closed in my village. In so many ways we spent weeks here with him. I spent 6 or 7 hours a day with him in the teaching room upstairs. I learned a lot, had a lot of joy and a lot of respect for him. Caroline said that he came here as a boy a year ago and left as a man with a lot of respect. I thank you for observing the 4 days of celebrating his life. I watched this video many times and I could not see or understand such a position was possible.<br>凯史先生：和往常一样大家早上好白天好！我们赶上一个错误的开始和时间重置，很多事情都不得不重来。感谢你们这四天来的关注，上周三我是最后一个看到法比奥离开的，他从左边上去开车，我们没有人知道发生了什么，在车祸现场，却在车子的右边找到的法比奥。在他盖棺之前我大概也是这个地球村最后一个看他一眼的人。在这里，在各种活动中我们和他度过了很多个星期，在楼上的教室里我每天有六至七个小时和他在一起，我从他那里学到很多，分享到很多快乐，以及他的很多尊重。凯诺林说，一年前他来的时候还是个毛孩子，现在却在很多方面变成男人。在对他生命的赞颂的四天中，感谢你们持续关注。这个视频我看了很多遍，我想不通不理解在那个地点发生事故的可能性。</p>
<p>K: today in a very open way but in the way of the language of those who understand the communication I will transfer 4 different words and ways of information. Fabio’s death was not an accident. In time I will open the books. I received communication from the head of the states and in trying to communicate a lot has been opened. There are those who tried to force for the change that was supposed to come last week to slow it down. There were those who wanted to keep the status quo. We changed the status quo and today we will teach in several different ways. Those of you who tried to force the change I have a message for you: your time is over; go back home. You took a physicality with the soul of the man and we take your soul back home where you came from. You are finished. You understood. We sent you here to mature man and you picked up the habits of the man. We sent you here to promote the soul of the man and you played the game of the man. You know the punishment. According to the universal council you have called back and under the orders you will meet your destiny at the point you know you have to go. Those of you who never understood the meaning of this, this physicality with the soul we interact with, this is a sign of the universal contact. And those who taught the man the knowledge of the universe and abused it will meet their own punishment according to the law of the universe.<br>凯史先生：今天，我们以非常公开的方式，在这种情况下，谁都知道这种通信方式[是透明的]，我将传递四层不同的意思和讯息：法比奥不是死于事故，我将花时间公开相关书信，我收到不少国家首脑的来信，他们试图联系我们，很多都已经公开，上周有人想用暴力方式来改变对我们的支持，让这些展示减慢，那些人想留住他们的身份地位，我们改变了这些身份地位，今天，我们会以几种不同的方式教学，你们想用暴力来改变，我有办法对付你们，你们的时代结束了，滚回老家去吧！你们夺走一个人的灵魂的肉身，我们却让你的灵魂回归它的来处，你们玩完了。你们应该已经明白了，在此我们传递的知识让人类成熟，而你们却摘取人类的习性，在此我们传递的知识提升人类的灵魂，而你们却玩人类的把戏，你知道是有惩罚的，根据宇宙委员会[的规则]，你已经被撤销，时空一到，你必须面对你的命运，你知道，你不能逃脱。那些人从不明白这里面的深意，与我们关联的这些灵魂和肉身，他其实是联结宇宙的记号。</p>
<p>K: the leaders who followed and fooled the others and those who brought the entirety of the soul of the man to be a slave through playing parlor games, your term is finished. We teach the man today everything and then you will understand the terms and the universal councils and how we will deal with these situations. We sent those who were to be observers in passing the knowledge to be observed according to the laws and they got carried away to play the games too. In the past thousands of years in a number of ways we tried to influence and to bring man to peace. But it became the mayhem of one group or other playing the same game as the man across this planet. Your term is finished. We bring the knowledge to the man today that those of you who committed the atrocities of the past years will come to understand the time has come to be served by the universal council and the way we work through the human body. We don’t punish.<br>凯史先生：那些效法的领导者，愚弄别人的领导者，你们通过密室游戏引领人类灵魂成为奴隶，你们的时代结束了。今天我们教导人类方方面面，你将明白又一个时代到来，并且宇宙委员会将会介入这些情况。我们给予的知识让那些在旧的知识体系下作为审察者的人们，变成为根据宇宙律法被审察，你们也要离开那些游戏退场了。过去数千年来，我们以多种方式试图感化并带领人类走向和平，但是这些努力变成了一伙人对人类的伤害，或者是同样的游戏在这个星球上换个玩法。你们的时代结束了。今天我们把知识带给人类，过去这些年，那些人挑起暴行，人类将看透这些把戏，现在是宇宙委员会服务人类的时间。我们通过人体运作的方式，我们不治罪。</p>
<p>K: the man or entity who takes the life of another man on a planned basis to achieve what he wants to do, but trying to be impartial in the positions like we have here is that we give the soul of the murderer to the soul of the murdered. And then he has to live with the physicality of the murdered. This you will not understand, but in the future you will understand. In a way it means you have to wear the shoe of one you have murdered and as you know you cannot fit into everyone’s shoes. This is the punishment and this is how it is. Encapsulating the body of the man is nothing but encapsulating the soul within the soul of the man means becoming a slave to your own soul and in time you will understand. In many of my teachings I explained this in the matter state and a lot of you when you look in the materialistic world did not understand it. I drew pictures of the spinal plasma and I put copper and zinc and then you understand the lighter cannot exist without the one that is the stronger. And then you understand how the universal council gives the man to serve himself his own punishment.<br>凯史先生：在这个行星上，这个人或存有夺取别人生命来实现他的企图，但是以我们的立场，我们试图公平无私来对待这个杀人凶手的灵魂，但是他不得不带着他的犯罪的身体活下去，这一点你们不会理解，但是将来你们会理解。一方面意味着你要穿上一只杀人犯的鞋子，因为你知道你不适合穿任何别人的鞋子。这就是惩罚，这就是惩罚你的方式。压缩人的身体感觉没什么，但是把人类的灵魂关进他自己的灵魂里面，意味着你自己成为你自己灵魂的奴隶，一段时间内你就会明白。在多次教学中我解释过这方面，在物质状态下，你们很多人只看见物质有形的世界，你们过去没理解这些。我画过等离子体的骨刺图，放进去铜和锌，然后你理解如果强度不够的话光是不会产生的，你就会明白宇宙委员会怎样帮助这样的人从他自己的惩罚中得到拯救。</p>
<p>K: When we give the finger and we close it means it is the time of punishment and you have been served. And those who understand the language of the finger understand what it means and what is to be done. You depart and you take your position and the ones you brought to educate to serve mankind and abuse it stand for their term of punishment. I bring the clear coded message on the Tuesday teaching and I received the response in less than 24 hours from those who knew who had done wrong.<br>凯史先生：当我们伸出手指，然后我们卷回来，意味着惩罚的时间到了，你已经在服役，那些懂得手势语言的人理解这个，意味着某些事情已经做了。<br>WH$0Q6VD(8_LBG4CTI44DT3       Y%NLSG3})QYMNAYRJ]{@@YJ<br>你离开和放弃你的位置，这个位置是你带领和教育人们服务人类的位置，你却滥用在他们的犯罪和惩罚方面。在周二教学中，我传达了非常清楚的信息，在不到24小时内我收到来自这些人的回应，他们知道并且犯下了这个错误。</p>
<p>K: So, as I said we are entering man into the universal community so you have to understand the basic rules of the universal community. When you come in touch you don’t interfere and you don’t use the knowledge which you have to create conditions for you to confirm that you have the knowledge and play power games. Those who have done (this) will depart in the coming time and you will be escorted where you know exactly to be.<br>我说过，我们人类正在进入宇宙社区，所以你必须理解宇宙社区最基本的规则。当你来到宇宙社区进行接触，你不要干涉，你不要利用那些知识，除非你建立利用这些知识和玩能量游戏的条件。在接下来的时间里，犯下这些事情的人们将被分离，你们将会被护送到那个你心知肚明的地方。</p>
<p>K: Those world leaders who have been in touch and to whom the information has been disclosed we warn you, we turned back to the position of peace and some of you who have committed atrocities you have to stand the same punishment exactly as has been in the universal council. World leaders you made a mistake. I have been told not to mention names, but President obama, you are online and you can come any time and explain how you have made a Black House out of the White House. We know you are online and we invite you to speak the silence is confirmation of the crime. For those of you who have started understanding the work of the universe and what we teach now, you will see more. We have a message for you: from today you start the process of entering the dimension of understanding where physicality has no dimension but your emotion and your soul will dictate the terms and conditions. You will understand by the end of today</p>
<p>凯史先生：我们已经接触那些世界领导并传递给他们信息，这些事情已经公开，我警告你们，我们回归和平的原点，而你们一些人挑起暴行，你们已经走进同样的惩罚里面，就算你已经加入宇宙委员会也毫无差别。这些世界领导犯下了错误。我已经被告知不要提起这些人的名字，但是，奥巴马总统，你在线上，任何时候你都可以来解释，你怎样在白宫之外创造了一个黑宫，我们知道你在线上，我们邀请你站出来说话，沉默就表示你认罪。为了那些已经开始理解宇宙工作的人们，我们正在教大家，你们将明白更多东西，我们有一条讯息给你们：从今天起，你们进入了理解维度的进程，不再是物理维度，你的情感和灵魂决定位置和条件，今天教学结束你将会理解这个。</p>
<p>K: Those of you who tried to override the situation and when I am here, nothing is overridden. Numbers, 7 billion, is literally a speck of dust in the numbers we play with in the universal council. If you think you can manipulate a few hundred, a few thousand or a few million, you don’t even count as the number of the entities of life with a soul in the universe is even beyond your imagination. So we serve the order and we will carry out the order: it is the end of kingship and whatever you like to call yourselves as groups, the Illuminati’s, the Rothschilds, different groups, kings of different states that you call yourself murderers, and the abusers, the heads of states, you have finished your terms as of today and as of today there shall be no religion, no name of Judaism, no name of Islam, no name of Christianity as all have been in abuse for the benefit of you. Any man from today who calls himself a “Jew”, the exact word of that is nothing but what has been carried out, a murderer. You have taken the soul and abused it through the physicality. We gave you the knowledge and you abused it for physicality to gain knowledge. As of today there shall be no “Jews.” No one can terminate it, except me, who comes from the bloodline of Moses. And I ‘dished’ (? 18.43 minutes Livestream) what was his biggest fear.<br>凯史先生：你们一些人力图瘫痪这个场面，但是只要我在，你们什么也别想得逞！70亿人，70亿尘土，我们在宇宙委员会里面来玩游戏，如果你认为你能操纵几百人，几千人甚或几百万人，在宇宙中，灵性生命的数量你不需计算，多到不可思义。所以我们服务于秩序又实施秩序，那就是终结王权，你们愿意怎样称呼你们这个群体——光明会，罗斯柴尔德，不同的团伙，不同国家的王者，你自称为杀人犯，滥用者，国家首脑。今天你们的任期已经被终结了，而且从今天起，不会再有宗教，不再有犹太之名，不再有伊斯兰之名，不再有基督之名，因为你们都是为自己的利益施行滥用。从今天起，任何自称是“犹太”的人，不再存在这个词汇，已经被执行生效，杀人犯，你们一直操纵灵魂，通过身体滥用灵魂。我们给予你们知识，你们却滥用这些知识为肉身获得利益，就从今天起，抹去“犹太”这个词，除了我谁也不能恢复它。我来自摩西血统，我是<a href="31分">……</a> ，是他最大的恐惧！</p>
<p>K: So let’s see how the rest will play the game. We decide and we change and from today we change and we teach you everything that has been given to the governments over the past 6000 years. you will understand it that the tool I give you today and in the teachings for the next few days is the tool for the peace, it is the tool for union and for man to be equal with each other and not for the separation or to be ‘better.’ I will teach you how to create whatever you imagine. You will make it, not me.<br>凯史先生：所以，让我们看看其余的游戏怎样玩，从今天起我们决定改变，我们教你们所有知识，这些知识在6000多年前就给到政府手里了，今天你将会明白我给予你的工具，而且在接下来的几天的教学中，把和平的工具给你们，这些工具带来合一和平等，而不是造成分离和优越。我将教你们创造任何你想像得到的东西，你们要去制作，而不是我。</p>
<p>K: At the moment we have a pressing situation in our hand. I give my deepest condolences to the Chinese nation for those who have lost members and for millions who have been displaced. We have made commitment to the Chinese<br>凯史先生：此刻，我们需要处理一个急迫的状况。我向中国人致以最真心的慰问，向那些失去了的支持者以及数百万需要安置的人民。我们已经向中国许下了承诺。</p>
<p>Keshe Foundation and we carry out orders to help to bring the resCue pads and every possible way, partially of the teaching of today and partially helping in the background to deliver the technology as rapidly as possible through civil organizations of Chinese society to help in a way to alleviate some of the pain until we have delivered some of the knowledge directly to some of the Chinese organizations to work with us to speed up the process.<br>凯史基金会决定以任何可能的方式协助救援，通过中国社区民间组织以最快速的方式在后台交付技术，这样一方面可以减轻灾民的痛苦，直到我们与中国机构一道工作，加速直接交付知识的进程。</p>
<p>K: This is directly to those who are involved in Keshe Foundations in China and it is your responsibility to respond to your national need at this time. This makes you ready for what is to come in a short time and at least you have the first run and you understand. You have a massive flood (21.20 minutes livestream). We have taught this in the background to the people who work with us, to prepare and the funds have been made available for the resCue, but this is huge and you need to help Keshe Foundations in China. It is your responsibility to stop every way you are researching and to work in this direction until every man in China has received support with this flood. You have a massive flood. The flood has created contamination of water and soil， contaminated heavily beyond the use.<br>这也直接面向相关的中国凯史基金会的支持者们，这个时候，你们的责任是回报你们的国家。这就需要你们在短时间内准备好进行最初的运作和理解。你们发生特大洪水，我们在背景后面向那些与我们一起工作的人们进行教学，做好准备，已经准备了可用于救灾的资源，但这次灾难巨大，你需要中国凯史基金会的帮助，这是你的责任，停止你们各种搜寻的方式，朝这个方向上来工作，直到灾区的每个人都得到支持，你们遭遇了大洪灾，这次洪水造成了水污染，土地污染超过利用条件。</p>
<p>K: Go back to the reports and the teachings of the Keshe Foundation Ghana for the very simple process and produce as much as you can any of the 4 gans—copper oxide, zinc, CO2, and CH3 and you need the amino acid. The instruction is to make 100 ML if you can of all the gans in two bottles. In one bottle you put only CuO gans and you write clear instructions for people for what to do and that is on the receipt of the first bottle, they mix ….(interruption). You do not bother about anything else. You produce the CuO and CO2 (the green stuff or the brown stuff which is copper) and you put it in small jars. Any drinking bottle (plastic) is sufficient. You have masses of these and you don’t have to look for anything special. Put the CO2 with water in it and put a label on it on how to use it. If they take any contaminated water from anywhere they want to be, you only fill about 1/3 of a water bottle with the gans and you leave the rest to be filled up with plain water or just the gans. They can add the river water to it, or pure water to it, wherever they find it.<br>凯史先生：回到加纳凯史基金会的报告和教学，过程很简单，你尽可能生产4种甘斯——氧化铜CuO、锌Zinc、CO2和 CH3甘斯，以及你需要的氨基酸，这种用法要求准备你能制作的各种甘斯100ml，两个瓶子，一个瓶子只装CuO甘斯，在第一个瓶子上你给人们写上清理的说明和用法，搅拌成份和比例，其它你不需要考虑太多，你生产的CuO和CuO2，只要是铜不考虑这东西呈现绿色或褐色，把它们（CuO和CuO2）放在小一点的罐子里面。<br>任何普通饮料瓶子都够用，G`W3H{]SG{UYYDIFQ{BIZEH你收集这种就行，你不必专门找特别的，把CO2甘斯水放里面，把用法写在标签上贴在上面。如果他们想要处理那个地方的污染水，只需把甘斯装到瓶子的三分之一，其余部分你装干净水或只装甘斯（水），他们那边往里加河水或纯水，只要能找来的水都可以。</p>
<p>K: And add this water on top of the CuO gans, into the contaminated water of the river. It has to be IL per 100L of contaminated water. You need about a liter of the gans water that is above the contaminated water. (25.00 minutes). What you will see is the following: you all have seen the hundred liters will give you something like 10 liter of residue with clean drinking water.<br>然后，把这种CuO甘斯水的上层清水加入到取自河流的污染水里面，大约每100升污染水加1升CuO甘斯水（1/100），FV8[CG5K1@873]API8DCNM0就是这些的污染水你需要大约1升甘斯水，接下来你会看见什么呢？你们都看到这100升污染水给你大约10升某种残渣，以及清洁的饮用水。</p>
<p>These 90 liters is more or less (25.43 minutes) 10 liter plus 100 so then you can take the top or even 50% of the water on top and it is absolutely pure and you can drink it. Any germs, bacteria or sediment is out of the water. Make sure that you use Copper oxide, CuO2, and it is the only one at the moment that can give you the energy to transfer and clean the water out. These 50 liters is usable, drinking water, with no contamination or salts.<br>另外90升左右的水，100升里面这下面10升沉淀的残渣，剩下上面的这些，你能取出其上部多达50%的部分绝对是纯水，你可以饮用，任何细菌和沉淀物都分离了，确信你用的氧化铜（CuO）和氧化亚铜（CuO2）,%)UR0[VXX0WI7CX2EZEX1NY这种情况下，这是唯一能转换和清洁水源的能量。这50升水可以饮用，没有污染也没有盐份。</p>
<p>K: now take a second bottle and what you need to add is CO2 plus CH3 plus Zinc oxide plus COHN (amino acids that give totality). CO2 is still decontamination but if there is any residue left in the water you need a liter of the CO2 mixture with a half liter of the clean water. Take from the clean water and a half liter of it to mixture and you get yourself water that comes out. You never use and when you write the manual, they NEVER touch the residue. only play with the water. The CO2 will give you establishment of part of the energy you need, the CH3 will cover you for most of the energy you need and the Zinc is needed in these conditions because most of the people get emotionally disturbed in these conditions (flood aftermath) and the disturbance continues for years. But adding the Zinc oxide brings stability to the emotion and they can think correctly. And so you feed the physicality and you feed the emotion. You will find people will not behave out of order and they find solution and peace in themselves for the condition they are in. You add amino acid so that this connects with their bodies.<br>现在，第二个瓶子，你需要加入CO2+CH3+氧化锌（ZnO）+COHN（氨基酸）。CO2继续清理水里面任何残留的污染，需要按1升的（CO2+CH3+ZnO+COHN）的混合物配0.5升清洁水，取来0.5升清洁水加入CO2混合甘斯水，你就可以从中得到你自己的洁净水[_1NMUESXQR(3(84M1A7FNP。你不要，如果你写操作手册，永远不要接触残留物，只与水打交道。CO2将给你提供一部分所需的能量，CH3将覆盖你需要的大部分能量，这种情况下需要锌（ZnO），因为大部分群众在洪灾之后情感扰动很厉害，这种扰动甚至可以持续数年，加入氧化锌（ZnO）就可以平息情感扰动，使他们能够正确思维。所以，你喂养物理身体同时也喂养情感，你将发现人们的表现不会逾越法则，他们会找到解决方案，他们把他们自己带到和平的条件下。你加入氨基酸（COHN），就连接他们的身体。</p>
<p>K: with infections or damages, anything on their skin including Cuts and bruises, deep Cuts, certain procedures, write the manual very simply. In the case of infection on the skin or the Cuts they again use the Gans water, the plasma of CuO plus CO2 and this gets rid of most infections that are on the skin. If there is a deep Cut or a need for internal conditions such as damage to the organs or whatever, below the neck you go 50/50 with the CuO and the CO2. With very deep Cuts you change the composition to CuO2, plus CO2 plus Zinc oxide plus amino acid (COHN). Because it is physical the ratio is 5CuO2, 3CO2, 1ZNo, and 1 amino acid (COHN). This is needed and you do the repair in the muscle tissue. You do the connection and communication for the repair and each tissue is not only physical, it has the Zinc which is the emotion. That is where that finger sign (he talked about at the beginning of the workshop) came from; it is the physicality of the emotion (the pointer finger and pinkie finger are up sign and the others are down.) The stupid presidents use it without understanding it. You have been called a clown for long enough. So if you make 5 drops, 3 drops, 1 drop and 1 drop you speed up the process of the healing of the tissue muscles.<br>凯史先生：感染或受伤，任何皮肤上的切口、擦伤和深度伤口，必须的程序，编写进手册，很简单。皮肤感染和受伤的情况下，他们再次用到甘斯水，CuO等离子体加上CO2，就能使皮肤摆脱大多数感染。如果有深度受伤或内部器官严重受损，在脖子以下，你按50/50TXDZ3Y{@NW}1@T[$Q0F(MEF用CuO和CO2。如果很深很深的损伤，你要改变成分为CuO2+ CO2 +ZnO+氨基酸（COHN），因为身体的组成比例是5CuO2+ 3CO2+ 1ZnO+1 氨基酸（COHN）D5$B{7WCF$$MA]8DZ~@GGEI，需要这些（CuO2）成分来修复你的肌肉组织，这些（CO2）与每个组织进行联系和交流，不仅修复身体，还用锌（ZnO）来修复情感。这个手指信号RVXNOW%G9C2N)<code>Z</code>)0%CZ~R（他谈到教学开始），它的物理部分来自它的情感，（表示食指和小指是上升，其它手指是下降）。那位蠢蛋总统使用它但你没有理解它，你被称为小丑的时间足够长了。所以如果你使用5滴CuO2+ 3滴CO2+ 1滴ZnO+1 滴氨基酸（COHN），你就加速肌肉组织愈合的过程。</p>
<p>skin that when it breaks it creates inflammation that brings the lymph to support and calcium for the emergency. So, if you have a broken bone you can instruct it simple or add a small bit of CaO and mix this water of calcium oxide and if there is heavy damage you make a mixture and reduce the CO2, copper oxide, CH3, amino acid (COHN) and you use calcium oxide. In the Chinese community you know what is there for the calcium to bring and you can bring it very quickly. You can bring it from the ashes of the bone and if you burn the bone you can collect it very quickly. Here the combination is 2 drops CO2, 3 to 4 drops CuO2, 1 drop CaO, 1 drop CH3, and 1 drop NoCH (amino acids). Here you are treating the muscle tissue and the bone tissue at the same time for rapid repair.<br>当皮肤受到创伤，形成炎症，淋巴和钙就会应急支持。如果你有骨折，可以简单指导人们把少量的氧化钙（CaO）添加进甘斯混合物里面，如果是严重创伤，在你的混合物中减少CO2、CuO、CH3和氨基酸（COHN），并且使用CaO。在华人社区，你们知道什么方式可以很快弄到钙，你可以烧骨头，从骨头灰里面可以很快收集到钙。这里的组合是2滴CO2、3 - 4滴CuO2、1-2滴CaO2、1滴CH3、1滴氨基酸（COHN）JNUZ%{3[B1M2_0B{C83]F7I。这样来让你的肌肉组织和骨组织同时快速修复。</p>
<p>K: in the cases of head injury where you have citizens with head injury and brain damage the condition changes totally. Again you make the same thing: CO2 plus CaO (calcium oxide) plus Zno (zinc oxide). These are in the case of brain injury. From the beginning when you produce it give them 4 bottles and add the amino acid of the water you created into the bottle and the condition is perfect. In the brain injury conditions you do 3 drops CO2 plus 3 droops CaO2 plus 4 drops of Zno. You need the Calcium oxide because the brain cells establish themselves from the calcium of the skull and without it you cannot have a brain cell. It is important. So look at the injuries and this is what you need to do.<br>头部受伤的情况下，如果你们有公民有头部和大脑受伤，整个条件完全改变了，同样你做的事情：CO2+ CaO2+ZnO，这是用在脑损伤的情况下。在开始生产[甘斯]的时候，把氨基酸[甘斯]水添加进那4种甘斯瓶里，创建出这样条件就很完美。在脑损伤的情况下，你需要3滴CO2+ 3滴CaO2+4滴ZnO，7QISMGHIJ7AJFNF00[A]RU5你需要氧化钙（CaO）,因为大脑细胞建立要从自己的头骨取出钙来使用，没有它（CaO）不能重建大脑细胞。这很重要，所以你要看是什么样的伤情，这些是你必需要做的。</p>
<p>第二部分笔译——阿基里斯</p>
<p>K: in the coming time based on teachings of today, we bring different sections of the Keshe Foundation who have been working in the background to show you the new way of technology development that you have been waiting for that you can use in transportation, transmutation and production of energy to deliver these directly locally. But you have to make the systems. So, we recap. Try to make the gans of CO2, ZnO, CH3, and CaO2 (calcium) and every time you make the gans collect a little amino acid on the top. Just take the tip to collect some and add the amino acids to the water. It will absorb and become part of it. Your gans is collected at the bottom and when you collect it you put it in the bottle. Add a tip in to the gans and amino acid of the same. You need these to connect to the injury they need to be repairing</p>
<p>凯史先生：在接下来的日子，基于今天的教学我们将推出不同的凯史基金会研发部门，他们负责在幕后进行各种你们期待已久的新科技的研发工作，包括远程传输、（物质）转化和能源生成。但是你们必须自己制作这些系统。尝试制作各种甘斯，CO2、ZnO、CH3和CaO2（氧化钙），每次收集甘斯的时候顺便收集一些顶层的氨基酸。每次收集一丁点就好了，并把它放到水里。水会吸收它并将其变成自身的一部分。甘斯则从（盒子）底部收集，收集后放倒瓶子里。同时放入一点同一种甘斯的氨基酸进去。你需要它们来连接伤口并进行修复。</p>
<p>K: so, what you do is you have seen the combinations. Heavy cuts, you use the CUO with CO2 and add the emotion ZnO for the linkage, and the ratios are very clear. If you have brain injury, bone injury you will get rapid growth and rapid change. There is in the condition you want to take further which is the backbone of the Oasis system as you know up today. Today we change the course of humanity. We open the transportation equal to the transportation systems of the universal community today. We carry on tomorrow or Monday or Tuesday until the like the Magrav systems you create your first flight systems.</p>
<p>凯史先生：因此，你要使用（甘斯）组合。严重的破口伤你使用CuO和CO2，并加入ZnO进行情感的连接，它们的比例是很清楚的。如果你是大脑受伤，骨头受伤，你将获得快速的生长和快速的转变。有一种情况你需要应用今天我们讲到的绿洲系统的骨干。今天我们改变了人类的进程。今天我们公开了与宇宙中的传输系统相同的传输系统。我们会在明天或周一或周二继续，直到你们像制作能量单元一样能制作飞行系统。</p>
<p>K: Today we called it a blue print for space and if you listen you understand and you will find out how you will be detached from the material estate and how you make systems which have no matter and you start working the way those who came here to teach man about the universal community but got entangled with the beauty of the women and the wealth of the land. And they changed their habits from being the man of the universe and they became the criminals of the planet. So we have sent them back. Earth from now on will receive knowledge directly from the hand of the Creator. The time of torture is over.</p>
<p>凯史先生：今天我们称其为太空（飞船）的蓝图，如果你们在听你们就会理解，你们将发现如何使你们脱离物质状态的方法，如何制作没有物质的系统，你们将开始与来自宇宙并教会我们这些知识的人使用同样的工作方式（科技），但是他们留恋于女色和这大好河山，因此他们改变了他们的习性，从宇宙的人类变成了这颗星球上的动物。因此我们要把他们送回去。从现在开始，地球将直接从造物主的手中接收知识。苦难的时代结束了！</p>
<p>K: if you want to understand how to make systems which work according to the work of the universe you have to understand the work of the universe in its true essence. In some positions you have already known and you have seen and somehow the confidence of being intelligent beings has been taken from you by those who pretended and brought the intelligence for those who wanted to abuse. To understand the work of the universe look at the universe. The picture is here and you can see it easily…open soup of plasma fields, open soup of magnetic and gravitational fields and open soup of the universe. Let’s look; I tried to explain the knowledge in the way that you understand and I have explained this knowledge in several ways to 2 or 3 groups around the Keshe Foundation and around the world so that if anything happens they carry part of the message and the man could put it together themselves.</p>
<p>凯史先生：如果你们想制造按照宇宙原理运行的系统，你们必须理解真正的宇宙规律。其实有的时候你们已经知道了，但是你们还是需要看到（证据），因为你们的自信已经被那些想奴役我们的人夺走了。全景图就在这，你们可以很容易的看到它……打开等离子场体汤，打开磁场和引力场的汤，那就打开了宇宙的汤。让我们瞧瞧；我试图用你们理解的方式来教你们，我用各种不同的方式来教凯史基金会和世界各地的2到3个小组，因此如果有什么事情发生了的话，人们可以自己把这些知识拼凑出来。</p>
<p>K: we were expecting collateral damage last Weds or Thurs and the man who made the decision to make the collateral damage in the house is supposed to be white and he turned out to be very black. The same woman in the position of power where I was imprisoned for 11 days in Canada had her hand in it. So unfortunately we shall see no president as a woman. The reality is that you look in the atmosphere in the universe. This is, if you look at it the universe. (41.29 minutes). I explain this in a very fine way to our team that they could understand it and a lot of you can relate to it. The universe has a center line where it shot out of another and will carry on the work (41.55 minutes). So, the earth, the sun, the center plasma of the electron or the proton, the center of the universe have the center line and this line dictates the direction of the motion of the entity. In this line somewhere there is a large concentration of high power and these high power fields in rotation bring fields in and to feed out.</p>
<p>凯史先生：上周三或周四我们本来会受到连带伤害的，住在那个“宫”里并做出这个伤害的人，这个“宫”本来应该是白的，结果被搞得很黑。处在同样地位的那个女人，害我在加拿大遭受了11天的冤狱，她亲手操办的。因此，很不幸，我们将不会看到一个女人当总统。真相就是，当你看着太空中的大气层。也就是，如果你看着宇宙（41.29分钟）。我向我们的小组很好的解释了这个，他们能够理解，你们当中的很多人都会涉及它。宇宙有一根中心线，它会射出另一根，并且会持续（41.55分钟）。因此，地球、太阳、电子或质子的中心等离子体，宇宙的中心都有中心线，这根线决定了实体的运动方向。在这根线的某处有高浓度的能量，这个高能量场的旋转造成的场体的输入和输出。</p>
<p>K: it was this moment where these massive amount of fields that are in motion at some points of different strength will interact and the interaction of the two fields (42.59 minutes) will lead depending on the quantity, the strength and the size of the entity to creation of the universes, then the creation of the galaxies, the creation of the solar systems, then the planets, then the moons, then the atomic structure, then matter state and everything else. This applies to all of it. You are man of matter state and physicality and if you want to see the work of the universe, I explained this to the team so that they could understand.</p>
<p>凯史先生：就在这个时候，这些大量的运动中的场体在某些点上的不同场强将引起两个场体的交互，根据数量、强度和实体的大小会产生出宇宙，然后会产生出星系、产生出太阳系，然后产生行星，产生月亮，产生原子结构，以及物质状态和其它所有东西。它们全都是这个原理。你们就是处于物质态和肉体中的人，如果你们想知道宇宙的运行机制，我向团队解释了这个原理，他们能够理解。</p>
<p>K: You know what cotton candy is? It is a fluffy candy you buy on a stick at the fair that they roll it and it becomes a sugar. This is exactly the work of the universe. The center of the sugar (44.21 minutes) and the speed of the rotation of spreading the sugar open and then the webs of the cotton candy machine spread like a spider web. It is nothing, but everything and it has no entity until you put a stick in it. Then it becomes the center point of the interaction and the creation. Then you rule it and you pad it up. If you understand this and the process of the creation of any entity of the universe where at one point the fields become strong enough to solidify to become an entity and this becomes the center, be it the universe, the galaxy or whatever else and in our teachings we call this center the wood which you put in the center space of the cotton candy machine, the principle matter. Now it dictates and builds. Go back to the knowledge of man and how you can make this cotton candy stick and bring the cotton candy to it. Now if you understand it, then it becomes very easy and you choose how big the candy becomes and by the bigness how close and where you want to be and in what color and shape.</p>
<p>凯史先生：你们知道棉花糖吗？它是一种很蓬松的糖，粘在一根棍子上，你们在集贸市场可以买到，他们把它卷出来，就变成了一种糖。这就是宇宙的运行方式。糖的中心，通过旋转速度进行扩散，糖被打开了，然后棉花糖机就把它展开来，像蜘蛛网一样。它什么都不是，又什么都是，它没有实体直到你把棍子伸进去。然后，它（棍子）就变成了交互作用和创造的中心点。然后你就可以控制它，把它填满。如果你理解这个，宇宙中任何实体的创造都是在某个点上，场体强大到足以固化成实体，然后它就变成了中心，就变成了宇宙，银河系或者任何东西。在我们的教学中，我们就把这个中心成为伸进棉花糖机的木棍，主源物质。然后它就进行控制和创造。回想一下棉花糖是怎么做出来的。现在，如果你理解了的话，你就可以很容易的控制棉花糖的大小，你知道该怎么改变它的大小，应该使用多远的距离，如何改变它的颜色和形状。</p>
<p>K: if this has been hard for you I had to go through this process. I had to go through the process of the materialistic man and I have said many times to create the nano-material, the gans, the plasma, the liquid plasma and actually the liquid plasma for you now is the liquid inside the center of the cotton candy. Then I mixed everything the way I just taught you –copper oxide, zinc oxide—and everything is in one level and then you start rotating it but you could not fix it. Now we show you how from the matter state to go to the nano state to go to the gans state, to go to the liquid plasma to the fields, and now we show you how you make the fields.</p>
<p>凯史先生：如果这样你们还是理解不了，我就只能用这个方式解释了。我只能用你们这些唯物主义的人的方式了。我说了无数次，你们要制作纳米材料，甘斯，等离子，液态等离子，然后液态等离子就相当于棉花糖中心的液体了。然后我把所有的东西拌在一起，我告诉你们氧化铜、氧化锌和所有处于同一层次的东西，然后你们开始旋转它，但是你们还是搞不定。现在我们想你们展示了如何从物质态进入纳米态，进入甘斯态，进入液态等离子的场体，然后现在告诉你们如何制造场体。</p>
<p>K: go back on the history of the man and look at how for centuries man looked how to make a dome. One of the biggest achievements of the man was to learn how to make a dome. There are different stories of how different cultures came to build it. But an essential way if you look at it, when you wanted to make the dome you needed a scaffolding. Some made the scaffolding of the hay and made it the shape of the dome and built the dome, and then they took scaffolding away and what they had left was the dome they wanted. I tried to teach you how to make the scaffolding and now I teach you how to make the dome, your spaceship. You have to build a structure where you can support it and once you build it the structure is there without the material state. So you have done all of it; you have built the gans, the gans water, the fields,  balls and you saw the emptiness of the field inside the ball. You have to add your gans water and you had your gans. (50.11 minutes)</p>
<p>凯史先生：回顾人类的历史，看看几个世纪以来人们是如何建造圆顶的。人类最大的成就之一就是学会了如何制造圆顶。不同的文明有不同的方法建造。但是，如果你观察一下就会发现，无论哪种方法关键都是你要用到脚手架。有的使用干草作为脚手架，把它做成原定的形状，然后在上面建造圆顶，建好后再把这些脚手架撤掉。我尝试教你们如何创建一个你们可以支撑起来的结构，一旦你创建出来，那个结构就在那里而不需要任何物质状态。所以你已经完成了它的全部；你制作了甘斯，甘斯水，场体，球，你们看到了球中心的空洞。你必须加入你的甘斯水，而你也有甘斯水。</p>
<p>K: The only thing you have a problem with is how to get the ball to rotate and to use the energy of it that whatever is in the ball can now exist without the rest. (49.13 minutes). And if you manage to do this you will understand something. It is you who is going to decide what this is going to be. Is it the center line, the energy independent of any entity like the universe? You want energy, motion, matter or whatever, now you have the energy of the universe in your hands. This has been your problem; energy not from what you see but energy from you what you feel and you understand the energy of. I had to play every trick in the universe to get you children of the man to understand it and all the time it was your habit to look the other way. Now I put you on the pin and you have to understand it because you have no choice. Because now we have dismissed your bosses who have abused you so you have no choice but to do it yourself. There are no leaders as in space and you cannot come to earth and say, what is the decision now, sir? You, sir, is now yourself as ‘sir.’ You have to decide as the last man standing.</p>
<p>凯史先生：你们唯一的问题是如何让球转起来，如何利用它的能量，现在球里的东西已经可以独立存在了。如果你这么做的话，你会理解一些东西。决定它成为什么的人是你。它是中心线吗？是类似宇宙的独立于任何实体的能量吗？你想要得到能量、运动、物质或随便什么，现在你手中拥有了宇宙的能量。这就是你的问题所在；这些能量你看不见，但是你能感觉到，你能理解。我不得不使用所有的技巧来让你们这些人类小孩理解它，而你们总是习惯于用另外的方法去理解。现在我把你们放在大头针上，你们不得不理解，因为你们没得选择。因为现在我们赶走了奴役你们的老板，你们没有选择只能自己实现。太空中没有领导人，你不能跑到地球然后说，先生，你决定好了吗？你现在就是“先生”。你必须像最后（剩下）的人类那样抉择。</p>
<p>K: we give you the pen, the plasma, the gans, you sprayed it, you drank it, you saw the difference and now you understand it is there and you have to understand how to make it. It is there and you don’t need to contain it. You don’t need to contain it! This, if you understand, you have reached the knowledge of the most advanced cultures in the universal community. As I said, when I take man to the space I will not take him as a subordinate but as an equal. To be equal you have to understand from the top. You have to understand what we tried to build, God knows, 6000 years ago; we repeated it again and we had done it some years before that. A few kept it to themselves and they abused it. Now you all learn how to control this energy and then build, make and have whatever you need from it.</p>
<p>凯史先生：我们给你健康笔、等离子、甘斯，你喷它，你喝它，你看到了不同，现在你相信它就在那，你必须理解如何制作它。它在那，而你也不需要把它装起来。你不需要把它装起来！如果你理解这一点的话，你就接近了宇宙中最先进的文明的知识。正如我所说的，当我将人类带入太空，我不会让阶级存在，人人都是平等的。要想平等你必须从上层开始理解。你必须理解我们想要建造的是什么，上帝知道，6000年前。我们现在重复它，重复我们多年前所做过的事情。一小撮人把这些知识据为己有。现在你们都学会了控制这个能量并建造，从中制造任何你需要的东西。</p>
<p>K: your problem was how to create this energy; your problem was how to contain it and then when you contained it what about there is no dimension in the matter state. I said in many of my teachings, the beauty of working on this planet, even in the tapes we play at the beginning of it, why don’t people even listen to this message? All the message is in that tape. We gave you the matter so you can create and control the plasma and the production of the nano and the gans and they are all interconnected and at the same time so strong that one day you will understand it. Let’s build a spaceship or at least a universal system that this thing becomes your sun. It is you who decides if you make Jupiter, the Earth, Mars and/or the life and whichever material is in this universe.</p>
<p>凯史先生：你们的问题就是如何制造这个能量；你们的问题就是如何把这能量装起来，然后当你们把它装起来的时候，那里没有维度是处于物质状态的。我在教学中说过多次了，这颗行星的运行原理，就算是听磁带我们也得从头开始听吧，为什么人们就不能好好倾听这条信息呢？所有的信息都在这个磁带上。我给了你们物质因而你们可以创造并控制等离子，纳米的生成，甘斯，他们都是相互连接的，同时连接的，非常的强大，总有一天你们会明白的。让我们建造一个太空飞船或者至少建造一个宇宙系统，这个东西变成你的太阳。然后你就是那个决定在这个宇宙中如何制造木星、地球、火星、生命或者任意物质的人。</p>
<p>K: let’s go back to the basics so we all start the same. We started with a simple copper wire and in that copper wire we nano coating we created the gans. In creating the gans we saw the energy of it. Now we know the energy is somewhere in there so how can we capture and tame it? then we understand the work of our own emotion and our own soul is the same as that pink bit in the center that is there without physicality and it controls your physicality so if you can make one of these (53.48 minutes) in the system and you already have one of these within the structure of your brain, soul and emotion then you can see how you decide the interaction. I want to be; I want to have water. The energy of the water will be part of it and I don’t need to drink it. Where are you going to find water in the middle of deep space? Do you want to come back to earth to keep on drinking or understand that when the water enters the body of the man, I have told you many times that it become the field condition of the gans and this water now behaves as a plasma and when it goes in your stomach it transfers its energy through as a plasma. And not as water; then when it comes to its destination in the lymph adds to the positioning or water as you call it, then it becomes a bone, muscle tissue or it stays in liquid if the gaps are too far.</p>
<p>凯史先生：让我们回到最基础的地方，那样我们就可以在同一起跑线了。我们从一段铜线，然后给它涂层，然后我们制造了甘斯。在制造甘斯的过程中，我们看到了它的能量。现在我们知道能量就在那里，那么我们怎么捕捉并驯服它呢？然后我们明白了我们自己的情感和灵魂的工作方式，就跟在中心的那个粉红的点一样，那里没有肉体，但是它控制着你的肉体，因此如果你能在系统中制造他们其中一个的话，你早就在你的大脑、灵魂和情感结构中拥有其中一个了，然后你就可以看到你如何决定这个交互。我想要这样；我想要水。谁的能量就会变为其中一部分，然而我并不需要去喝它。你在太空深处上哪去找水？你是想再跑回地球继续喝水，还是想弄清楚水是如何进入人体的？我已经告诉你们很多次了，水会变成甘斯态的场体条件，它的行为就像一个等离子体，当它到达你的胃里，它会作为等离子体传输它的能量。而不是作为水。然后当它到达经过淋巴定位的目的地，它就会变成骨头、肌肉组织或者如果间隙太大的话它继续保持液体状态。</p>
<p>K: That is all you need to know and that is that in the distance the closer it is the harder it is and it is the bone. The further distance becomes muscle tissue and even further distance becomes your lymph and the liquid of the body. Now you understand that it is how you position yourself and how you absorb energy from the environment and how you don’t need to carry with you. But if the body of the man needs water for the confirmation of his existence then you produce and receive energy the same as crossing the stomach and it crosses the body of the man and becomes the liquid of the body of the man. This is in all my teachings. We take 80% of our energy from our environment and because we are physical we take 20% to confirm that we exist. Now you understand the process.</p>
<p>凯史先生：这就是你所需要知道的一切，距离越近它就越硬，它就是骨头。更远的距离就变成肌肉组织，再远就是淋巴和体内的液体。现在你明白了，这就是你如何定位自身的，如何从环境中吸收能量的，为何你不需要携带（食物和水）的。但是，如果人体需要水来确认它自身的存在，那么你可以造水，通过胃接收能量，然后它穿越人体并成为人体内的液体。这就是我全部的教学。我们从环境中吸收80%的能量，而且因为我们是物质的，我们吸收剩余的20%来确认我们的存在。现在你们应该明白了这整个过程。</p>
<p>K: you have to create a condition for anything you need and in the interaction with what you think which is non-dimensional because you don’t have a container that your thoughts are in or your emotions are in, but they are free fields of interaction that give you strength and then you understand that you have entered the world of the universal community in the interaction, motion, communication and everything else. So the problem is how do we make the scaffolding that can give us the dome? How do we make a structure that gives us the free plasma that we know where it is and we have control of it and then we can play the game of the gods? We came down to nano-materials and the gans of the plasma.</p>
<p>凯史先生：你必须为你需要的东西制造一个条件，在交互过程中你所想的是无维度的，因为你没有一个容器，你的想法在你体内的情感中，但是他们是自由的交互场体，它给了你力量，然后你就明白了你通过交互、运动、通讯等新技术进入了宇宙大家庭的世界。因此问题是我们怎样制造用于建造圆顶的脚手架呢？我们如何能制造出给我们自由等离子体的结构呢，我们知道它存在，我们能控制它，然后我们就可以造黄金玩了。现在我们归结为纳米材料和等离子体的甘斯。</p>
<p>K: now, a lot of you by now should have found how to do it and somehow it did not click and work for a lot of you because you are too materialistic and you are looking for things which are not actually there and you have been told if you can’t see then don’t believe it, or show me so I can believe it. That is how they control you. So, I show you the magic in how to believe and what to believe in. You will see and the Keshe Foundation team will show you everything piece by piece. It was all in front of you.</p>
<p>凯史先生：到目前为止，很多人都已经知道如何制作它（甘斯），但是不知为什么你们发现它都不怎么管用，因为你们太物质化思维了，你们在寻找实际并不存在的东西，你们都信奉眼见为实。这就是他们如何控制你们的。因此，我展示教你们如何相信它（的存在）的魔法。你们会看到凯史基金会的团队一样一样的展示给你们。它全在你们面前。</p>
<p>K: We have the pleasure of having Dr. Klaus with us; he came all the way to bring materials to save the life of the girl he has never met (Naomi, Fabio’s wife) but the life is precious to him. Thank you for coming. This is what the presidents don’t understand. Their lives are worthless and they make the decisions to take lives because they think they have the power. We have taken that away from you because you are not even worth being on this planet.</p>
<p>凯史先生：我们很高兴Klaus医生能跟我们在一起。他用了各种材料来挽救那个他从未谋面的女孩的生命（Naomi，Fabio的妻子）。感谢你的到来。这就是那些总统们所不能理解的。他们草菅人命，他们作出的决定夺走了成千上万的生命，因为他们认为他们有那个权力。我们会剥夺你们的权力，因为你们甚至没资格呆在这颗行星上。</p>
<p>K: What you need to do is now we make the scaffolding and this is part of the structure of making the scaffolding. (58.29 minutes). You get yourself a large clear plastic box. In this scaffolding you add all the gans waters you have ever created; fill it up to a limit that you will understand in the time to come. Add some of the gans at the bottom of it and the gans at the bottom is the central line of the universe so that the continuous energy is released. So work with the box with the mixture of the water. But in fact if you look at it, by leaving some gans material at the bottom you create that center line (see drawing 59.17 minutes) and energy is continuous fed. You put the liquid plasma from the waters you made on the top and let it settle. The energy is forward upcoming continuously inside. This is your, in a way your sugar and your cotton candy.</p>
<p>凯史先生：你们现在需要做的事情就是制作用于建造脚手架的脚手架。你们给自己搞来了一个大的塑料盒子。在这个脚手架中，你加入你制作出来的甘斯水；填满它，等时机成熟了你们就明白了。在底部加入一些它的甘斯，底部的甘斯就是宇宙的中心线，那里持续的能量就会被释放。因此（你们要）使用装着（甘斯）水的混合的盒子来工作。但是如果你仔细观察，通过在底部放入一些甘斯，你创造了中心线，能量被持续的供给。你放入在顶部制作出来的液态等离子体，并让它沉淀。能量将会从内部持续涌现出来。这就是你的糖和你的棉花糖。</p>
<p>K: Now you have to collect it and make the scaffolding to be able to bring it together. In my teachings I have taught you everything and again, as children, you are too passive. When you added your gans into your systems, and we have all the gans we have collected in this place. Put your gans and let it settle and then you add the water of the gans. Now this water has become the plasma and you have seen it. You take the water and spray it on your skin and the pain is gone and the field is inside of it. Now you have the universal condition and now it is you who decides: do you want to be a galaxy, a star or do you want to be a planet? What and how you stick your pen in, how close you stick your pen in and how fast you turn the spin. In our teaching we showed you the spin and you all missed it. Do you remember these little cores and how we brought this in? These half coils which you made, you filled them with the gans and you made the balls of it and you did everything you wanted.</p>
<p>凯史先生：现在你必须收集它，然后制作出最后的脚手架。在教学中我反复的教你们，像教小孩那样教，你们太被动了。当你加入甘斯到你的系统，我们在这里有你们收集的所有甘斯。放入你们的甘斯，让它沉淀，然后加入甘斯水。现在这个水就变成了等离子体，你们已经见识过。你们取出这些水，喷到皮肤上，疼痛就消失了，场体就在它里面。现在你们拥有了宇宙的条件，轮到你们自己决定了：你是想要一个银河系？一颗星星还是一个地球？你如何放入你的健康笔？你将健康笔放多近？你选择多快的转速？在教学中，我们展示了旋转，而你们都没注意。你们还记得这些小的内核吗？我们是怎么介绍的？这些你们制作的半个线圈，你们给它加入甘斯，你们将它们制作成球，你们已经做了你们想要的一切。</p>
<p>K: the center of this does not need any gans if you place it in here (the center line drawing see 1.01.35 minutes) and according to the strength you absorb becomes the center. How was it contained? It is you have to start stirring and condition it so you can control it. In that process very simply more or less what you have to do is add the next ingredient…your stick. When you have the stick, now the stick is empty but in rotating if you remember the plasma balls where you had the ball and the gans water (1.02.18 minutes) you have the free energy, free plasmatic gravitational. You have a plasmatic field and you have to make two of them because we learned that when you make two part of the fields interact and part of the fields repel, so you need to create two of them. Then part of the field in the same direction and the same speed as the opposite creates both the magnetic and the gravitational. In that process now you sustain the dynamic plasma because in trying to catch up, trying to absorb and trying to give the energies of the lower order to receive the higher order, you create the turbulence, the motion. 1.03.32</p>
<p>凯史先生：它的中心不需要任何甘斯，如果你把它放在这里（画了条中心线）根据 你吸收的场强变成了中心。如何将它装起来？你必须创建好初始条件，那样你才能控制它。这个过程中很简单，你多少需要加入一些下一种原材料……你的棍子（棉花糖棍子）。当你又了棍子，现在这个棍子是空的，但是它在旋转，如果你们记得那个等离子体球，那个球和甘斯水，你就拥有了自由能源，自由等离子体重力场。你有一个等离子场体，你需要制作两个这样的，因为我们知道当你制造了两个场体的交互，一部分的场体会排斥，因此你需要制造两个场体。然后在同一方向、同一速度的的部分场体的对立场体就会同时制造出磁力场和引力场。在这个过程中，你们认同了动态等离子体，因为通过尝试纠缠，尝试吸收，尝试给予能量给较弱的，你们创造出了漩涡和运动。</p>
<p>K: But now you have this and you have to contain it. In containing it you decide very much going back to wherever you started, how and what you want to do. (1.03.56 minutes). You see now that this is your core for you to be able to decide for the time being, we have to give you the rings; they are another part of the ingredients in your box and they are cumbersome. As you see it is your Magrav system and if you look at it, it’s the coils and they decide and now you have the fields of the plasma through it. Then you start again and this is what you are supposed to do. So now, according to what you put in or across will dictate the creation; now you carry both gravitational magnetical condition of the flow (the two coils at 90 degrees to each other) and out of nowhere you create what to you is a ‘black hole’ and what to me is principal matter in the centers of these cores without any material but with all the powers and energy of the universe. Now you have created structure which carries huge amounts of energy and now you have to take the scaffolding off.</p>
<p>凯史先生：但是现在你们有了它，你们必须把它装起来。通过将它装起来，你们决定了很多。回到你们开始的地方，你们想要做的是什么。你们现在看到了这就是你们的内核，你们用它可以决定那一时刻的到来，我们必须给你那个铃声。它们是你盒子中的另外一部分原材料，而它们很笨重。他就是你们的能量单元系统，如果你们仔细观察的话，起决定作用的是线圈，而现在你们通过它拥有了等离子场体。然后你们又重新开始了，这就是你们应该做的。因此现在，根据你放入的东西将决定创造的结果；现在你们同时有了重力场和磁力场的流动环境（两个线圈呈90度）你们创造出来的东西对于你们来说就是一个“黑洞”，而对于我来说就是位于这些内核中心的没有任何物质的主源，它具有宇宙的全部能量。现在你们创造了带有巨大能量的结构，现在你们必须拿走脚手架了。</p>
<p>K: it is very easy. Once you start the rotation, empty your container. That is all you need do— nothing else. Because once you empty it, the fields are still all together and you have the center. Then the center decides on it according to connection with your emotion what you create—a massive gravitational/magnetic field force that you control through your emotion. You do this everyday in your life: I want to control my arm; I want to move my leg. Where do you think this comes from? It’s a remote control to the transmitter of energy. Now all you need to do if you are very clever you even take the cores away and then you have a container of energy. It’s very simple. The biggest mystery of the universe is solved in one go. But the more expert you get at it, the more you know how to control it and then you see it can be added. You grow the matter, you created the entities, you added with what you have and created the plasma field and you contain the plasma field on the speed that comes with its own rotation and the rest is the ‘son that is free of the mother.’ It still receives the energy or gives what it needs. You can keep the condition of the liquid until you get comfort in the way you did it. If you tap into what comes out or what goes in, you will have your meager electric current if you put matter to it. If you understand this process you can connect to anywhere in the universe. That is how simple it has been and our messengers got attracted to body of the woman on this planet turned everything upside down.</p>
<p>凯史先生：这很简单。一旦你开始了旋转，就清空你的容器。这就是需要做的全部——没有其他了。因为一旦你清空了它，场体仍然在一起，然后你就拥有了中心。然后这个中心根据你的情感来作出决定，一个你可以通过你情感进行控制的巨大的磁引力场场体力量。你每天都在做这些事情：我想控制我的胳膊；我想移动我的腿。你认为这些都来自哪里？这些都是来自那个能量发射机的远程控制。现在如果你很聪明的话，你需要做的事情就是你取出内核，然后你就有了一个装着能量的容器。这很简单。宇宙中最大的奥秘就这么一下子被解决了。你越是深入了解它，你就越知道如何去控制它，你就知道如何去扩展它。你们增加了物质，你们创造了尸体，你们添加进去你们有的所有东西，并创造出了等离子场体，你们将等离子场体放在容器中，它保持着它自身的旋转，然后你们就有了这个“儿子”，它的母亲得到了解放。它仍然在接受能量或者给出它所需的。你可以保持液体的这个环境，直到你适应了你对它所做的事情。如果你们深入了解出来的是什么，进去的又是什么，你们将会得到你们能量单元的电流，如果你把物质放进去。如果你理解这个过程，你可以从宇宙中任何地方与它连接。它就是这么简单，而我们的（宇宙）乘客们沉迷于这颗星球上女人的肉体，因而他们颠倒了黑白。</p>
<p>第三部分笔译——郑泉</p>
<p>[01:20:26]-[01:23:14]<br>K: we came to see how it is and why physicality makes such a change. You can all go home; you did not deliver correctly. You stand in space when you go back. Renen ,are you in the background? Or Jonathan or Bernie? Douglas you have the physical system with you in the states. The beauty of this is that we have done this in different countries and no government can block this technology transfer today. Douglas you have made a system, would you like to go to the camera? Would you show us? We share the knowledge in a rapid way in the past two weeks to make sure that no government can stop us. It is done by the Americans. The technology of the Keshe Foundation has been shared with 3 nations at the highest level.<br>凯史：我们来看看它是如何以及为什么使肉体产生了这样一种变化。你们都可以回家去;你们没有正确地进行传送，这样当你返回去的时候你会跑到太空中去的。Renen,你在后台吗？或者乔纳森，或者伯尼在吗？道格拉斯你在这个国家是有这套物理系统的。漂亮的是我们已经在不同的国家做到了这一点，如今就没有哪个政府能够阻止这种技术传递。道格拉斯你已经做出了一套系统，你愿意到镜头前面来吗？你愿意展示给我们看吗？我们在过去的两个星期内用一种飞快的方式分享这种知识，以确保没有哪一个政府能够阻止我们。我们这么做都是由于美国造成的。凯史基金会技术的最高水平已经在三个国家内共享。</p>
<p>Jonathan (J): I can present the initial design we have come up with?<br>乔纳森（以下简称为：乔）：凯史先生，我是乔纳森。我能介绍下我们已经带来的最初的设计吗？</p>
<p>K: these are the basic We have no blue prints of the space ship created for the conditions needed for space travel.<br>凯史：好的，你可以给我们分享下吗？现在我们还没有具有太空旅行所需条件的太空飞船的蓝图。你能给我们演示下吗？</p>
<p>J: 1.11.38 picture—this is the initial design that we have. Renen gave me the concept of the double core set up. (Plastic gear at the top with bearings connected to a plastic shaft tube inserted into the core. The center of the core is surrounded by nano coated copper mesh. This is the initial setup. The design is to make to make two different directions.<br>乔：图1.11.38—-这是我们最初的设计。是Renen给我的建立双核心的概念。在顶部，带轴承的塑料齿轮与一个插入到核心的塑料轴管相连接。核心的中心被由纳米涂层的铜网包裹。这就是初始装置。设计了两个不同的方向。</p>
<p>K: go back a couple of steps to the total picture. This is a blue print you have to understand is that when you look at this diagram.<br>凯史：回到你前面显示的那一张图。当你看到这张图时：</p>
<p>这是一张你必须理解的蓝图。</p>
<p>This is your container of the plasma material.<br>这是你的等离子材料的容器：</p>
<p>This is the way you get to look at it. The green center with the copper around it in the drawing is the coil which is made to have dynamism around it and not a flat rotation. (01：27：30 minutes).<br>从这个方向上去看，它就是这个样子。图中心绿色部分的周围是铜线圈，是用于在周围产生活力的，他不是水平旋转的。（01:27:30分钟）。</p>
<p>You don’t need to have any sealing around the core material and there can be as many holes on all the balls, because now you have dictated it. There is no need for a vacuum and you can make as much holes as you like in it because the parameter of the ball itself has dictated the condition ，so you don’t have to worry about sealing anything. There is no sealant in the universe.</p>
<p>核心材料周围不需要有任何密封的，所有的球上面都可以有许多洞的，因为现在你已经控制了它。没必要做成真空的。只要你喜欢，你可以在上面造尽可能多的洞，因为球本身的参数决定了条件，所以你不必担心要密封任何东西。宇宙中没有密封胶。</p>
<p>[01:28:03]<br>K: What comes in，comes in, becomes a part.(Whatever comes in becomes a part of what it came into.) So, these cores ，you look at before, were made a vacuum ,you made all sorts of things. You don’t need that anymore. As long as you create the dimension of hold, that ,what you mix in that environment creates its own ,</p>
<p>凯史：无论进入核心来的是什么，它们都会变成核心的一部分。所以，核心部分形成了一个真空，这是你们以前曾经看到过的。你们过去制造了各种各样的东西，你再也不需要那样去做了。只要你创造并保持这个环境，那么，你混进那个环境中的东西就将创造出它的自身，</p>
<p>and this tube inside, here (the red part) has to be hollow, that your empty space of plasma is created. The size of this tube will give you the strength of ，and the amount of your fields.<br>而在中间的这个容器，这里（凯史把核心涂成红色），必须是中空的，于是你的等离子体的空间就被创建出来。这个容器的大小决定了提供给你的场的强度。</p>
<p>So what you need to do， as you have seen, you put the coils around it which you embed in.</p>
<p>因此，你需要做的，正如你所看到的，是你把线圈放到核心容器的周围（凯史画了3条红色的线代表3个线圈）。</p>
<p>[01:28:58]<br>K: Can you go to the next picture please? Jonathan？<br>凯史：你可以翻到下一张图吗？乔纳森？<br>J：This one？ Sir？</p>
<p>乔：先生，是这张图吗？<br>K：Carry on，carry on, further. Please。Go further.<br>凯史：还得继续翻，再往前面翻。麻烦了。翻多点。<br>J：That point？<br>乔：是那张吗？</p>
<p>[01:29:17]<br>K：Yes. That’s OK. Have your ahead, Please.(Go to the drawing) where you get the coil,where you go to the coils please.<br>凯史：是的，就是这张。就是你面前的这张。谢谢。请你显示到线圈那儿可以吗？</p>
<p>[01:29:27]<br>J：OK. So on，that it is I go when we talk. I talk the environment was that we going to creat, ah, a  year of time that I put, put eight in the pro specific directions. So I know how to come to design go is we opportune we creat by that barry system, yes,this one,</p>
<p>乔：好的。我来说说。 我们正在谈论的这个装置就是我做的。我说的环境是指我们要创造的环境,啊,我花了一年的时间,在八个特定的方向。所以我知道如何用那个巴里系统，适合时机地去创造。是的,就是这张图。,</p>
<p>[01:30:08]<br>K：Go back forward to where you connect to the coils.<br>凯史：往前翻，到你连接到线圈的那张图去。<br>J：This matter?<br>乔：是这个吗？</p>
<p>K: Carry on,carry on,carry on.<br>凯史：放大些，继续，继续。</p>
<p>[01:30:20]<br>K: You see in this position,now you have a cavity, over the cavity ,which is created by the size of the matter state ,which you convert into a plasma state. Go over and forward to your last pictures,please.</p>
<p>凯史：你看这个位置，在这个腔的上面，现在出现一个腔，，它被创造出来的大小是由你的物质态的大小决定的，在那里，物质态转换成等离子态。请继续往前，翻到你的最后一张图。<br>[01:31:46]<br>You don’t need the mechanism; go forward to the next step where you join the core and the coils; I am not interesting in the gear box. We just want to see the core and the coils. We have a bad connection to the Philippines today; we tried it this morning.</p>
<p>凯史：你不需要这个机制，前进到下一个步骤，也就是你加入核心和线圈的地方，我对齿轮箱不感兴趣。我们只想看到的核心和线圈。今天我们和菲律宾的网络连接不太好，我们今天早上试过了。<br>K: do you have the 2 dimensional drawings Douglas?<br>凯史：道格拉斯，你有那个2维的平面图吗？<br>D: drawing<br>道：图…</p>
<p>[01:34:16]<br>K: OK，this is how it looks: stay the normal.<br>凯史：好了，这就是它的样子。保持正常。</p>
<p>K:This is your core and inside the dynamic and this is your coils. You can take energy if you are interesting，300 Megawatts is no problem. We are looking for a 3 ~ 4 terawatts, no problem. It is you who decides …(what’s the problem? what’s the problem?J,J touch something.) The only way you understand the power of change is which coil you use or if you are interested in the electro-vibration, if you are interested in the crumbs, we can give you trillions of ‘crumbs.’ Or you are interesting in the plasmatic condition. In the next presentation you will see something different  which will show in the minute. Can we have your next picture? Please.<br>凯史:这是你的核心，内部是动态的,这是你的线圈。如果你有兴趣的,你可以提取其中的能量，300兆瓦都没有问题。我们正在寻找一个3 ~ 4 兆兆瓦的,也不会有问题。都是由你来决定…(有什么问题吗?是什么问题?J，J碰到了什么东西。)你理解的力量改变的唯一方法就是你使用哪个线圈或者如果你对电振动有兴趣；如果你对面包屑有兴趣,我们可以给你数万亿的面包屑；或者你对等离子体条件感兴趣。在接下来几分钟之内的介绍中你将会看到不同的东西。可以显示你的下一张照片吗?有请。<br>[01:35:29]<br>K：What you see even is nearly a week today they are working on, is the preliminary and more or less obsolete . but we have to go through it， but we can not understand it. This is… Would you like to explain to us? Douglas? What it is somebody done? …Are you there？Hello？</p>
<p>凯史：今天你看到的是近一个星期他们正在研究的,还是初步的,或多或少地过时了。但我们必须经过这个过程,因为我们还不能理解它。这是…你愿意给我们解释下吗?道格拉斯，它是什么人做的什么东西?…..你还在那儿吗？喂？</p>
<p>[01:35:58]<br>D: Sorry！sorry， Mr. Keshe. I was miss. Yes, this is the stand that I used to fabricate the coils on. I don’t like having metal inside the container so you’ll see in a minute a different apparatus.</p>
<p>道：对不起!对不起，凯史先生。我掉线了。是的，这是我用来制作线圈的平台。我不喜欢在容器里有金属，所以你会在下一分钟内看到一个不同的装置。</p>
<p>[01:36:12]<br>D：But I use this stand as a temporary device to build the coils and get them align properly and connected properly. You can see the ‘caroline’ core inside,and this is a hollow tube that here is nano-coated wire and it goes down inside and ‘caroline’ the outer core. The ‘caroline’ core be on the inside with a butterfly loop around it of a smaller ball on the inside of a ping pong ball which was quite a task.<br>道：但我使用这个平台作为一个临时设备，用来建造线圈，使它们正确地对齐、连接正确。你可以在里面看到”卡洛琳”核心，这是一个中空的管，这里是纳米涂层的线，它向下进入内部，还有这个是”卡洛琳”的外核。”卡洛琳”核心放在个更小的球—-一个乒乓球的内部，有一个蝴蝶环围绕着它，这是一个相当困难的任务。<br>[01:36:42]</p>
<p>D：I’ll go to the next picture, here, just the,another view of the same set up.<br>道：我要放下一张图了。看这里，这只是同一个装置的另一个视图。<br>D：And here is…… inside the container is what I was，seeing how much room，what kind of room I was now can have in this container ？What are great information when we use this one?<br>道:这个是……我现在正在检查看在这个容器内部有多少空间，我可以在这个容器中得到什么样的空间？当我们使用这个装置时最重要的信息是什么？</p>
<p>D：And, sorry about,let we go.<br>道：对不起,（这张图不对），让我们继续。</p>
<p>D：This is the final assembly, and you can see the core energy of the Magravs, in that neatly and connected properly. I have placed the ‘caroline’ core in the center and it is free to rotate.<br>道：这是最后的组装,你可以看到磁引力场的核心能量,在那整齐、正确地连接好了。我已经把”卡洛琳”核心放在中心位置，它可以自由旋转。</p>
<p>D：And this is a side view of it. And you can see it is all copper and there is no steel in there and the plastic with the ‘caroline’ core in the center.<br>道：这是一个侧面。你可以看到它都是由铜做的，没有钢铁，”卡洛琳”的核心在塑料容器的中心。</p>
<p>D:And,this is the motor they drive it, it is on top here. I am holding it in stationary， and right there. It is spinning and I am eager to put gans water in it and start this thing tomorrow forward.<br>道:,这是他们用于驱动装置的马达，在这个上面。我正稳定地拿着它，它正在旋转,我渴望把甘斯水放进去,我明天就开始做这个东西。</p>
<p>[01:37:49]<br>K: Thank you very much！ You got to understand we had to hold this information back as much as possible,that we do not repeat the ‘accidental’ accident of Fabio with other members of the Keshe Foundation if you look at this structure here.If you can go on the camera please? Kemi ,just go on the camera?<br>凯史：非常感谢你！你们得明白，如果你们在这里看到了这个结构,必须回去尽可能多地保存这些信息，我们不能让凯史基金会的其他成员重复法比奥的“意外”事故。凯米，你可以去摄像机那里吗？只是去拍摄好吗？<br>Kemi:Sure,it is.<br>凯米:当然可以。<br>K:You,you got … Can you take a picture, start the picture please? And then you stop sharing? En,if you look that structure,it’s exactly the Magrav unit with the core—- dynamic core in the center. This is what we told you original from the beginning: the Magrav systems will be everything you need.<br>凯史：你，你去……你能去拍照，启动画面吗？然后你停止共享？嗯，如果你看到了那个结构，它就是在中心部位带核心—-动态核心的磁引力场装置。这就是我们从一开始就告诉你们的：磁引力场系统将成为你所需要的一切。</p>
<p>K：If you want to see how you create powers the way you like, you will have Armen on the line,can we see Arman in the background?<br>凯史：如果你想看看你如何用你喜欢的方式来创造力量，阿尔曼在线会回答你，我们可以在背景上看到阿尔曼吗？<br>Kemi:Yeh……<br>凯米：是的。<br>K:Armen,are you there?Armenjia,Armanjia,can you show us the system which just finished with the copper ring in the middle?<br>凯史：阿尔曼，你在吗？Armenjia，Armanjia，你能给我们展示下你刚完成的铜环在中间的那个系统吗？<br>Armen：Sure，Messiah.<br>阿尔曼：当然，弥赛亚。</p>
<p>K：Share the screen.<br>凯史：分享下屏幕。</p>
<p>[01:39:21]<br>Armen: This is not assembled yet but TA.( you can see the stack of the coils. )<br>阿尔曼：这个还没有组装好，但是你可以看到一层层线圈组成的栈。</p>
<p>K: So,the core is in the center? You have two Hubert spring ,Armen,please？<br>凯史：那么，核心是在中心位置吗？阿尔曼，你有两个休伯特弹簧，是吗？(译者注：休伯特发明了手电筒、发动机、留声机、蒸汽机)<br>A: Yeh，you have a，you have a copper coil in the center that not nano-coated and two nano-coated coils，we call one top one bottom. And it is not connected yet. So what we think it as a sofa.<br>阿尔曼：是的。你看，在中间那层有一个不带纳米涂层的铜线圈，在它两侧各有一个带纳米涂层的铜线圈—-我们把左边这个叫作顶层，右边那个叫作底层。它们还没有连接好。我们认为它象一个沙发。</p>
<p>K:And the core?<br>凯史：那么核心呢？</p>
<p>A：Then in the middle it goes this core.yeh.<br>阿尔曼：在中间的是这个球状核心。耶。<br>a</p>
<p>A: Let me show you on the moter.<br>阿尔曼：让我给你展示下电机。</p>
<p>A:This is inside in other core。<br>阿尔曼：这个就是另一个核心的内部。（手心里面是个小电机。一个核心是需要与电机相连的，另一个核心是不需要电机的。）</p>
<p>[01:40:12]<br>K: if you look he has gotten to a nano-coated wires on top of both coils, so the continues he makes. With the problem with this is still has a motor. En, Armen,would you like to show us the un-motor man exactly the way is in the space,please? We don’t see any engines and motors on the end of each planet.<br>凯史：如果你看到他在两端的线圈都有纳米涂层的线圈，就让他继续去做。问题是还有一个电机。嗯，阿尔曼，你愿意向我们展示下在太空中不用电机的确切方法吗？我们在每个星球的端部都没有看到任何发动机和电机啊。<br>A:Yes.<br>阿尔曼：好的。<br>[01:40:40]<br>K:Arman is in the phase of replication of the same process universe—rotation without any motors. Would you show us what you have that will be ready by tomorrow?<br>凯史：阿尔曼是在复制相同的宇宙运行过程—-不需要任何电机就能旋转。你能在明天准备好并给我们演示吗？<br>[01:40:55]<br>A: Yes, it’s to be right by tomorrow. This,only you have to do is, you know, connect your cores in the middle. Which I want to prepare by tomorrow. So that I can control. It goes in the middle. And your connections by the way of core.<br>阿尔曼：是的，明天就能准备好。你剩下要做的，你知道的，就是把核心连接到线圈组的中间去。我想明天之前就能准备好。让我可以控制。铜制核心会在线圈组的中间。并通过核心与你进行连接。</p>
<p>[01:41:18]<br>K: In this set up there is no motor to start， and there is no ignition point.<br>凯史：这个装置中就没有马达启动，也没有点火的地方。<br>He uses the capacitors and the unit , because everything in it is in plasma condition and it immerses in the liquid plasma and he creates his own dimension.<br>他在这个装置内使用电容器，因为装置中的一切都是在等离子体条件下，它沉浸在液态等离子中，他创造了他自己的维度。（译者理解：这个维度就像收音机的频道有很多个，其中一个频道是你自己的）<br>With this, if you understand, you can produce megawatts of energy .<br>使用这个，如果你能理解，你就能制造兆瓦级别的能量。<br>because the speed of rotation and the liquid gans which you put in, with changing the middle one，the matter state…..<br>因为旋转的速度以及你投入的液体甘斯，通过改变位于中间的那个，物质状态……<br>[01:41:58]<br>K：Can you stop? Share who parter?<br>凯史(对阿尔曼说)：你能停下来吗？做分享的伙伴？（因为阿尔曼不停地在背景画面上摆弄他的装置，影响了凯史授课。）<br>[01:42:00]- [01:42:37]<br>K：So,the middle core,is changed to matter state and release of the plasma from the inside dictates what you like, megawatts, gig watts, or kilowatts. The energy production is unlimited， the source is the free condition plasma rotation and the energy crisis which was to exploit man to be the slave and to those control man’s food and energy is finished！ You can produce this anywhere in the universe.<br>凯史：那么，你放入中间核心内的甘斯，就转变到了物质状态，并从内部释放等离子体，释放能量的多少是根据你的喜好来决定的，兆瓦、吉瓦（1吉瓦=1000兆瓦）或千瓦都可以。能源的生产是无限的，能量的来源是自由状态条件下的等离子体的转动，能源危机和那些通过控制人们食物和能源，把人当奴隶一样利用的时代结束了！你可以在宇宙中任何地方制造这些。<br>[01:42:37]- [01:43:23]<br>K: Your system fails. you have to be able to restart. If you understand it,you can do what you like, if you have the condition on either side, you can create any kind of food, metal, energy, positioning. You increase one in the structure and the other you become magnetical, you become gravitational. You position this in the star formation and then you decide the span of your space system. This way we tap in to the universal energy without any matter state.<br>凯史：如果你的系统失败了，你必须能够重新启动。如果你理解它，你可以做你喜欢做的任何事，如果你具备有任何一方的条件，你可以创建任何种类的食物、金属、能源、定位。你在这个结构中增加这一个，你就变成了磁力；你增加另一个，你就变成了重力。你在恒星机构中定位，你可以决定你在太空空间系统中的跨度。用这种方式，我们就进入到了没有任何物质状态的宇宙能量之中。</p>
<p>[01:43:24]- [01:43:56]<br>K: The progress was to bring it to this point，the progress was to bring this situation under control. Now,if our friends who are in the disaster zone understand this, it makes it absolutely possible in the max of next few weeks, we support, we transport the technology and the knowledge that you need to place a very few of these very much like satellites around the disaster zones.<br>凯史：进展的关键就是要把你带到这一点上并能控制各种情况。现在，如果我们在灾区的朋友们理解这一点，我们传送的这个技术和知识，在未来最多几周时间之内绝对有可能被用上，你只需要在灾区周围，非常像卫星那样放置极少数的装置，</p>
<p>[01:43:57]- [01:44:40]<br>K:You feed people with it, they receive energy from it. You don’t need to make bottles to give each individual to drink. Everybody has access everything from antibiotics to steaks and chips,because the emotion of the man will carry it. These systems in collaboration in the right way will make shielding barriers that no one can penetrate. Those of you who are in governmental level, we are present good morning to you; you understand fully what we are talking about.<br>凯史：你可以用它养活人，他们从中得到能量。你不需要做瓶子给每个人喝。每个人都享有一切，从抗生素到牛排、薯条，因为人的情绪会提取它。如果这些系统以正确的方式运作，它将制造出没有人能够穿越的保护罩。你们中那些在政府层面的人，我们向你们问好，你们完全明白我们正在谈论什么。</p>
<p>[01:44:44]- [01:45:14]<br>K: this means we can disarm any man through psychological approach to bring him to the balance because that’s  what they needs. The war planned for Iran will bring doom to the hands of the wars will set it up in Tel Aviv and in Washington. We protect the nations through the technology and not by this struction.<br>凯史：这意味着我们可以通过心理学的途径解除任何人的武装，我们可以把他带到平衡，因为那才是他们所需要的东西。特拉维夫（译者注：以色列首都，第二大城市）和华盛顿亲手策划的伊朗战争将会给以色列和美国带来厄运。我们通过这个技术而不是这个结构来保护伊朗这个国家。</p>
<p>[01:45:16]- [01:45:47]<br>K：We will launch，please understand fully，you have every knowledge now to create whatever you need. You were given the gans to drink ，now you have the mother of the gans, the plasma free condition is the intention， is the recipient. In so many ways thank you very much; we have made one planet, one race out of the man.<br>凯史：我们即将起飞，请充分理解，你现在有创造你所需要的每一种知识。给你喝的甘斯，现在你又有了甘斯的来源—-等离子自由环境是目的、是容器。在许多方面都非常感谢你，我们已经创造了一个星球、一个种族的人类。</p>
<p>[01:45:47]- [01:46:29]<br>K:But you got to understand very simply, it is you now who decides how to develop this technology into the next step of the space motion. The Magrav systems in totality in conjunction with the coils are the tools for you to produce the free plasma condition of the center. if you put a little ,you get an atom , if you put more ,you get the structure interaction with the planets , if you absorb more inside ,it concentrated more, you will get galaxy conditions. If you want to do more ,you can go to the universal condition.<br>凯史：但是你必须非常简单地去理解，现在是你决定如何将这项空间运动技术发展到下一步。磁引力场系统与线圈的整体连接是你在中心部位制造自由等离子体环境的工具。如果你放一点，你得到一个原子；如果你放得更多，你得到的结构与行星的相互作用；如果在内部吸收的越多，它集中得越多，你会得到星系的环境；如果你想做得更多，你可以去宇宙环境。</p>
<p>[01:46:29]- [01:47:21]<br>K: what you have to understand you got to do is this:<br>凯史：你要知道你要做的就是这个：<br>K：Can I get my screen back? OK. Thank you very much. You need to remove on the screen. Further?<br>凯史：我能把我的屏幕拿回来吗？好的，非常感谢你。你需要在屏幕上删除。好了没？<br>Kemi：I got that finish. Yet.<br>凯米：我弄好了。<br>K：OK.You have to understand in the structure of the inner core， what your drawing? You have the core; this is your ping pong ball,<br>凯史：好了。你必须理解内部核心的结构，你的图是什么样子的呢？你有这个核心，这是你的乒乓球，</p>
<p> K: You have another core inside which outside here is all the liquids.<br>凯史：你在核心内还有另一个核心，外层核心的外面到处都是液体。</p>
<p>[01:47:22]- [01:47:51]<br>K: In rotating this one (the outer core) at a given speed，<br>凯史：用给定的速度旋转这一个（外核），</p>
<p>K:you create a plasma condition here which covers this （inner core）. But, now (the red circle)this is the ‘caroline’ core.<br>凯史：你在这里创建了一个包含这个（内核）的等离子状态。但是，现在(红圈)这儿是“卡洛琳”核心。</p>
<p>K： with the spinning of the ‘caroline’ core, now you create another plasma inside（the inner core）.<br>凯史：随着“卡洛琳”核心的旋转，现在你在内核里面就创造出了另一个等离子体。</p>
<p>[01:47:51]- [01:48:44]<br>K：Don’t forget this inner core still has nano-coated wires on it. And the outer core still has nano-coated wires on it.<br>凯史：别忘了这个内核仍然有纳米涂层的铜线绕在上面。外核也有纳米涂层的铜线绕在上面。</p>
<p>K：Now you have this frame, The speed of the rotation of this (blue) one(the inner core) will compact the spin core —this one(plasma inside the inner core).<br>凯史：现在你有了这个框架，这个（蓝色）（内核）的带速度的旋转将压紧这个旋转核心—内核里面的等离子体。</p>
<p>[01:48:46]- [01:49:22]<br>K：The strength of the position of the black one will compact the energy of this (red) one. So, you can see again，by stirring the fields of this (red) environment，you strengthen the field of here(plasma inside the inner core). You go from hydrogen to plutonium instantly.<br>在黑色这个（外核）的位置上的力量将压紧这个（红色的）“卡洛琳”核心的能量。所以，你可以再看一下，通过搅拌（红色的）这个环境的场，你加强了这儿的场（指内核里面的等离子体）。你就可以立即从氢变到钚。</p>
<p>[01:49:22]- [01:49:41]<br>K: if you go in a different strength， in a different dimension, you create the gravitational magnetic fields of the moon ，or the magnetical field of the moon. Attracted , repulse.<br>凯史：如果你用一个不同的强度，在不同的维度上，你就创造了月球的引力场或月球的磁场。（手势指内部）这是引力，（手势指外部）这是斥力。</p>
<p>[01:49:41]- [01:50:35]<br>K：When I showed the basic understanding of this to the guys from American space agency in the small presentation they understand. Maybe you understand in a very simple way too. If I now make sense to you what we showed. Those who are intelligent understood it very rapidly. Those who not, they blamed it because of their own lack of understanding. I show it to you and now you understand what it means. I come very close and you will understand. I don’t use any energy; I just join the matter state (two magnets).<br>凯史：当我向美国宇航局的人展示这一基本的原理，他们能够理解。也许你也能用一种非常简单的方式进行理解。如果我们现在的展示会对你有意义。那些聪明的人很快就明白了。而那些不理解的人，他们会指责它，是因为他们自己的缺乏了解。我向你展示它，现在你明白它意味着什么。我走得很近，你将会明白的。我不使用任何能量，我只是加入了物质状态（两个磁铁）。</p>
<p>[01:50:35]- [01:50:58]<br>K：How fast do you want to travel (with) no fuel? You join the line of field forces and in this process, very soon you’ll find out he change the gravitational magnetic field inside the core by rotating it in different strengths and organizing it to go at the speed you want.<br>凯史：不带燃料，你的旅行能有多快？你加入磁力线的力量，在这个过程中，很快你会发现他改变了核心内部的引力磁场，通过用不同的力量去旋转它，并以你想要的速度去组织它。<br>[01:50:58]- [01:52:46]<br>K: at the moment for those scientific organization who worked and understood it, they are protecting islands，they are protecting space and they are traveling in a different dimension that most of you cannot even imagine. I thank the Iranian space agency and the people who use it for protecting those who were getting abused. If we deliver this technology in the center of Washington there shall be no communication between the Pentagon and the soldiers ，and they cannot create any more crimes. Maybe that is what we have to do. If we stop and deliver the fields at the strength of that every man on the territory of Iran who wishes for 1000 kilogram of gold, we can transfer all of it to London so that the Queen of England will not create more wars. But, one thing you have to remember, as much as we cannot touch the matter state, we can transfer the soul of these out of the dimensions of this planet so that there shall be no rulers. Start producing these systems very rapidly as much as you can. You have all the tools, you have all the means and you have seen very simple people in Philippines ,in the states and two different locations,now in China and the others are ready to create equality in science and knowledge.<br>凯史：此刻，那些有人在里面工作的科学组织能够理解，他们正在保护岛屿，他们正在保护太空，他们正在一个不同维度进行旅行，你们中的大多数人甚至无法想象。我感谢伊朗航天局和使用它来保护那些被虐待的人。如果我们在华盛顿的中心提供这项技术，就不会有五角大楼和士兵之间的沟通，他们就不能创造更多的犯罪。也许这是我们必须做的。如果我们停下来把在伊朗境内每个人希望得到1000公斤黄金的愿望以某种强度的场的方式传递出去，我们可以这些愿望全部传到伦敦，这样，英国女王就不会创造更多的战争了。但是，有一件事你必须记住，我们不能接触到足够多的物质状态，我们可以将这些灵魂转移到这个星球以外的维度，这样就不会有统治者了。你要尽可能多的、非常快速地开始生产这些系统。你有所有的工具，你有所有的手段，你已经看到在菲律宾这个国家的两个不同的地点有着非常淳朴的人，现在在中国和其他国家，正准备创造科学和知识的平等。</p>
<p>[01:52:46]- [01:53:44]<br>K: I have been told that I am releasing too much advanced information in the hands of the public and they don’t understand what to do with it. My answer is the opposite. I give enough to the public that those who are afraid to have their hands be opened up and are afraid that their souls might speak the language of the man, and then we know what mischief these people have been up to. If you understood you can create the gravitational magnetic field of an atom, of a star, stainless steel and (you can) create the strength of the soul of the president of the US which has committed so much murder in such a short time in a Black Office. The soul shall speak , the fear of the world leaders will not be them speaking but their souls revealing the truth.<br>凯史：我被告知，我释放了太多先进的信息并把它们交到公众的手中，但是人们不明白该怎么去做。我的答案是相反的。我已经给予公众足够的知识。有些人害怕他们的手被打开、害怕他们的灵魂会说人类的语言，这样我们就会知道这些人有哪些危害了。如果你理解你可以创造出一个原子、一颗星球、不锈钢的引力磁场，你就可以创造出美国总统的灵魂的力量，在这么短的时间内，在一个黑人办公室里犯了这么多的谋杀案。灵魂会说话，世界领导人的恐惧不会让他们说话，而是他们的灵魂会揭露真相。<br> [01:53:46]- [01:54:39]<br>K: Very easily as I said in my talk, the Snowden affair will be the affair of the soul of the Snowden. There will be such a snowball that no leader can stand. Start creating very simply with peace and run your reactors. As long as you are sincere and you create the emotion and the strength of peace you shall see no color and when you see the color it means that you are lying to yourself. Take the systems to world leaders and tell them one thing: tell us you want peace and we will listen to your word and we see your soul. And then you will hear the voice of the man through his soul.<br>凯史：这会非常简单，就像我在我的谈话中说过的那样，斯诺登事件将是斯诺登灵魂的事。将有这样一个雪球，没有一个领导者能够站得住的。带着和平，你从非常简单的创建开始去做，去运行你的反应器。只要你是真诚的，你就能创造出和平的情感和力量，你会看不到颜色，当你看到的颜色，这意味着你对自己说谎。把这个系统带给世界的领导人，告诉他们一件事：告诉我们，你希望和平。我们会听你的语言，我们能看到你的灵魂。然后你会听到这个人通过他的灵魂发出的声音。</p>
<p>[01:54:40]- [01:55:57]<br>K: we said we (would) enter the political arena in July. We are here to enter ,not in one government but in all the governments of the world. the mayhem, hunger and abuse has come to a point that now the only option left to make it more， that somewhere it becomes so bad that we will literally see man is slaughtering man for a piece of bread as they did in one of the richest nations in the world like Syria. Now maybe Europe and the States will have a taste of what they have done to the others. And do we stand to help those who have damaged the soul or do we go through the process of the Universal Council operation which means that we give them the souls of those who have committed the crimes against other souls and we give them the shoe of the dead man. It is very hard if you have to be there. The prison in the universe is not boxed and closed. The seal of the jail of the universe is being subordinate to the soul of the man which you have damaged. You become the slave of your own act.<br>凯史：我们说过在（2016年）7月，我们将进入政坛。我们在这里进入，不是一个政府，而是世界上所有的政府。残害、饥饿和弊端已经到了一个时间点，现在剩下的唯一选择就是创造更多的。有些地方已经变得非常糟糕，我们看到人们为了争夺一块面包而杀人，我们一点都没夸张。这就是在世界上最富有的国家之一，例如叙利亚，发生的真实的事情。也许现在只有欧洲和美国还想尝一尝别人肉的味道，他们曾经也这么做过。我们是该站在毁坏灵魂者那一边并助纣为虐呢，还是按照宇宙议会的操作流程进行呢？意思是说我们会把那些对其他灵魂犯过罪行的灵魂交给宇宙议会，我们还会把死人的鞋子也一起交上去。如果你必须要去宇宙监狱那里，那里可是很苦的。宇宙监狱可不是盒状的，是个封闭的地方。宇宙监狱的封印是在那些你曾毁坏的人的灵魂手上。你将成为你自己行为的奴隶。<br>[01:56:03]- [01:58:00]<br>K: Remember one thing: when you drop a drop of the gans water of copper in a bucket of water ，every plasma gans of the water will carry the information. So, there will be less but equal. Now imagine how many men you have murdered or profited by murdering and now your soul has to divide to be imprisoned in thousands of souls. How much torture do you want to accept? Now you understand how we have punished you by your own acts and deeds and not by us. Now you create the same condition in your reactors. Mix as many gans as you can; do not be afraid. The more gans you mix in the bottle or the bucket the more variety and strength in the center core you have. But there is one point—a very strange point. As you have managed to create the condition of the soul of yourself and you can communicate to understand the strength of the soul of any other man because it is made of gravitational magnetic field, if your wish is to meet the Christ, bless his name in the soul, he will tell you the truth he wrote in the bible. And then I wonder if there is room for the Vatican? When the man speaks himself, he does not need any messengers.<br>凯史：记住一件事：当你把一滴铜甘斯水滴到一桶水里面时，每个等离子甘斯水都会携带信息。有的会携带较少但都是平等的。现在想想你曾经谋杀过或通过谋杀而获益的人数，现在你的灵魂将被分为成千上万份并投入监狱。你想接受多少折磨？现在你明白我们是如何根据你自己的所作所为而不是我们的，来惩罚你的了。现在你在你的反应器中创造了同样的条件。尽可能多地混合各种甘斯吧，不用害怕。你在瓶子里或桶里面混合的甘斯种类越多，你在反应器核心获得的种类和能力越多。但有一点—-有一点很奇怪：当你设法创造你自己的灵魂的条件时，你可以沟通，以了解任何其他人的灵魂的力量，因为它是由引力磁场造成的，如果你的愿望是见见基督，在灵魂中赞美他的名字，他就会告诉你他在圣经中写的事情的真相。然后我想知道是否有为梵蒂冈准备的房间？当这个人说话的时候，他不需要任何信使。</p>
<p>第四部分笔译——一步穿锣<br>K: in the coming time now that you have the freedom then start emphasizing the freedom of the universe. We have given you the key to the universal interaction and very soon those of you who have the wrong intention will find out that you mixed the wrong plasma in the container of your emotions and not in the container of your craft. Those who planned murders to gain physicality, you all have very limited time. All of you have the knowledge and you can change the condition of the animal-ness of this planet to the true peace with a piece of copper if you understood. Then you can feed nations through their souls and you can join the universal community through the line of the peace of this planet. And those who came here caused so much mayhem and stopped doing their jobs right. They are already on their way back. A number of governments with access to these lines of communication will tell you that everytime information was given for advancement, they used it for murder.<br>凯史:在即将到来的时间里，你现在拥有自由，然后开始去强调在这个宇宙中的自由。我们给你去与宇宙来往的钥匙，很快，你们那些错误的意图将发现你混合了错误的等离子体在你的情感的容器里面，而不是在你的太空船容器里面。那些打算通过谋杀来获得肉体利益的人，你们所有人都只有有限的时间，你们所有人拥有这个知识，你们可以改变这个星球上的动物的习性，用铜板去成为真实的和平者，如果你理解这点。然后，你可以通过他们的灵魂去喂饱整个国家，你可以通过这个星球的和平路线去加入宇宙社区。那些来到这里引发无数伤害的人，正确地停止他们的工作，他们已经回到正途。政府的通过网络信息发布的一些数字将告诉你每时每刻他们都在交换利益，他们用它去谋杀。</p>
<p>K: There are no leading nations according to the population which has not been or is not in touch or has a line of communication with the universal community. But, every time we feed information we get the wrong result. Now it is for man to change the course. Build as many of these systems and as much gans as you like and create the flow of the non-motorized system like the earth in the cosmos. Armen will show it to you and others will bring it to you. If you go a step further in putting the gans water in the tank through your emotion you shall create the condition of the rotation anywhere in that container that you like so you go a step further. If you do not reach that point at least you cause an intermediary system. You create the condition. Remember the very simple part of my teachings, I always explained this and being passive you did not understand.<br>凯史：没有主要的国家依据种群，那还没有，或者没有接触到，或者有一条与宇宙社区的通信线路。但是，任何时候，我们提供讯息，我们获得错误的结果。现在是人类转变的历程，建造很多这些系统，很多甘斯，就像你喜欢的，建造流动的而不是机械化的系统，就像在宇宙中的地球。阿曼将给你展示它，其他人将为你带来它。如果你去到一个更深的阶段，在水槽中放置甘斯水，通过你的情感，你将在容器的任何地方创造你喜欢的旋转的状态，因此你进入到更深的阶段。如果你不到达那一点，至少你要引入一个媒介系统。你创造这个条件。记住我教学中非常简单的部分，我反复解释过这个，你们被动地，还是没有理解。</p>
<p>K: maybe some of you will understand more if you go back to the teaching especially in the private teachings where I asked to students to create one thing or another. But if you have no free plasma liquid in this box (1.48.34 minutes) and you know you can create in the later stage through the interaction of your understanding motion and control of the others, and then start looking into these boxes. You put the amino acids inside and you concentrate and give the field of where you want to put your stick of ‘cotton candy.’ You decide and you start. You will see beginning some motion and then you will see the rotation. Empty the bottle and the field will still be there because you have created it. You can move it in one by one, and you can move it out one by one. You can create this and make this a pool of the fields.

This is how you make the 4 star formation for deep space travel.<br>凯史：也许你们某些人理解更多，如果你回到私人的特别教学，在那里我要求学生去创造一个东西或者其他，但是如果你没有自由等离子体液体在这个盒子里，你知道你可以在后期创建，通过你理解的互动动作，控制其他东西，然后开始研究这些盒子，你放入氨基酸在里面，你全神贯注地给它场体，然后拿出你的“棉花糖”棍子，你决定开始，你将看见一些动作开始产生，然后你将看见旋转，空的瓶子场体依然在那里，因为你创造了它。你可以一个接一个地移动它，你可以创建这个场体的撞球。创建你的场体，{你的来自121次知识寻求者教学2016年7月24日DRAFT（脚本未被证实，再次点击视频）}20星以及你的行星，移动它，因为现在由你控制和看管。制造另外一个。这是你如何制造4个球体的星体组合为了在外太空旅行。</p>
<p>K: some of you will bridge this in a very short time. Some of you will take hundreds of years to understand this. We have thought enough. Most of you can; this is how you make and how planets have been out of the fields of the universe. We don’t bring a planet or a galaxy; we make a planet or a galaxy. We don’t bring the star or the universe; we bring the fields and according to the interaction of the fields the entity takes hold. So, if you are the master of your art and if you start learning what it is and how it should be, all the teachings of the past two years will come to the final point, when by your emotion you dictate the size. I want the field to be the field of gold. It is very easy; I will do this for you and then you understand how feeble these people are. You put your hand in the water and wish cold and you come out with the cold hand. You decide the amount. You decide your intention and position and the system confirms your existence and ability and you can take whatever you like from it.<br>凯史：你们一些人将在很短的时间内理解这个，你们一些人将在许多年以后才能理解这个。我们认为足够了。你们大部分人能够，这就是你如何制造，一直在宇宙的场体之外的行星。我们不能带来一个行星或者一个星系，我们制造一个行星或者一个星系。我们不能带来这个星体或者宇宙，我们带来这个场体，取决于所掌握的实体的场体的互动。所以，如果你是你的艺术的大师，如果开始学习这是什么，它因该是怎样的，学习了所有过去两年以来所教授的，你将来到这个终点，我将为你做这个，然后，你将理解这些人如何的虚弱，你把你的手放入水中，希望降温，你抽回你寒冷的手，你决定这个值，你决定你的意图和位置，系统确认你的存在和能力，从它那里你可以获得你喜欢的任何东西。</p>
<p>K: it is very hard but generally easy. It needs the truth and the balance between the blood and the neuro connection of the man and his intention, true intention. You put your hand in there and your intention is the food to feed the nation and the nation’s food will be in the power of your hand and with your wish will feed the nation. This is how you are going to create matter state. I want to build a structure where I can live on this planet. You wish and you create the condition of the plasma and all this water, gans and matter is in the way to start giving you the self confidence that you can tap into the universal energy and make whatever you like. It is the interim step. Some of you will become masters of it. Some of you won’t understand it and will become slaves to it.<br>凯史：它非常困难，但是通常也容易，它需要真实以及人的血液与神经连接之间的平衡，他的意图，真实的意图。你把你的手放在这里，你的意图是食物去供养国民，那么这国民食物的力量就在你的手中，满足你供养国民的意愿。这就是你如何去创造物质状态。我将去创建一个结构，这样我可以生活在这个星球上，你会梦想成真，你创造了等离子体的条件，这些水，甘斯和物质开始给于你自我信任的道路，你可以接入宇宙的能量，创造任何你喜欢的。它是暂时的阶段，你们一些人将成为这样的大师。你们那些不能理解它的人将成为它的奴隶。</p>
<p>K: the process is extremely easy and you have done all of it. In two years I have taken you from post to post and I made sure as much knowledge was given in different forms and you will see the effect of it. We have how you want to see the field of it. There is a small video that was part of yesterday’s agricultural teaching. It has been sent for us for you to see. The purpose of this, you might look in the matter state of it. But, it shows the effect of the fields on the matter according to the wish and understanding of the condition. This is a presentation from Australia. (1.53.35 minutes). Is John there in the background to speak it through? Transcript from 121st Knowledge Seekers Workshop held July 14, 2016 (v1 2016-07-24) DRAFT (Transcription has not been verified. Double check info with video) 21<br>凯史：这个过程极其容易，你已经结束了所有关于它的学习。在两年的时间内，我带领你们从这里到这里，我确信同样的知识已经不拘形式地传授给你们，你将看到它的效率。我们有你想看到的它的场体。这是一个小视频，是昨天农业教学的一部分。它已经被传送过来给你们观看。这个目的是，你可以观察到它的物质状态。但是，它展示了这个场体的效果在物质上取决于你的愿望和对这个状况的理解。这是一个来自澳大利亚的展示。(1.53.35 minutes)。是约翰在背景里讲话吗？{视频不清楚的地方的记录}<br>K: you see in the next few minutes how we can even effect the vegetation instantly in such a short time. It is another condition of life. Then you can imagine how fast you can do this.<br>凯史：你看见在接下来的几分钟，我们如何，甚至在如此短的时间内立即产生植物的植被。它是另外一个生命的条件。然后，你可以想象你也可以如此快地做到这个。</p>
<p>John (J): Food shelf Life with Plasma Water Compare the shelf life of Micro radish grown in water and plasma water. • We soaked the new batch of radish seed in plain water and soaked the batch of seeds in CO2 and CH3 plasma water for 24 hours. • Both were seeded into plain coco fiber and left to germinate. • During the next 7 days each batch was watered respectively with the plain water and the plasma water. • Both batches were harvested on the same day and packaged. (Pictures of the plants at 1.55.52 minutes). J: we cut them at the 2 leaf stage. As you can see the one on the bottom left is the plasma seed and the one the right was plain water. At this stage they were exactly the same and we saw no difference. What we noticed was a difference in the root structure. The radish watered with plain water had a weaker root structure compared to the plasma water radish. Once we had cut and washed the radish and we planted them. I took photographs of several days.<br>约翰：食物的保质期与它们在等离子体水中的保质期的比较，小萝卜在等离子体水中的生长与在普通水中的比较。我们把一批萝卜籽浸入淡水，另一批浸入CO2和CH3混合的等离子体水中24小时。两者同时播种到椰子壳纤维中去使它们发芽。间隔7天分别给各自浇灌淡水和等离子体水。两批在同一天收割和包装。（照片展示在1.55.52分钟）。<br>约翰：我们收割它们在叶子发育的第二阶段。你可以看到在瓶子底部左边的是等离子水处理的种子，右边的是普通水处理的种子，目前它们的状态是完全一样的，我们没有看到不同。我们注意到它们的不同在于根系结构，浇灌淡水的萝卜根系比浇灌等离子体水的萝卜的根系更弱，一旦我们收获它们洗净并种植它们，我几天后可以取得它们的照片。</p>
<p>K: let me stop you and ask you the question I asked you yesterday. When normally you cut this radish in the normal situation, and you have farmed for 3 years with this, what is the shelf life of the product?<br>凯史：让我们暂停一下，我想问你一个昨天问过的问题。当你在正常条件的情况下收获这些种子，你已经种植这个三年了，这个产品的保质期是多久？</p>
<p> J: generally with the trials we have done, we put a label that says ‘fourteen day.’ Our own trials gave us a shelf life of 15 days. It’s a shelf life of 10 days in the retail stores. This is the way we have done this for 3 years. You see the pictures after 9 and then 14 days and there was very little change. Then we have a picture of 20 days and we saw very little change. The bottom picture is day 28 and again we had not seen a change in the radish. Then I have a pictured of day 41 and we see a bit of yellowing of some of the leaves on both the water and the plasma side. At this stage there was a slight odor coming from the water only radish and not the plasma. In the bottom picture you see more yellowing. As I have said we have been growing this for 3 years and we have seen very little last after 15 days. At that time we see a lot of rot setting in and we end up with a lot of liquid at the bottom. If Transcript from 121st Knowledge Seekers Workshop held July 14, 2016 (v1 2016-07-24) DRAFT (Transcription has not been verified. Double check info with video) 22 you open these containers there is a horrendous smell that fills the room very quickly. The smell is given off when the plant cells break down and it’s a sulfur ‘rotten egg’ smell. On day 41 we smelled a slight odor and it was more of a vegetation odor. It wasn’t the funny stinky smell from before. We had seen the yellowing on the leaves. On the first day we weighed the containers and both weight 47 grams with the radish. On day 41 I weighted them again and they were still 41 grams so we lost very little over this time. We kept them in the refrigerator at 4 degrees Celsius. J: what we got from this was that the shelf life or refrigerator life of your food can be extended way beyond its normal time by using the plasma water to grow the food in. The big question I had was why the radish watered with the plain water lasted as long as the plasma water. What we realized then was they had been sitting next to each other when we soaked the seeds in the water, we put a container of water next to the plasma water container and they sat there for 24 hours. We put them together on the tables to grow and the containers were next to each other for 47 days in the refrigerator. So the fields from the plasma radish were interacting with the water only radish. Essentially it is the stronger fields feeding the weaker fields and the plain water radish lasted just as long. J: Implication we found was could we place CO2, ZnO, amino acid plasma water in our fridges at home to extend the life of the fresh produce we buy from the store? Can we place the plasma water in the store shelves to extend the life of produce in the store?<br>约翰：一般的试验我们已经完成，我们在标签上注明的是“十四天”，我们给自己定的保质期是十五天。它在零售商店的保质期是10天。三年以来我们就是这么做的。你看见的照片是9天以后的，然后是14天以后的，它们变化很小。下面的照片是28天以后再次拍摄的，我们没有看到种子有很大的变化。然后我有一张41天的照片，我们看到等离子体水浇灌的那组和淡水浇灌的那组都仅仅是叶子有一点点变黄，目前有一些轻微的气味是来自于淡水浇灌组而不是等离子体水浇灌组。下面的照片你看到叶子变黄更多。如我所说，我们经营这个已经三年了，很少看到保质期能够超过15天大情况，那时我看到根系开始生长，而我们已经结束了对其根部的浇灌。{视频不清楚的注释}。你打开这个包装，一股可怕的气味迅速充满整个房间，当植物的细胞坏掉的时候会发出难闻的气味，就像是“臭鸡蛋”的硫的味道。在41天的时候我们闻到轻微的气味，更多的是植物的味道，而不是像以前那样发出恶臭。我们还是看到叶子正在变黄。第一天我们称两组种子的重量都是47克，到41天的时候，它们仍然还有41克重，所以，在这些时间内我们失去很少的重量。通常我们延长食物的保质期的方法是我们把它们放到摄氏4度的冰箱里保存，用等离子体水去浇灌的食物会超过它们正常的保质时间。我有一个很大的问题是，为什么萝卜用等离子体水浇灌和用淡水浇灌的同时都延长那么长的保质时间？凯史：我们意识到的是当我们在水中浸泡这些种子的时候它们彼此一直放在互相接近的地方，我们把它们放入培养箱的时候，淡水箱紧挨着等离子水箱，它们放在一起24小时，我们把它们放到同一个桌子上去栽培，容器在冰箱内又彼此靠近47天，所以，来自等离子体萝卜的场体对淡水萝卜的场体产生了作用，本质上是较强的场体供养较弱的场体，淡水萝卜才能延长那么长的保质时间。杰克：你暗示我们可以把CO2, ZnO,氨基酸等离子体液体放到冰箱里面去延长我们从商店买回来的生鲜产品的保质期？我们也可以把等离子体液体放到商店里去延长产品的保质期？</p>
<p>K: thank you very much for the presentation. This has far more implication than you can think but is in line with what we thought. You have seen the vegetation which has not even come in touch with the water receives the field of the water. You do not need to be in the field to have the beneficial effects of the field. This is the transmutation of energy through the gans and for the first time can clearly be seen. The more you see the more you understand that the fields do not need the matter state. It receives what it needs to be equal to the others and this will apply to the man and the universal community from now on. We have the two next to each other according to the wish of the Creator; man shall elevate the standing of the Universal Community.<br>凯史：非常感谢你的展示。这里面有多得多的暗示，然后你可以去思考，但是看我们从哪方面去思考。你看到植物像那样甚至没有接触也可以接受来自水的场体，你不需要存在场体中也可以获得场体的有益的效果。这是通过甘斯的能量的演变，首先看到的是可以使场体清晰，其次你看到更多，你理解这个场体不需要物质状态。它从其他场体接受的等于是它自身需要的，从现在起这将适用于人类和宇宙社区。我们有两个互相靠近的，取决于造物者的意愿，人类将提升并立于宇宙社区。</p>
<p>K: The time of transition will be very hard; there will be those that want to stop the process for their own physical misconduct not to be shown. My condolences because you are too late. You took the life of a young man; we take your kingship. And we have taken your kingship. Transcript from 121st Knowledge Seekers Workshop held July 14, 2016 (v1 2016-07-24) DRAFT (Transcription has not been verified. Double check info with video) 23 You took the position to stop the process last Thursday and you gave us more (information) to see your weaknesses. Now we explain it very easily. Your time is over. The bell rang on the 12th and today is the 14th. Please, if you are true men of peace and you have been asking for equality and peace on this planet, I cannot teach any more until you reach the understanding of this universe and then we shall meet again. We bring you into the Universal community and that means another education.<br>凯史：转变的时期将非常困难，这将是那些想要为他们自己的物质的不当行为而停止这个进程的人的借口。我为你们哀悼，因为你们太迟了。你夺取一个年轻人的生命，我们拿掉你的君主身份。我们获得你的王位。{视频不清的纪录}你认为停止这个进程最迟到周四，你给我们更多的信息让我们看清楚你的劣势。现在我们解释它非常的容易，你的时间已经完了，倒计时钟声在12号响起，而今天是14号。请，如果你是真实的和平的人，你可以平等的请求和平在这个星球上，我不能教你更多直到你达到这个宇宙的认识，然后我们将再次相会。我们带领你进入宇宙社区，那意味着另外的教育。</p>
<p>K: What you have and what I have told you and what you will learn and you will add is enough to bring you out and to be equal and for you to be able to develop this in a very rapid way so that we can change the course of the war mongering on this planet. And, it is well known by those who show their two fingers that I have always been successful in bringing the fingers together. I always delivered where I appear and I know exactly how to deliver. In so many ways man has no choice. Our wish is for peace and we will go to the end to achieve it. We expect the apology from those who planned the murder of Fabio. And we will not do it by words but will bring it to their souls. We expect the same for those who are planning revolutions and evolutions around this planet. We deliver so much that you have no room to just submit your physicality to the eventuality of the imprisonment of the souls you murdered.<br>凯史：你拥有什么，我已经告诉过你，你将学习什么，你将添加的是足够带领你出去，去成为平等的存在，为你能够以非常快的方法去发展这个。所以那样我们可以去转变在这个星球上好战者的历程。以及，众所周知的，那些出示他们两根手指的人（共济会？）我总是能够成功地同时逮住他们的手指。我总是出现在我该在的地方，我知道如何精确地传递。在很多方面那人没有选择。我们的愿望是为了和平，我们将一直进行直到彻底实现它。我们期待来至那些策划谋杀法比奥的人的道歉。我们不用语言来做这个，但是将带它进入他们的灵魂。我们同样期待那些围绕这个星球策划革命和进化的人。我们传递了那么多，然而你没有进步你只是服从你的肉体去扩张灵魂的监狱，你是谋杀犯。</p>
<p>K: If any of you as world leaders decide to commit suicide and not be seen in the truth of your soul, don’t forget the physicality does not count. We have access to your soul. You committed many crimes and now we have opened the hand of the universe. Those who came here to teach you and got interacted and battled by their what I call the losses of life on this planet, they in turn have to return to be positioned in where they have to be to understand that will not repeat itself anywhere across the universe. Taking of the physical life is as bad as taking the soul of the man. You know how to handle it, you have in a way, you have seen the lettuce and you have seen the radish, one bucket is your system and one bucket which has never received the energy is the man who is hungry, has a broken leg, you bring it to his wishes to be comforted in the condition of his existence and that is what your job shall be.<br>凯史：如果你们任何人像世界的领导人那样决定自杀，那不是你的灵魂的真相，不要忘记，肉体是没有价值的。我们应用你的灵魂。你犯下了许多罪行，现在，我们张开宇宙的手。那些来到这里教化你们却被你们在这个星球上处死的，他们反过来又不得不再次回到这里，他们明白必须让这种事情在这个宇宙中的任何地方不再发生这种事情。为肉体生命去伤害人类的灵魂是恶劣的。你知道如何去处理它，你有一个方法，你看生菜，你看萝卜，一个水桶就是你的系统，一个水桶决不接受人的能量，谁是饥饿的，腿是骨折的，在它的存在的条件下你带给他安慰，那将会是你的工作。</p>
<p>K: Maybe we have enough time to change before it is too far and too late but on the other hand we have no choice. You have messed up your planet too far and too long and those who came to give a hand stood as bystanders and that was not supposed to be when they were here to transfer. They became embedded in the societies that started the wrong doing and they started abusing. As I said there will be no one who shall be called the Jew as we finish with Moses and demote his station as a prophet to an ordinary man as he has not delivered Transcript from 121st Knowledge Seekers Workshop held July 14, 2016 (v1 2016-07-24) DRAFT (Transcription has not been verified. Double check info with video) 24 what he was supposed to. There shall be no prophet called Moses. He has committed nothing but murder and his followers still carry on the same. So there shall be no Jews. With it came the price and the same structure of Mohammed. So we finish with the religions as if you know the knowledge of the universe. You are the man of religion yourself you need no guidance but the correct conduct of your emotion and your soul and the rest is history.<br>凯史：也许我们还有足够的时间去作出转变，在它太早或者太迟之前，但是，在其他的手上，我们没有选择。你困惑，你的星球如此遥远如此漫长。你们那些人就像旁观者一样垂着手站在那里，当他们在这里教化的时候你本不该如此。他们成了嵌入社会的错误，他们开始虐待。就像我说过的，这里没有一个人配被叫做犹太人，他们已经结束了与摩西的关系，他们降低他的身份，使一个先知就像一个凡人{视频不清的纪录}他本应该被期待的，这里没有先知被叫做摩西，他只不过是杀人犯，他的追随者也是一样的。所以这里没有犹太人。默罕默德的组织结构与它的价格是一样的。所以我们结束宗教，如果你知道这个宇宙的知识。你是你自己的宗教的人你不需要指导，只要你有正确的情感行为和你的灵魂，都是众所周知的。</p>
<p>K: if you don’t understand this now that we open the door of the universe to you, every ‘Tom, Dick and Harry’ of space become prophets because they see the weaknesses inside. You have the knowledge that you received to be able to be the creator of what you wanted and what you want and what you have as long as it is in equal terms and conditions and it is for the benefit for the totality and not the individuality. So the question is very simple. As we have finished and I warned before with the mess that has come with the others who used the name of the religions and the path of belief to receive and abuse the others, now we finish with the kingship who was there to say that one is higher than the other and it has to come to an end. In trying to keep the position of the higher they have brought the abuses in the name of the religion next to them to give themselves credibility and some have mixed it together to be as strong as they wanted to be.<br>凯史：如果你不明白这个，现在我们为你打开这扇宇宙的大门，成为太空的先知非常的“汤姆，迪克和哈里”，因为他们看见内在的弱点。你有这个知识，你能够成为你想要的事物的创造者，你想要什么就会得到什么，条件是那是符合整体的利益而不是个体的利益。所以，问题非常简单，正如我们已经完成，我警告在即将来到的混乱之前，谁使用其他的宗教的名义，通过信仰的途径虐待别人的，现在我们结束这个王权身份，谁在那里说那一个高于另外一个，它必须走到尽头。设法去维持高于他人的地位，他们借用宗教的名义去给与他们自己塑造可信性，一些人混在一起使他们更强大，他们想要这样。</p>
<p>第五部分笔译——刁义芬</p>
<p>K: we see this mixture in the structure in the UK where the king and the faith have gone together to create more murders than anybody else. We are finished with this island. As they said there was an unsinkable ship (titanic) we have sunk the ship. It is very simple—why should one be higher than the other and why should than one soul be higher than the other in the physical strength when at the soul level they are equal? There shall be no king and there shall be no presidents. When you are in deep space who is your president from earth except you? Understand the word of the ambassador. The ambassador speaks to the diplomat and tells you one thing: I am the representative of my king, my president and I speak in his word and in his place. That is what the ambassador is and now that we have opened the universe to you and you are all ambassadors or this planet. You speak the soul of this planet and you speak the word of humanity. That is why you are one nation, one planet and one race.<br>凱史：我們看到在英國最近由皇室跟宗教所造成的混亂比任何人都要多。讓我們來終結這個島嶼好了。它們老說自己是永遠不會沉的船，我們來讓他們沉沒好了，這個很簡單做。為什麼他們總永遠是高高在上呢?為何在人的物理身體裡面會有靈魂高低之分呢?其實他們都是一樣的。在哪裡沒有所謂的國王，也沒有所謂的總統。當你在太空深處若只有你一個人時，誰又是你地球上的總統呢?了解大使這個名詞嗎?一個大使在跟外交官說話，只能算是告訴你一件事，我現在就是我自己的國王，我自己的總統，我正說他的話，我就是在他的位置上這就是所謂的大使，現在我們打開宇宙社會給你，你們都是這個星球的大使，你在為這個星球的靈魂說話，你在為所有的人類種族發聲，這就是一個國家，一個星球，一個種族的真正含意了。</p>
<p>K: it is very simple—you did not understand and now we force you to understand that shall be no king. There shall be no leaders because in leadership and positioning the leadership we have to force conditions that abuse. In this case we need no world leaders. It takes times to change the course, but this time will be very, very short. I hope man will not take revenge by what they have done wrong to him by those who have done wrong to him. Do not burn  25 the cities. The biggest sorrow for me for years has been when evolution and revolution come; people destroy what are their own national assets to show their anger. It is you who loses. It is the building which you built by your sweat of your ancestors. There are some buildings that have to be brought to the ground that man who forget about the wrong things that happened in that space because on the other hand you can create the conditions in a way to place it in the center of these buildings no man will see the building without destroying it that does not bring the emotion and the losses in that building. This is the Buckingham Palace, the White House and the rest of it.<br>凱史：這個道理非常簡單。如果你還不懂，那我就說道你懂。這裡沒有國王，這裡沒有領導，因為在領導或是領導這個位置，是武力濫用的結果，所以在這個立基點上，我們是沒有所謂的世界領袖這件事，他是去要時間去進化的課程，可是時間實在是太太太少了，我希望人們不要對這樣曾經傷害自己的人產生報復心理，﹏，這些年來我感受到最大的悲傷就是看到因為革命，其實就是人們因為憤怒而摧毀他們自己國家的建設與資產，其實因為憤努所做的行為，最後損失的還是自己。這些建築不就是我們可敬的祖先的蓋的嗎?有些建築美麗到讓人們忘記曾在這顆星球所做的錯事，換句話說，我們能創造一種方式以這些美麗建築為中心，讓人們沒有看到因為破壞而帶來的情緒與挫折。比如像白金漢宮，白宮，等等類似其他這樣的地方。</p>
<p>K: The only places which have to be flattened in a way have to be brought back to the position because they abused many souls of those who sat at the center of the abuses of man of the world villages. They have been nothing but the shame on the face of the universal community and what we gave the message to come for the improvement and the development of the man became the point of the abuse of the man. They were murderers and everything else they could put out. We don’t open that book because in so many ways our messengers got themselves entangled in the physicality of their lives. My job is done; I have accomplished and delivered.<br>凱史：唯一要重整的理由就是這些濫權中心的人們，他們在這個地球村上利用職權蹂躪許多人的靈魂。在宇宙社會裡面，它們將為自己的罪刑而感到恥辱，這是因為我們得到來自更發達文明的訊息，且針對這群濫權中心的人們，他們是一群謀殺者，而且壞事做盡。我們不再開放註記，因為我們的訊息傳遞者，正為它們自己的地球身體而糾纏著，我的工作已經完成，我達成了，也把訊息送到了。</p>
<p>K: now it is your turn as one race to deliver the peace to this planet. Build as many systems as you can and do not go for revenge but go to elevate that they cannot sustain the elevation. Then in that way their energy and their souls become part of the universal soup and nonexistent. In a way the demise of a soul comes when it cannot find the place to call home and in spreading to find home it becomes lost in the soup of the universal. It is annihilation in the essence of the fields of the universe. Any questions?<br>凱史：現在是換你們了，作為一個種族是該換你們把訊息傳遞到這個星球的每個地方了。盡可能地去建造更多的系統，而不是為了去報復，而是去建造更高的位階，而這個高的標準是無法再繼續去支持他們去壞事的境界。這樣他們的能量與靈魂就會變成這個宇宙能量湯的一部分而永不復存在。當他們找不到所謂家的地方時，或是在他們轉換的過程中就會迷失在宇宙的能量湯裡面。這就是在宇宙中，本質上真正的滅絕。還有任何問題嗎？</p>
<p>Y: I am not sure and I was a bit confused about which device we will build. Will it be the two balls, one inside the other, or the one with the moving parts?<br>Y：我有點不確定，而且有些糊塗了，關於我們建立的設備，他是要兩個球嗎?一邊是一個，另一個是在轉動的那個嗎?</p>
<p>K: the balls are irrelevant. They can both move but the position is that you can concentrate the fields of the free plasma you have created. I have given this example a few times. You want to test it because you understand it and it gives you confidence and you know what you have. What you have to do is this: get yourself a mixer. Nano coat it or use a copper wire nano coat. You will see a strange effect and teach yourself this story—if you put this nano coated copper on a mixing machine you will see a very strange effect. Bernie are you there in the background? Explain to us what happened when you do this. Explain to us the nano coated wire in the gans plasma.  26 Bernie (B): Yes, when I spin the nano –coated copper at a certain speed it bends 90 degrees. I think it is around 500 rpm.<br>凱史：兩個球是沒有關係的。兩個球都可以轉動，而他們的場強還是為你對於自由等離子體的關注而決定的。我以前有給過類似的例子，你會想測試它，也是因為你開始了解它了，而且它也給了你足夠的信心，而且你知道你在心中領悟到的。而現在你要做的是，給自己做一個組合器，奈米它們，或是用一個銅線圈，奈米它，你會看到場強的作用，然後用這樣的方式在引導自己去學習，如果你放了一個奈米過的銅線圈在組合的機器中，你會看到很強的場域的作用力，伯尼你在後台嗎?給我們解釋一下吧?當你做這樣的組合時，發生了甚麼事?解釋一下這個奈米銅圈在甘斯等離子體的情況。<br>伯尼：當我轉動這個奈米銅現實當它彎成90度時，我相信它的轉數達到500轉。</p>
<p>K: so what happened is that this butterfly wire instead of horizontal becomes vertical. (2.20.32 minutes) B: the whole stand shifted to the side. But it is like the drawing and it is 90 degrees and that is unusual for that to happen.<br>凱史：所以我們看到這個美麗的銅線圈代替子午線變成了垂直運轉。<br>伯尼：它是整個移到這邊，感覺上像是用畫畫的，而且它轉到90度也是很不尋常的事。</p>
<p>K: don’t forget the material is nano-coated. It is in the gans water, so the field forces because it is together and creates a new condition. This is exactly what you did with the coils. If you remember the coils which were built for medical application sit at 90 degrees inside each other. It is the point of the transformation of the plasma speed. It is the only way I could teach you this. What you need now is to create the space for the change and what you do in you coils, at this point, you create space for it so it can interact on its own. And you will see you still have the butterfly to stir the fields inside (2.22 minutes) but you keep on concentrating the energy inside. This still rotates, but it is the fields twisting. It is very much like the change of the planets. The field forces change position and now you have a place to confine your field forces and this is the energy field which you need. (2.22.32 minutes).<br>凱史：別忘了這些物質是要奈米的， 它們是在甘斯水裡面。因為場強的力量，因為匯聚而創造了新的條件。你這樣做是剛剛好的，如果你還記得的話，這些線圈是為了健康醫療而製作的，所以裡面都是呈現90度，這也是等離子體速度傳導的角度，這也是目前我唯一可以教給你的，也是你需要去創造一個新的條件的太空環境，這個環境的也是用你所製作的線圈改變的，在這個點上，你所創造的太空環境它們可以自己交互作用。你會看到你會一直有很漂亮的擾場運作，但是你要一直保持對這個能量的關注喔!這裡還在旋轉，你有個場在這裡盤旋。這個跟星球的運作非常相似。場的力量改變了位置，這個新的地方侷限了這個場的力量，它就是一個能量場，而且也是你需要的。</p>
<p>K: If you still place this in another ball with the same condition in the liquid plasma, then have as many holes as you like in your ball. You don’t need to be air tight, not even here. (2.22.49 minutes). You gave it a frame. You are within the structure so what you can do is now the liquid plasma is continually feeding the two fields and what you will receive is very simple. In a way if you look at it, you make as many holes as possible in your ping pong ball. If you nano coated this ball before you put it there it does not matter how many holes you created. The fields will create the same condition. You can always take the ball away. This is your center ball and you can create a bigger ball and then you have two fields. Understand where this comes from and don’t accept it just because we said so.<br>凱史：如果你繼續在這個地方放一個條件相同的球，裡面也加了等離子體水， 然後就能產生一個洞在你的球裡面，你根本就不需要把封閉空氣，這裡也是，你給了一個架構，在這個結構中，你可以有一個新的等離子體的流動，而且可以不斷地補充這兩個場的能量，你得到的非常簡單，你如果有看到它們這樣的方式，你盡可能的製造更多的洞在你的乒乓球裡面，你在放置他們之前先奈米它們，你就把它們都擺上，也不用在意到底能製造多少的洞。場的創造，它們的條件都是一樣的。因為你隨時可以把球取下，在中心的位置，你可以放個大一點的球，這樣你就會有兩個場域了，請了解它們的來源出處，不要只是聽我們說。</p>
<p>K: you remember you had the CO2, the CuO2, the CH3, and you put these gans of liquid plasma in the container and you got all three properties of it in every part of it because they got loaded on one plasma where this is one, another and another all on the back of the same fields. (2.24.33 minutes). Now you have the same position with the mixer and with adding and stirring it you add to each of those properties where they are loaded on the plasma. And you add to this and you increase the power of the plasma. This is how in the universe we  27 make the start of neutrons. It is by the speed of the rotation. This is why the earth in comparison to the sun even if it looks smaller moves faster and the electrons around protons create its field absorption. There is nothing new. J: so we are actually creating a plasma right?<br>凱史：你是否記得，當你有了三種甘斯，CO2，CUO，CH3，你放了這些等離子體液態甘斯，在容器裡，你就有了三種性能在每個區域，它可以負載一個，兩個，還有另一個同樣的場體，現在你也有了相同的條件，因為混和了這三種甘斯，同時也增加了它們自己的力量，還有彼此擾動的力量。你增加了他們各自的性能，它們也能下載自己的等離子體，而你不但增加他們，而且你也為它們創造了等離子體運作的力量。這就是在宇宙中，中子開始轉換的過程。它是根據轉動的速度而定，這也是太陽跟地球之間的對照，雖然他們看起來傳動得更快，就像電子在圍繞著質子轉動的時候所創造的屬於自己脈衝的場體，其實這也不是甚麼新的知識。<br>J：所以我們事實上就是在創造等離子體，是嘛?</p>
<p>K: 3 plasmas. That was the whole teaching. You missed it. Wake up! J: I know it is the teaching and I need to understand how to use this free plasma. For example do I have to have 3 of those to produce lift? Would I need 4 plasmas?<br>凱史：三個等離子體。這個是所有教學的關鍵，你錯過了，醒醒。J：我知道它們阿!我只是想知道它們是如何運作的，例如說：我創造了它們三種的生命，我需要去創造第四個嗎? </p>
<p>K: you can still do it with one; just change your ping pong ball to a chair. And put the energy underneath it. You can still create it. What you saw with Armin on the metal side you can create a matter state frequency on what you call the hertz. If you understood why we put a metal piece in the core, in a very simple way and part of the teaching in the past, we thought that whenever to wanted to change the energy from direct to alternative all you need to is to scratch the nano-coating and in the matter state the field has to find the passage through the gaps in the Magrav spacing of the copper and this creates isolation. In a way it tries to get through the hole and it vibrates until it is empty. This is exactly how you get spasms in an epileptic attack. There is no difference in an epileptic attack and what you call the hertz in the matter state as the energy transfer.<br>凱史：你可以持續去做，只是你要改變你的乒乓球的底座，然後把能量放進去，你就可以持續的創造它，你看到阿曼放在金屬旁邊，你也可以感受到所謂物質狀態的頻率，就是我們所說的赫茲。如果你明白為什麼我們要放一個金屬片在角落，這也是我們過往的教學的部分，我們了解不管這幾種方式你做甚麼樣的選擇，你要做的是刮掉一點奈米塗層，你就會看到有些能量會在物質狀態的場域中，自己會去找到通道在銅線圈中，去補充原子間的空隙，這樣的創造是獨立完成的，只要球中仍保持有洞的狀態，他們也試圖的想穿越那個洞，裡面是空的，就會持續震動，這就好像我們癲癇發作時一樣，這裡癲癇就如同我們說得關於物質狀態的赫茲是一樣的，能量就是這樣傳輸的。</p>
<p>K: a lot of you who have been working around this technology, now you have the freedom and my only wish is before you get involved in making energy and feeding yourself first of all use this new knowledge to bring peace to mankind as fast as possible. Then you will find that you have already fed your soul. Use those of you who have been looking for world peace and talking about peace, peace comes when the emotion is in satisfaction and balance with its physicality. The man who is a king and orders a murder is still a father and loves his child. They both exist. If you satisfy and show him would you like to murder your own child? He will understand the pain of it. He will understand in elevating the level of his soul that it will not happen.<br>凱史：有大部分你們都正在實驗這個科技，我更希望你們能將把和平盡快地帶給人類這樣的心念放在前提，然後來運作這些能量層，之後你會發現，其實你的靈魂已經先被餵養了。和平的願力來自於我們的情緒體已經得到滿足而且跟我們的身體取得了一個平衡狀態，才能真正地被展現，那位國王雖然做了謀殺的命令，但他也是別人的父親，也愛他的孩子，這些腳色全部集於一身，如果你能接受這樣的狀態，是否你就同意他來謀殺你的孩子呢?他總有一天會發現這樣的疼，如果有天他到達他靈性的階層，就會了解，可是他永遠到不了。</p>
<p>K: Many times in my talks I have said to look at the picture of the President of the United States, Barack Obama. Watch him for the term of his presidency and until the day he had to sit and order the murder or other man, whatever name they put on the man, the woman and the child. He took his soul and a soul was given and the face of the man changed and it aged rapidly. When you know you cannot take why do you go and take? Then your physicality pays for your emotion. You have to understand that you have two choices: do what I did and send them back to their own virtual prison of themselves. Or elevate them that they  28 cannot stand the elevation and they become part of the universal soup. And the best thing with the human race is both, but in the sequence of one to another. Don’t be so busy with having your free energy, free flight system; be so busy that if you manage to bring peace, this technology the way it has been taught this morning you have already flown for millions of years in the span of the universe and now you increase the level of the soul of the planet that it becomes part of and equal strength of the universal community<br>凱史：以前在我很多次的談話中，我曾說過，我們來看看美國總統歐巴馬，在他的任期期間，不管他對誰，不管今天是男人、女人、或是小孩。只要他做了謀殺的決定，他都讓他的靈魂受傷，同時受傷的靈性也會回饋他，讓這個人面對自己的變化，外表就會顯得快速老化.。當你知道你自己無法承受時，那為何當初還要去做，或是掠奪呢?然後你的肉體就會為你的情緒付出代價。此時人們就面臨了兩種決定:是讓他們繼續做壞事，讓他們繼續痛苦在自己虛擬的監獄中，還是想法提升它們的靈魂呢?但事實上已經很難幫他們做到了，因為它們已經成為宇宙能量湯的一部分了。這兩種狀況對於人類種族來說，都是好的。但是這都不是我們要浪費能量的地方，我們要專注的是，如何把和平但給人類，並且好好想想，今天早晨透過教學，我們對於飛行這件事，在宇宙間，我們已經跨越了百萬年，現在是輪到我們要提升我們在屬於這個星球的靈魂的品質，因為我們的靈魂已經成為宇宙社群中的一部分了。</p>
<p>K: my purpose is not to take you into the universal community as individuals. The job is to take the humanity, the planet as a whole and as one entity and it means that you all have to work to bring everything in balance the way you want it as peace so that elevation of the soul of the planet is achieved. Look at the pictures on one planet, one nation. It is the planet that the man carries in his hand in respect to the universal community and not the man himself. This is what we explained and a lot of you have missed it. If you are busy over the power generator and the free energy unit and needing a pen for the pain, now you have everything you want; it is the magic box of the universe and it opened. (2.31.46 minutes). That is it; from now to the point of understanding other universes and their operation we have given you enough knowledge. It is you who have to test it, unravel it, walk it and deliver it.<br>凱史：我的目標不是僅僅把你們以為這只是個人的事，帶入宇宙社會。這是為整體人類而做的，這個星球就是一個整體，他是一個完整的個體，真正的涵義是你要讓你生命中的每件事情都要達到平衡，如果你要在這個星球上對於你的靈魂，能在和平的心境上達到一個平衡，而且真正達到。我們整體的來看一下，這個一個星球，一個國家的概念。這代表著人們會用尊重每個人的態度來對待宇宙社會，而不是只是對於人與人之間而已，這也是我們之前一再解釋的，也是被你們一直忽略的部分。如果你今天一直忙於做發電機，希望能擁有自由能源，身體疼痛時有個筆可以幫你解決痛苦，那你應該不缺任何事情了，它就是一個在宇宙中的魔術盒子，而它現在被打開了，應該不是只有這樣吧!從現在起，我們要從其他宇宙的角度來對待了，我們給了你們足夠的知識去擁有這些，這些都是你自己去測試的結果，請去解釋它，去運用它，去分享它。</p>
<p>K: my advice to all of you, anyone who listens, if you have been claiming we want peace and there is no peace on this planet in any shape or form, build the system and your first intention is not for free energy or the lift, but peace on this planet. You have to elevate the soul of the planet before you all receive what you desire. And this is what is important; a lot of you even from the first question you asked were how do we create the lift? There wasn’t a question on how do we achieve peace. Man is still too materialistic. And this is your problem because you always want to have it and when you were given it, you fought so long to have it that you forgot the rules of humanity. Dr. A.:<br>凱史：我現在對於每一個現在在聽我說話的人，給一個忠告，如果你要求我們要和平，很抱歉在這個星球上和平是不會實現的，當你開始建造這些系統時，你第一個注意到的不是自由能源，或是生活，除了把和平帶給這個星球之外，你若要讓你所有成真之前，你必須先提升你的靈性，那麼甚麼才是重要的呢?你們都會問到這個問題，我們要向和平進程其實不是問題，我們可以做到，問題是，我們太唯物主義了，這才是你們真正的問題，你們總是對喜歡的事情要擁有它，或是為了擁有而戰爭太久了，以至於忘了身為人類的準則。</p>
<p>第六部分笔译——Fanjiaxin</p>
<p>K: let me explain, Dr. A. is from the United States and is a dentist and is on our medical calls. Dr. A: I have two questions: one is that you said Moses slaughtered a lot of people and then you are from the line of Moses. Does it mean that you can correct it?<br>凯史:让我解释一下，A.博士来自美国，是一位牙科医生，现在正连线我们的教学。<br>博士：我有两个问题：一是你说摩西屠杀了很多民众，然后你来自摩西的血统，那是否意味着你能纠正他？</p>
<p>K: too late. Dr. A: so you come from Moses’ bloodline, so what does this mean?<br>凯史：太迟了。 A.博士：你来自摩西的血统，这意味着什么？</p>
<p>K: I can only elevate his soul that he will find his own punishment or dimension. Dr. A: the second question is, if I was born for a purpose and you are born and you found and fulfilled your purpose how do I find why I am here? How can I find that?<br>凯史：我仅能提升他的灵魂，他能发现他自己的惩罚和次元。 A.博士：第二个问题，你发现了你降世的目的并履行该目的。如果我的降生是有目的的，我怎样才能知道我为什么在这里？</p>
<p>K: you don’t look at the point of why am I here? The question is how can I serve others? That is why you are here. Dr. A: how can I find my purpose?<br>凯史：你不要关注于我为什么在这里。问题的关键是我怎样才能服务于他人？这是你在这里的原因。 A.博士：我如何发现我人生的目的？</p>
<p>K: your purpose is to serve. Look at the bottom line. The first line of the Keshe website states we are her to serve and not to be served. Then you understand. We are here to give and to elevate the others on the condition of the state of our own being in every direction, shape and form. If you understand that you have matured in the level of humanity. Dr. A: thank you.<br>凯史：你的目的是服务。看看下面几行，第一行是凯史网站申明我们来到这里是服务于人不是被人服务。你就会明白。[不论地区、不论身材、不论种族]，我们都奉献于和提升我们人类。如果你明白这些，你的人性的等级就达到了。A.博士：谢谢。</p>
<p>K: people like Dr. A. understand this if they went through the troubles of the revolution in Iran. They understand every essence and need of the pain. And, pain and suffering brings a lot of wisdom and the wisdom brings a lot of wealth of knowledge of understanding others. Q: message from Clint who sent the space ship reactor 4 picture. It is the same as the double core we saw earlier and it is one blue print structure. (2.36.30 minutes).<br>凯史：经历了伊朗革命的患难，像A.博士：这样的人能明白这些。他们懂得痛苦的本质和需要。痛苦和灾难带给我们很多智慧，智慧带给我们理解他人的知识的财富。Q：克林特发来太空船反应器4的图片信息。它和我们以前看到的双核一样，它是一个蓝图结构。</p>
<p>K: yes this is the final version, more or less. You have to realize there are two coils in this structure and these two are non-nano-coated coils. You need a point of copper because the physical body of the man is heavily connected to the copper so you have a base point and you have a system in the earth condition. If you go to this level you need to find a minimum level and then the comparison and its potential difference in the plasma and the rest in the higher order of the matter. So, you see copper coils that are not nano-coated. In a matter state you can spray the gans of the amino acid only and nothing else on these copper coils for your space travel because then you have physicality and a connection with the amino acid. So when the fields you create for dimensions of your craft have a minimum base which is the amino acid it means the life of the man in space will not be changed. That is the minimum we can bring the system to. This is how you guarantee your space craft in deepest space where the minimum is the existence of the man. And as you see, these are liquid plasmas which are there to create gravitational and magnetical and here this power supply is your plasmatic field used like capacitors. In Armin’s version this does not exist any more (machinery) because you will achieve free rotation.<br>凯史：是的，这或多或少是最终版本。你要知道这个结构中有两个线圈，它们没有纳米涂层。你需要一点铜，因为人的物理身体和铜有很大的连接，你有了一个基点，你有了一个地球环境的系统。如果你想到达这样的水平，你需要找出一个最低水平，找出等离子体和高阶物质间比较和潜在不同。所以，你看到铜线圈没有涂层，你可以喷洒氨基酸甘斯在铜线圈上实现太空旅行，你就有了物理身体和氨基酸的连接。当用氨基酸为飞船创造了磁场，这意味着人的生命在太空不会被改变。这是我们带给这系统的最低要求。这是如何保证你的太空船在深邃的太空保证人活着的最低要求。正如你看到的，这些是液体等离子体，用于创造磁引力场，这电力供应是用于电容器一样的等离子场。在阿曼的版本中，由于能得到自由的旋转，所以动力装置不需要。</p>
<p>K: in a way the ball will hang between the coils and the coils will hold the ball up. If you put a single non-nano coated you will lock it into the matter state. If you understand how to tap into the plasma, compared in a way the potential difference between the matter state and the gans state on the two rings above, and in so many ways the transfer of the fields from the center to any two that you can compare, you will find what you call the flow of the current of the plasma power unit in hundreds of megawatts from a small system like this is very, very easy. If you want to decontaminate an environment or feed people like the disaster today in the floods in China, you don’t need to do anything but position a number of these reactors in the configuration they are. In the center of these you create amino acid strength with the calcium, potassium. If there is an outbreak of certain diseases you make a replication of the disease and you add to it and there are no diseases. You do the same for viruses. You want to feed people with oranges the you provide the energy of the orange in this field (2.41.12 minutes) and the man standing here, if he likes the orange juice and his wish is the orange juice he locks on to the orange juice.<br>凯史：在某种情况下，这球将悬浮于线圈之间，线圈能将球托起来。如果你放单个非涂层线圈，你将把它锁定在物质态。如果你懂得怎样利用等离子体，你可以做个潜在不同的比较，将上面两个线圈分别处在物质态和甘斯态。在这些方法中，场体从中间到其它系统转移，你会发现这些小小的等离子能量单元的数百兆瓦的电流流动是非常容易的。如果你想净化环境或者供养在灾难中的人民，如中国的洪水，你不用做什么，仅仅需要将这些反应器组合成不同的形态，中间创造含有钙、钾的氨基酸场强。如果有疾病爆发，你将疾病复制，然后加入到反应器中，疾病将会消除。病毒也是一样。你想供给大家桔子，你提供桔子的能量到场体中，人站在中间。如果这人喜欢橙汁，他希望得到橙汁，这样，他的意识锁定到橙汁。</p>
<p>K: it is very simple. Now I told you a few weeks ago that field plasma technology is more or less what the man can understand. If you understand then in the future you can interact these fields together, then you will see the beauty of the creator. You opened dimensions and doors into the universal community that you shall all see. But I have very bad news for you, extremely bad news for you. In so many ways all of you because of this condition where everything is kept in the plasma dimension you can see the history of mankind for the past 6000 to 10000 years and who did right and who did wrong and all the falsehood of the history books will come up in no time. Because we can go to the universal archive of the information which has been kept. There is no need to say who did wrong and what was wrong. One of my prime jobs is and will be in the coming days to bring the presence of the soul of the Christ to finish one of the biggest murder machines called the Vatican to an end. This is where the peace shall come. When Christ, blessed his name, shall have you bring his soul presence the servant cannot speak of his abuse. Then we start the peace process.<br>凯史：这是非常简单的。现在我告诉你几周前场等离体科技或多或少被人们知晓了。如果你理解了，在将来，你能让这些场相互作用，你将会看到造物主的美。你打开了进入宇宙社区的空间和门，你也能够看到。但是我有一个非常坏的消息告诉你，特别坏的消息。在很多方面，因为一切保持在等离子体维度，你能看到过去6000到10000年人类历史中，谁做得正确，谁犯了错误，历史书中的谎言将被随时揭穿。因为我们能进入已经被保存的宇宙信息档案馆。没有必要说谁做错了或谁是错的。未来我的主要工作是带着基督的圣灵去结束那最大的被称作罗马教廷的谋杀机器。这样，和平才会到来。当基督，祝福他的名字，让你带着他的圣灵驾到[实行审判]的时候，仆人[怕得]不能够说出他的错误。然后，我们开始了和平进程。</p>
<p>K: if the wish of those of you who are a man of peace wish the presence and the instruction and the truth about, blessed his name, Christ, he shall be present. And then you will tell the truth. Don’t forget the core team of the Keshe Foundation has delivered in elevating the physicality of the soul of the physical part of these messengers from God in the past two weeks. They are ready to deliver. Then you understand how stupid all these wars have been and you realize how the Christians have been abused and played by the Jews in the background. And then the rest is history. How can a man who served humanity cause so much death by his servants? Let the Christ speak and we shall the Vatican Christ.<br>凯史：如果你带着和平愿望，希望基督再来，希望得到指示，渴望真理，祈祷他的名字——基督，他将会来到。你将得到真理。不要忘记凯史基金会的核心团队在过去两周已经向上帝的信使递交了提升物质身体灵性的信息。已经交付了。然后你就会知道战争的愚蠢，你会认识到基督徒被犹太人虐待和玩弄的形势。其它的都众所周知了。一个服务于人类的人怎么会让他的仆人引起如此多的死亡？让基督去说吧，我们将会看到罗马教廷的基督。</p>
<p>K: And then as I said before, go back to my first few teachings. I made you one promise: I will return the stones of Vatican back to where they came from in the center of the room. Where did they come from Giovanni? The stones of the Vatican came from the Coliseum. This is what I promised. You people will take every stone of the Vatican and rebuild the Coliseum because the loss of physicality is much better than the loss of the soul. The abuse of the physical life in the Coliseum has different dimension than those who claim to be the protector of the soul that creates the physicality. So we shall see the end of religions because now you have access to hear from the Creator of the religion and not the servants who abused it. Then, my advice to you is one thing: let the soul of the abusers fit in what we said before.<br>凯史：如我初期的教学所说，我有一个承诺：我会将梵蒂冈的石头归还到它们来自的房间的中心。它们来自于乔瓦尼哪里？这些石头来自于罗马斗兽场。这是我承诺的。你们将拿走梵蒂冈每块石头，重建罗马斗兽场，因为失去身体总比失去灵魂好。罗马斗兽场物理身体的滥用胜过[灵魂的滥用]，他们口口声声说是造物灵魂的保护者。所以，我们将会看到宗教的结束，因为你将有方法收到造物主的信息，而不是滥用者仆人的信息。我有一个建议：让滥用者的灵魂去[接受审判]吧。</p>
<p>K: You understand in these coils in front of you if you can create the position of the gravitational magnetic field of the planet and the condition of the magnetic field of a metal, motion or energy then you can create the gravitational magnetic field of the soul which is somewhere just above the gravitational magnetic field of the amino acid of the man plus zinc. I hope you understand. The mixtures you have to create to be able to reach the levels above the soul is zinc plus. Let me explain to you so you will understand very quickly. (2.47.00 minutes)<br>凯史：你懂得了面前的这些线圈，如果你能创造出星球的磁引力场和金属的磁场、运动或能量，你就能创造出灵魂的磁引力场，它仅仅高于人体氨基酸+锌的磁引力场。我希望你明白，你需要创造的混合物到达灵魂的水平是Zn+。我解释给你，所以你能很快明白。</p>
<p>K: thank you for these; they go as the blue print that you can all use. CONH (amino acid) plus Fe (iron) gives you hemoglobin and in conjunction with Cu (copper) gives you the physicality. The Amino Acid (CONH) with Fe plus Zn (Zinc) gives you the emotion and the brain. CONH with Fe plus Cu = 52-60 ‘energy’ of physicality CONH with Fe plus Zn = 64-63 ‘energy’ of emotion You can see the energy difference between physicality and emotion is very close. And this is what you never understood. It has puzzled me many times, even our doctors. Don’t forget in this part of the CONH plus Fe plus Cu (physicality) all your immune system, all your structure; even your brain has the common denominator of Ca (Calcium) for its structure. The brain has no bone but without it there are no brain cells without the calcium of the skull of the man. The ‘meat’ of the brain has no structure without the calcium in it. The immune system, the T-cells and more, don’t exist if there is no calcium. So you have a backbone. 32<br>凯史：谢谢你的呈现，这些事蓝图，你们可以使用。氨基酸加铁（CONH+Fe）给你血红蛋白，铜给你物质身体。氨基酸和铁加锌给你思想和大脑（CONH+Fe+Zn）。氨基酸和铁加铜（CONH+Fe+Cu）的肉体能量为52~60；氨基酸和铁加锌的精神能量为64-63；你会看到肉体和精神的能量很相近。这是你从来不曾知道的。它迷惑我很多次，甚至我们的医生。别忘记氨基酸和铁加铜（CONH+Fe+Cu）（物质身体），所有你的免疫系统，所有你的结构；大脑和钙有共同的特性。大脑没有骨头，但头盖骨不能没有钙，大脑中没有哪个地方没有钙。如果没有钙，免疫系统、淋巴系统、其它组织将不能存在，所以你有一个脊柱。</p>
<p>K: With the state of the soul you don’t need the calcium. But look at the difference in the energy of the soul and energy of the physicality (52-60 and 64-63). Where do you think the strength of the soul of the man will be? If you manage to create this to change your pain in your body (CONH +Fe+Cu) and if you managed to add this (CONH +Fe+Zn) to your coils and you have seen the change of the emotion my dear friends the soul of the man is now rich in the state of the elements of the universe. It is so simple and if you understand this you can create this and call upon the soul of the Christ and he will tell you what the Vatican is built of—the blood of the man. Let him (the Christ) deliver (the message), not the messengers to color (the message) the way they like.<br>凯史：灵魂的状态不需要钙，看看灵魂和肉体能量的不同(52-60 和 64-63)，你想人体灵魂的能量强度在哪里？如果你试图创造它来减轻身体(CONH +Fe+Cu)的疼痛，你试图增加灵能 (CONH +Fe+Zn)到线圈，你能看到情绪的改变。我的朋友们现在充满于宇宙自然能量。如果你懂得了，它非常简单。你能创造这些，同时唤醒基督意识。他会告诉你梵蒂冈建造于——人类的血液。让基督传递信息，不是信使者随意粉饰。</p>
<p>K: you understand how easy you have gone from physicality into emotion and now you find the mixture which brings the soul into it. And it is in the structure of part of the elements that you have already made the gans of. Don’t forget there is a trick in the game. The muscle tissue has emotion as the brain has. Cu plus Zn plus Soul (2.51.17 minutes)<br>凯史：你理解你从物质体到意识体是多么简单，你发现这灵魂和肉体的结合。它处于自然力部分的结构，你从中制造甘斯。不要忘记游戏中的把戏。肌肉组织和大脑一样有情感。（铜加锌加灵魂。）</p>
<p>K: Now if you understand this not only will you see the Soul of the Christ but you have him virtually with you. Then you will know if he was truly brown eyed or blued eyed. Was he blond or black? So in the system in that core in the center you create the energy of the fields of the soul of the man. And then if your intention is true you will understand that there shall be no light but you shall see through and you will see the soul. There is only light behind that curtain as long as there is interaction difference between the high level of the strength of the fields of the sun and the low levels of the earth in gravitational magnetic. If you create the right field in the right order and when it is all equal there is no light. You see a darkness and you see a very transparent ‘no color’ darkness and you see your soul. And then when the wish is different the light will dictate to you that if my wish is peace and it is in my soul and it is the condition I want and you put this in front of a President and say he says mine too, yours is so strong and that of the President is devious and it is of lower strength it will shine like nothing.<br>凯史：如果你懂得这，不仅仅你能看到基督的灵魂，而是你和基督在一起。然后你想知道是否他是棕色眼睛还是蓝色眼睛。他是金发人或黑发人？所以在系统核内、在中心，你创造了基督的灵魂的能量场。如果你的意图真实，你将理解，即使没有光，你也能看到灵魂。屏幕上要有光，需要太阳高强度的能量与地球地强度的磁引力场相互作用。如果你创造了正确的场，没有光，你将会看到非常透明的没有颜色的黑暗，然后你就会看到灵魂。当你有不同的愿望，这光就会告诉你。如果我的意愿是和平，它在我的灵魂中，它是我需要的环境。如果你把这系统放在一个总统的面前，你会发现你的场很强，总统的不够光亮，场强较弱，好像没有什么闪耀一样。</p>
<p>第七部分笔译——子不语</p>
<p>K: And those of you who are pure in heart and have the same understanding and intention of the soul as blessed is his name Mohammed or Christ, and we count Moses totally out as he has been demoted to (the level of) the man and shall not be called a prophet. Then you shall see. Then you shall understand why we have come to this point to deliver. The man has gone too far to stop this mayhem they have created. Then if you can create and understand the strength of the level of the elements which give you the strength of the fields of the soul of the man of peace load up your reactors and let them run anywhere on this planet. You learned about the radishes next to each other and how they grew the same and why the radishes before used to last ten days. Once one of the human race reaches the state of the soul of the peace, it will go around the world like a hot wire.<br>你们当中的一些心灵纯粹、灵魂上具有相同的共识、意图，得到穆罕默德和基督保佑的人，我们把摩西也排除在外，因为他灵魂的级别已降级至人类，就不能称作先知了。然后你们会看到，会明白我们为什么要出于这种情况去说明，因为人类做得太过分了，以致不能停止他们已制造的杀戮。如果你能建立或理解这些基本原理的真相，这些产生人类灵魂和平磁场的真相，加载你们的反应器，让它们在这个星球上任意运行。你们要知道，萝卜是一个挨着一个长在一起的，为什么却长成一样？一旦人类的灵魂达到了和平的状态，它就会像星星之火一样在世界被点燃。</p>
<p>K: now those of you who have been crying I am peaceful; I want peace build your system. Those of you who don’t do it is (because of) the fear of yourselves and your hands will be opened and (show) your true intentions. (2.54.46 minutes) We do not start a witch hunt; but we start the state of the truth of mankind because this is enough. As I have said in my time there shall not be any murders. I will not kill souls but I allow the souls to release their feeble strength into the level to raise the level of the souls they have done wrong to. If the world leaders knew what we thought today, we shall see mass funerals as I promised on Tuesday. But, the world leaders I have bad news for you—physicality doesn’t count. We thank no nation and we thank no leaders as all have done some wrong to be in the position they are and those who have done wrong to keep to the material state soon will take the march in confessing their own things and trying to put it right.<br>现在那些声称自已是和平人士，渴望和平的人，请创建你的系统。那些因为自身害怕而不敢去做的人，你的双手会被打开，并展示出你的本心。我们不以政治迫害开始，我们从人类的本真状态开始，因为那已足够了。就如我说过的，在我有生之年不要看到任何杀戮。我不会扼杀灵魂，但我允许灵魂释放它们微弱的力量去供养那些行为已注成错误的人，提升他们的灵魂级别。如果世界领袖们知道我们今天所思考的问题，如我在星期二承诺的，我们会看到葬礼。但世界领袖们，我有坏消息要和你们说—物质层面的已经没有价值了。我们期盼的没有国家没有领袖的格局已经形成，在还有一些失误的前提下，导致持续这些局面的那些人，他们要立刻忏悔他们的行为并设法改过。</p>
<p>K: We will see unions break up. We will see a lot of things opening up that it brings peace to man. I have done my job and I warned you a few weeks ago that I would stop teaching. I have taught you everything. I guide you to bring peace and I will bring you the message in one language. The universal community has an open door for mankind when the mankind dares to open the door to join in. It is not us who have locked you out; it is you, by what you have done wrong to yourselves, have locked yourselves in. We knocked on the door of the human race many times. And those who opened the door in small gaps took the gift and abused what was inside. We ended up with the Rothschilds family that abused the knowledge that we gave them with the ‘benefit’ of more or less torturing humanity. There shall be no Rothschilds as we are finished with Judaism too.<br>我们将看到工会解体，看到大量的事物扩大开放，为人类带来和平。我的使命已经完成，我几周前通知过的我会停止教学，我已经教了你们所有的东西，我引导你们朝和平的方向走，我会用一种语言给你带来信息。宇宙社区有一个为人类敞开的大门，当人类敢于打开这扇大门的时候，不是我把你拒之门外，而是你自已，你自身所犯下的错误，把你锁住了，我们多次向人类敲门，那些把门打开一点小缝隙的人，他们拿走了礼物并在监狱里滥用。我们结束了罗斯柴尔德家族，他们滥用我们给他们的知识，伴随着或多或少的利益却给人类带来灾难，这里不再有罗斯柴尔德同时我们也终结了犹太组织。</p>
<p>K: build your reactors on the intention of the peace and start understanding how to create the field strength of the soul of the man and then you will reach the man itself. You elevate the soul of the man and in elevating himself and knowing he doesn’t deserve to be elevated for what he has done wrong, kings shall fall, leaders will not be there, and the corridors of finance and power become nonexistent. And that was my job and that is why I accepted this mission when I accepted it and it was so bad that I had to come in person myself to do the job as the messengers messed it up more and more. So, we have two choices as the human race today—go to the next step to create peace or go to the next step and I annihilate the totality of the energy and you have to wait in this village of the earth for thousands of years cutting each others’ throats, eating each others’ flesh, killing each other for a few pennies. Outside, as I have said before, two meters above this earth no money or no gold has any value.<br>带着和平的意愿去创建你的反应器，并开始认识如何建立人类灵魂磁场强度，再延伸到人类自身。你提升了人类的灵魂，由于他自身灵魂的提高，他们会意识到他们所做的错事是多少不值得。皇室将会解散，不会再有所谓的领袖，金融界的势力及其影响将不复存在，那是我的职责，也是我这次为什么接受这项使命的原因，我接受它时，情况太糟糕了，我要亲自来完成这项工作，充当信使，解决这糟糕的现状。所以，人类今天有两个选择，转到下一步开创和平（新纪元），或是进入下一步，我消毁所有的能量，你们就得在地球这个村庄等上数千年，（其间）相互杀戮，相互食啖，为了几便士相互残杀！除此以外，就如我上面说的两条道路，地球上不再有金钱，或者说黄金也不再有任何价值。</p>
<p>K: In the universe we have no money. We exchange and give from our souls to elevate the others because then we can reach for whatever we need. Is the man mature enough to join us or do we have to bring so much that the man does not understand where he comes from? Those who abused shall talk of their own abuse; those who served will shine like a star in the human race across the universe. I have done my job and it is for you to find that circle beyond the zinc and once you find that and understand that, then you decide to see the true man. You will all find out that your physicality is irrelevant because what you have got, you can create as much as you like. It is you who decides what will be at the end of it. You have the potential to do so. We still live among men like the man not to stand out but we see the soul of the man through our own strength. I said and I repeat those who have committed murders shall respond (? 3.00.54 minutes). If it needs be we shall bring their souls.<br>宇宙中没有金钱。我们通过灵魂上的交换和给予来提升彼此，因为我们可以从（宇宙中）任何地方得到我们所需要的。人类是否已足够成熟来加入我们，或者说我们（的内心）真的要抓取那么多东西吗？人类压根不知道他们是从哪里来的，（损人不会利已，）那些伤害会回到他们自已身上，而有一颗服务大众的心就会像一颗穿越宇宙的星星在人群中闪耀。我已经完成我的使命，剩下的就是你们去发现超越锌的旋转，一旦你发现并懂得了其中的原理，接下来你就发心去看真实的人类，你会更加发现肉体和你不相干，因为你可以尽可能按你喜欢的方式去创造，那个才是你，它才能决定你最终是什么状态。你有潜能去那样做，我们仍生活在人类当中，就像人们根本不需要站出来，但是我们可以通过我们的力量看到人类的灵魂，我说过了，现在再次重复这些，那些参与谋杀的该回应了吧？如果有必要，我们会把他们的灵魂带过来。</p>
<p>K: I tell you one thing which is impossibility: accidents the day before the revelation and the same position of the address or junction of my house is impossibility. If it was a kilometer up or two kilometers down, yes. Look at the accident point; then you will understand that the target was to warn. We received the warning but in a way we never thought the man would be so low who responded back. We take your soul and then you have no body to live in. There are no coincidences.<br>我告诉你们一件不可能的事情：大揭露前一天的事故，事故地址的同一位置，如果是一公里以上两公里以下，看事故的现场，你们就明白目标是报警器，我们接到预警，但以这种方式，我们没想到回应的声音这么低沉，这没有巧合。</p>
<p>K: From my talk of last week I said to you do not make any assumptions and do not make any theories. And I said to you this was a pure accident; it was the accident of the greed and blocking the man to elevate. Unfortunately those who created it and those who created such mayhem and problem around the Foundation now it serves you your own soul to eat of the flesh of the bodies you have destroyed. That is your problem.<br>按我上周的交谈，我对你们说过不要作任何的假想，不要作任何理论。我也和你们说过，这是一个纯粹事故，这是贪婪心引发的意外想阻止人类的提升。很不幸的是，制造这些蓄意破坏行为的人就在基金会附近，你自已的灵魂要为此负责，你要为你所造成的一切行为自食其果，那是你自找的。</p>
<p>K: I am not here to take revenge; I am here to elevate the soul of the man but those who have tried very hard to obstruct the development this time, you have failed. I will stay here until the time we deliver the totality of mankind on the platform of peace to the universal community. Those of you who escape in <strong>__</strong> (3.03.02 minutes) or God knows in what shape or form we will knock on your doors our way. No problem. We had to find the connection and we did find a connection when as I said we kicked the dog and the cat meowed. We have found connection between the royal families of Europe who murdered scientists. We have found the money trace in Panama and other places. We have found the hidden connections of the operation and in time it will be released by those who work for the peace of mankind across the Keshe Foundation and organizations worldwide.<br>我在这里不是为了报仇，而是为了提升人类的灵魂，这次挖空心思企图阻止这一进程的人，你们失败了，我会留在这里直到人类总体进入宇宙和平社区，那些逃跑的人（3.03.02听不清）或者说上帝知道他们的去向，不要紧，我们会以我们的方式找上门的，我们要找到这个线索，通过如我说过的顺藤摸瓜找这个线索。我们已经发现谋杀科学家们的欧盟皇室之间的关系网，我们已经找到了钱从巴拿马转到其它地方的线索，我们已经发现其操作的隐蔽性，适当时候，它会由这些为人类和平而工作的组织通过凯史基金会在世界各地公布。</p>
<p>K: there shall be no king because these kings have done a lot of wrong and now it is time for the payback of their souls and nothing else. Be very, very careful in how you start developing and start understanding the level of the soul and creation of the soul in the free plasma condition. If you do not do this you come to see things that you are not prepared for. You can only understand in what you can see and in what your level of understanding is. Today is the day of Revelation and now we have revealed. It is for you to understand what we are about to do and what you do to yourself. We are here about to free man from the shackles of his own physicality and the others who wanted to use it and have done so. Thank you very much for today.<br>这里不再有国王，因为国王已犯下大量的错误，而现是要他们的灵魂作出偿还的时候了，除此之外没有别的。要非常非常小心的开始研发及认知灵魂的等级，和自由等离子体条件下灵魂的创造，如果你不这样做，就看到各种幻像，那说明你还没准备好。你理解的层面仅限于你能看到的东西及在你的灵魂级别上能认知的事物，今天是揭露的日子，我们已经揭露了。是为你让你们理解我们将要做的是什么，而你们自已又要做些什么。我们在这里是要把人类从他们肉身的枷锁解放出来，还有其它想继续使用物理身体的。</p>
